[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]
Never know who will call Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.280]
Howard David, voice of the Miami Dolls.

[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.220]
I'm not sure you want it and you don't need the sheath.

[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.020]
It was plugged, but I will buy listening to you guys every day.

[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.780]
You guys are doing a hell of a job. It's fun to listen to and O'Brien.

[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.680]
I mean the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.360]
What? Did I hear that right? Back up with you.

[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.940]
I listen to you guys every day. You guys are doing a hell of a job.

[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.360]
It's fun to listen to and O'Brien. I mean the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.500]
Wow, even Mo Howard David listens to Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.760]
Exactly. I'm getting pounded. You should have supported your own station.

[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.480]
Well, I don't understand. Well hold it. Hold it. What is one thing?

[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.140]
I don't understand. Well, one thing has to do with another.

[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.140]
I'm on a network show that happens to be carried on another station in the marketplace.

[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.640]
Also, so, Hank, you go on everybody's show opposite yours at the same time.

[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.120]
You think, Hank, you go on their station when you're on the air?

[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.340]
If Hank Goldberg appears on another radio program that happens to be carried in the marketplace,

[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.600]
it's a network show that happens to be on opposite me.

[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.100]
I don't give a damn about that. Why would I care about it?

[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.740]
Why does that matter?

[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.180]
It's all competition in numbers, Howard. You know the business.

[00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.780]
You know how it works. I just don't think you want to support Neil Rogers.

[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.160]
Well, now you're bringing up something that's completely different.

[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.540]
No, I think that's probably the biggest problem you got.

[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.700]
You don't like Neil Rogers and you wanted to go opposite of him and you really didn't care who you offended.

[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.260]
Well, one of the ones I tell you what, since the man is standing in the controller right now,

[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.540]
why does the Neil Rogers tell you, since the day I walked into this place,

[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.420]
he's done everything he can, undermine this program, since we're now getting down to brass tax.

[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.780]
I'm looking right in the eye and telling my now to his face.

[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.560]
I think you brought some of that on yourself.

[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.600]
You blamed him.

[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.980]
I might be even bothering arguing.

[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.340]
Whether or not I'm appearing on a network show, what the hell is that?

[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.080]
I have to do with anything.

[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.840]
And if the object is to get me pissed off, didn't.

[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.760]
Trust me when I tell you, it didn't.

[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.140]
Think 53 at QAM.

[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.640]
Damn it.

[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.480]
Anyway, it's a 903 is what it is now, almost whatever it is, 10 minutes later.

[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.100]
That was pretty exciting. I just happened to be standing because they have the door open this morning,

[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.060]
which is very exciting.

[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.640]
So I could go in there and bond with Zach and Robert, my good close personal friends.

[00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.240]
Robert's gloating about the election.

[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.400]
I'm Tonya Robert.

[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.880]
If we discover these anal love beads yesterday, instead of Georgia's stupid rosary beads,

[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.300]
the Democrats would have kicked that ass.

[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.800]
But anyway, here this call happens to be unjust at the same moment.

[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.980]
There's my psychic powers kicking again.

[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.220]
And I'm listening to the call.

[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.100]
I was about to turn around and walk out because Muget's very upset when he sees me.

[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.940]
It's physically ill.

[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.200]
And I was about to turn around and walk out.

[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.500]
I hear this call going on about me and about the fact that Muget's on

[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.820]
concerning with the enemy on Monday.

[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.880]
See this business about it being a network show.

[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.920]
I mean, what what the hell's Zach out to do with an addition to which he wasn't a guest on the show he called in?

[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.120]
He called it not a show.

[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.360]
He was on the phone.

[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.660]
It's not like it was a guest in the studio or an invited guest.

[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.040]
He called in and was on the Irw

[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.480]
Tony Bruno on Schlock Sports.

[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.160]
And I think the caller had a good point.

[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.760]
That is you don't concern with the enemy.

[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.820]
But yeah, that's the way it goes.

[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.800]
I really didn't make that big of an issue out of it.

[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.660]
We got the promo on her, which we got through Hooker Cruck, which we find most amusing,

[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.000]
especially the part where she says even Mohawar David listens to it,

[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.740]
etc. and so on.

[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.000]
See now you're getting your mean bastard.

[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.880]
You really are. It's all you.

[00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.260]
It's not me, Moh. It's all George.

[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.540]
You're right in the first place.

[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.680]
And then that line he's got in there about since the day he got here,

[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.460]
I was trying to undermine that show.

[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.260]
See how soon they forget.

[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.500]
Now you can go on here and lie through your teeth

[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.440]
all your sports sick of fans out there.

[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.980]
But the truth of the matter is I was the only one give any support.

[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.400]
The only one because of those quotes in very jackasses column.

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.420]
Remember the origins of that back in the spring back in the late winter, whenever it

[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.660]
was?

[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.360]
He was going to show him what sports talk was really all about and sports talk is boring.

[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.600]
And so some of the other people on this station, which I don't want to mention any names,

[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.400]
took exception of that.

[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.860]
And I can see that. I can see their point.

[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.060]
And so they got off on a wrong foot.

[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.000]
But as far as I was concerned, I kind of like enjoyed that because you know me.

[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.220]
I'm a Schmidt Disturber and I'm not part of the sports doc fraternity anyway.

[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.760]
So I gave him all the opportunity in the world.

[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.260]
And then of course, you're running around making comments about his bad hair piece and about

[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.920]
the checkered pants. And I may have embellished him just a little bit.

[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.260]
A little bit.

[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.480]
But and then of course right away he had.

[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.260]
And then we had the thing with Greg and him in here that day.

[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.380]
I thought we kissed and made up.

[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.800]
Remember that?

[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.320]
Student right there, front of that microphone.

[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.020]
I played one of the Boca Brian Moa Howard bits laughed and laughed.

[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.080]
The fact of the matter is he just has got no sense of humor when it comes to himself.

[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.080]
And so it continues to escalate and escalate.

[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.360]
And of course the audience loves it.

[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.460]
Look at the you look at a response we had on the pool yesterday.

[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.600]
Look at the response.

[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.120]
And you want to know why like I said the other day about Joseph Gackie and I.

[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.080]
Joe's Joe gets it.

[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.960]
He's like a real person.

[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.400]
I mean, I've been saying on the year for years that he's boring.

[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.780]
He's the most boring person on the year I can think of.

[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.380]
And he is.

[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.340]
But that doesn't make him a bad guy.

[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.640]
That doesn't mean we hate each other.

[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.440]
He understands it.

[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.040]
He gets it.

[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.440]
He understands it's a radio show.

[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.260]
And if somebody wants to say this show sucks, I'm a moron.

[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.300]
We got a bunch of trained monkeys.

[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.080]
That doesn't bother me because it's a radio show.

[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.800]
It's not going to change my life.

[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.340]
1131 votes on yesterday's pool.

[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.760]
Our question was what should the punishment be for Mohawar David sucking up to the

[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.900]
enemy Fox Boards Monday?

[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.680]
Who's Mohawar David 391 14 and let me also say this.

[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.780]
What what other publicity does he get from this radio station?

[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.400]
Another any billboards any TV spots any.

[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.060]
No, nothing.

[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.440]
Any guy walking up and down the cause with a sandwich board?

[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.100]
No, nothing.

[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.780]
Any sky writing like Jim had over nothing.

[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.920]
Absolutely nothing.

[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.600]
So I brought that show to the attention.

[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.340]
Don't give me the song and it's about, well, yeah, you'll be ripping.

[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.200]
That's not the point.

[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.140]
That's not the way it works, especially in this market.

[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.180]
That's not the way it works.

[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.440]
There've been more people tuning that show because of my talking about it

[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.680]
than all the publicity in the world could have done.

[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.040]
No contest.

[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.540]
And if you just expect me to sit here and go out about, well,

[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.940]
yeah, it's going to be a wonderful show and you better tune in.

[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.900]
They're not going to do that.

[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.380]
I can't tell people what to listen to.

[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.560]
There reminds me the 10 William Days on Zeta.

[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.500]
Oh, if you just talk better about our music,

[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.380]
talk better.

[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.880]
Maybe if you played better music, maybe people listened to it.

[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.740]
Like I'm going to talk, it's like going into a restaurant.

[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.420]
Maybe I could be the greeter at a restaurant.

[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.900]
Like Larry Glick, I could be the greeter at some restaurant where the food is really crappy.

[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.880]
And I could stand on the doorway and say, oh, it really is crappy.

[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.380]
But, you know, I'm telling you, I'm here to tell you it's really good.

[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.100]
And they're going to come pouring in there because I'm standing on the doorway,

[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.000]
telling that it's dog crap, but it really is filet mignon.

[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.920]
It looks like dog crap, but it smells like it, and probably it's really filet mignon.

[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.480]
It's really shatter, but I don't know.

[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.020]
Ain't going to happen.

[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.300]
1136 votes.

[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.740]
Who's Mohawar David at 394?

[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.040]
Fire is old, I asked 298.

[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.160]
Still his two pays 172.

[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.780]
He gets raped and it by the whole staff, 109.

[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.680]
Vanishing from Paradise, 63.

[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.880]
No penalty, he gets a gold star at a purple jellybean, 55, 4.8%.

[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.560]
He gets raped and it by freaky carlos, only 45.

[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.700]
That's not really because what I thought about you.

[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.640]
I don't know why he only gets 45 with freaky carlos.

[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.520]
Because nobody has any idea who that is.

[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.080]
Nobody knows who that is.

[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.700]
We need to accept it.

[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.820]
Except for the handful of former power 96 morning show listeners,

[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.420]
when freaky carlos was on air.

[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:01.000]
What?

[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.160]
Right.

[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.480]
Well, no, I mean, we don't have that much crossover with power 96.

[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:05.560]
That's not our audience.

[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.500]
So most of our people don't know from the old Bushville Griffin show

[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.860]
and carlos or whatever.

[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.180]
What do he call himself on that show?

[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.460]
Lida?

[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.960]
Lida?

[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.420]
Oh, take me to your Lida.

[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.740]
Not.

[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.580]
But seriously, the scene that we just had in there,

[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.180]
I have no idea what they had that door open.

[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.700]
Although, now I realize it's probably a better idea to have it closed.

[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.580]
And every time I would look in there, he would see me.

[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.020]
He just like, uh, like he just saw the ghost of Christmas pass

[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:30.520]
through something.

[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.200]
It's a radio show.

[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.200]
Howard, that's all it is.

[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.400]
It's a freaking radio show.

[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.220]
And you can have a heart on the rest of your life

[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.160]
about neo-Rangers and about George Rodriguez and about the beast

[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.840]
and about anybody who consorts with us.

[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.720]
It's just a radio show.

[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.080]
Well, don't forget, Boca Brine.

[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.780]
Oh, well, forget about him singing all those things.

[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.220]
Talking about getting raped a bit because rape ain't funny.

[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.740]
But, boy, we got a situation here, man.

[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:55.920]
It's just astonishing.

[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.160]
I, people ask me, say they come up to me and say,

[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.460]
have you really ever encountered anything like this before?

[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.900]
And I say, nah, never even dreamed there could be something like this.

[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.840]
And when that guy called that we just played that call,

[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.740]
you could see the blood rolling around right underneath the hair piece.

[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.260]
I mean, it was just, boy, I thought it was going to boil right over.

[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.060]
And maybe the bag, also, at the same time.

[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:18.940]
It was bubbling.

[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.600]
You know how like a radiator when it overheats,

[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.300]
starts bubbling?

[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.660]
Well, that's what was going on in there.

[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.220]
I'm not sure exactly where it was coming from.

[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.100]
It's a radio show, Mo.

[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.320]
Oh, Howard.

[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.900]
I don't think I'm going to have much success.

[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.060]
I've tried everything I know.

[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.240]
I've extended a hand of friendship.

[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.520]
I've offered all, you know, all kind of accommodation.

[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.460]
Remember the thing about where you were being held hostage, right?

[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.400]
And if I would back off on mode,

[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.680]
and you wouldn't get canned, well, you know,

[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.540]
that's too many months ago.

[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.940]
That ain't going to fly anymore, all right?

[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:45.780]
And I did.

[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:46.620]
And I backed off.

[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.960]
And then I came back here for a few days.

[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.980]
And then we had our little birthday party in there.

[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.300]
And by the way, nobody came in here from that show

[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.380]
and wished me happy birthday.

[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.340]
At least nobody from that side of the window,

[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.440]
including Gildi.

[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.260]
But back on June 3,

[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.920]
when we had that birthday bash in there,

[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.640]
at least I was invited to come in and kiss his highness' ring

[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.620]
and wish him happy birthday.

[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.000]
At that point, that was an ugly day.

[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.440]
Turned out, I thought it was just fun.

[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.140]
We sat down and there was invited.

[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.320]
I didn't want to be on there.

[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.060]
Sat down and invited me to sit down in the Beyond That Show.

[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.680]
And I thought we had fun for five or ten minutes.

[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:23.860]
It sounded fun from here.

[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.120]
Everybody else I talked to said it was a bunch of yucks.

[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.700]
It was okay.

[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.760]
And he took exception to that.

[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:29.860]
He just didn't get it.

[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.320]
I don't think there's anybody in this building

[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.420]
who has either the ability or maybe even the desire

[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.240]
to explain it to him.

[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:34.880]
It doesn't get it.

[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.020]
So we have this massive war going on.

[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.240]
But it's a war on one side.

[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.780]
See, that's the thing I don't understand.

[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.940]
There's no war from this side.

[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.220]
We're just having some fun.

[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.580]
And people might say,

[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.080]
wow, gee, but those vits you're planning,

[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:46.740]
you're ripping...

[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.060]
They're comedy bits.

[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.140]
Who don't we have bits about?

[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.580]
Yeah, who don't we have bits, including me?

[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.360]
And about George and about everybody.

[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.200]
About Boka Brian.

[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.660]
Everybody else in a goddamn radio station.

[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.580]
Josh Friedman.

[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.860]
Do you think that fat tub of crap

[00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.820]
is going to come in here and say,

[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.500]
oh, gee, you really hurt my feelings?

[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.980]
He wanted a copy of it.

[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.160]
He plays it for his family.

[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.020]
How about Geldie?

[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.320]
Before he became an underling.

[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.520]
How about the Geldie song that he was running around singing

[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.620]
like we talked about the other day.

[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:10.620]
Singing it in bars.

[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.000]
He was performing it.

[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.060]
I don't get it.

[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.400]
11 after 9 at 5, 60 WQM.

[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.600]
Let me tell you one thing I do get

[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.860]
and that is how you buy a mattress.

[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:20.880]
This is something I know.

[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.600]
I mean, I know nothing about anything else in the world

[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.380]
but I do know this.

[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.500]
And that is that the old way of buying a mattress is done.

[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.040]
It's finished.

[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:27.720]
It's finito.

[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.640]
All you have to do is pick up your instrument,

[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.500]
pick up that phone,

[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.800]
reach forward, grab it, squeeze it, and the phone too,

[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.560]
and call 1-800-MATRICE

[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.840]
if the old mattress is lumpy and smelly and worn out.

[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.820]
And these folks will bring you a no-time-at-all

[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.100]
quality name brand mattress exactly the one you're looking for

[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.980]
at an unbeatable everyday low price.

[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.620]
And when I'm talking about brand names,

[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.560]
they've got the best they got.

[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.160]
Serta, Celi, Simmons, King, Coral.

[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.400]
No store in the universe can match those low prices

[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.020]
and certainly nobody would even dream a match

[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.580]
in the service you get from these people

[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.340]
with dial amateurs because they deliver

[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.540]
when it's convenient for you.

[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.380]
They come right to your home when that mattress you order.

[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.740]
They take away the old crappy bedding

[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.120]
and set up the new one in any to our window when you want.

[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.140]
Noon to two, one to three,

[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.820]
etc. any day of the week, seven days a week.

[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.280]
And they give you that 30-day-in-home comfort guarantee

[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.180]
to check it out the only smart way by sleeping on it

[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.680]
and do whatever you want to do on it.

[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.120]
So pick up that thing, grab it, reach it, squeeze it,

[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.840]
and call dial amateurs right now 1-800-MATRICE,

[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.260]
1-800-MATR-R-E-S, they'll be there in no time at all.

[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.340]
Or look on a website at macrus.com if you like.

[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.300]
5-8-Local, this is 5-6-L, 3-6-L,

[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.460]
3-6-L, you're so mean.

[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.680]
2-8-L!

[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.340]
A bush, a bush, a knife, a knife!

[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.420]
Gordon Lightfoot, he's more popular than ever.

[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.400]
I didn't know that.

[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.040]
Well, now you do.

[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.060]
And now Gordon Lightfoot boards the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.300]
and steers a course for disaster in his new tribute album,

[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.140]
Gordon Lightfoot sinks Led Zeppelin.

[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.800]
Tased and confused, Gordon Lightfoot renders his version of Led Zeppelin's

[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.140]
Immigrant Song.

[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.980]
We come from the land of the high source though

[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.900]
On the midnight sun where the hot springs blow

[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.000]
Gordon Lightfoot sinks Led Zeppelin.

[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.460]
It's a whole lot of stuff like this.

[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.760]
It's the compact disc that's lower than the bottom of Lake Superior.

[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.700]
If there's a bustle in your CD player,

[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.980]
don't be alarmed now.

[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.300]
It's just Gordon Lightfoot sinks Led Zeppelin.

[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.800]
917-F-Boy, that's your end of the rough, you know.

[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.900]
At 560 WDQAM, happy year Wednesday to you.

[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.480]
And you're on something where you got a pool today on the election.

[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.220]
What's your take on Tuesday's election results?

[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.860]
You know why I voted? I don't give a shmit.

[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.860]
Didn't I say it was going to be Republican sweep?

[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.800]
My psychic power's righted again.

[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:01.500]
I could feel it.

[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.860]
I just knew it.

[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.120]
And the guy that called us yesterday about his death

[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.980]
and his problems with the appalling place in Broward

[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.220]
was also on Channel 4 News last night.

[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.420]
And obviously there were a few people that didn't have those problems.

[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.420]
But the margin was so lopsided one way or the other.

[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.980]
Plus, the media did a great job of convincing everybody in Broward

[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.300]
that they'd have a two or three hour wait that nobody showed up.

[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.620]
That was a good way to make sure that nobody,

[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.160]
and I'm not blaming any part of it.

[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.220]
And I'm just saying the media really screwed up big time.

[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.660]
Oh, it's going to be two or three hour waits

[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.780]
and they have two few machines and they've got two thousand more machines.

[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.680]
And it turns out that 35% of the people

[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.520]
are less in Broward showed up, 34%.

[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.020]
I think.

[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.700]
So there were no lines and there were no votes.

[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.640]
But that made no difference because it was a landslide.

[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.020]
Because this country is turning more and more to the right.

[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.820]
The guy that called yesterday who said there's more of us

[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:44.780]
than there are view, you're right.

[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.000]
You are right.

[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.840]
2000, that wasn't the case in the presidential election.

[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.380]
Now it absolutely is.

[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.800]
Don't ever, or ever, overestimate the intelligence

[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.980]
of the American electorate out there.

[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.260]
And of course, don't ever, overestimate the intelligence

[00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.220]
of the Democratic Party.

[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.500]
Because like I told you yesterday, man, they had,

[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.260]
they had nothing.

[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.980]
They sat back and they cowered in the corner.

[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.520]
Well, we better not talk about this.

[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.080]
We better not attack the president.

[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.500]
Well, that's what you got.

[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.180]
You got nothing.

[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:08.740]
You got squat.

[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.720]
You got creamed, baby.

[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.900]
You got slaughtered.

[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.680]
Even ancient Walter Mondale.

[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:16.860]
Creamed.

[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.140]
So the problems have the Senate.

[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.300]
They got the House.

[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.500]
They got the White House.

[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.700]
They got the Supreme Court.

[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.260]
They got all these other judgeships

[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.380]
that they'll have to be able to confirm.

[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.700]
They got, they got it.

[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.060]
They got the country by the balls.

[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.660]
So that's our poll question.

[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.340]
What's your take on yesterday's election results?

[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.340]
I don't give a shmit.

[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.060]
I'm suicidal.

[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.920]
I'm ecstatic.

[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.860]
I'm ready to leave the country

[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.240]
or they're all a bunch of crooks.

[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.740]
Those are your choices on a poll.

[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.200]
Here's the facts from Rick, who says,

[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.460]
happy birthday of the yesterday's election in the debacle.

[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.440]
The only polls I'll be going to next time

[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.200]
will be the quarter poll or the eighth poll at Calder.

[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:47.860]
There you go.

[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.560]
Good choice, Rick.

[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:49.900]
Don't blame you.

[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.600]
Why do I waste the time?

[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.200]
You know, I'm a, uh,

[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.960]
what, and I haven't seen him in the morning for, uh,

[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:57.820]
Koon's age.

[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.980]
But I was channel surf in this morning,

[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.200]
and there he was with that, you know,

[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.220]
the dead man in a chair.

[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:03.360]
And I give him credit.

[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.880]
He was talking about the election

[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.480]
and about how CBS and Dan Reather

[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.600]
are so liberal and biased,

[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.500]
which he's right about that,

[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.340]
and about how CNN is just so obnoxious

[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.480]
all the way around and how they're

[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.520]
smug and whatever they say is the truth.

[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.040]
And then he also said,

[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.020]
which my ears really perked up,

[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.380]
just like, like this, my antenna.

[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.040]
He said, you know, as far as Fox News,

[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.140]
he said they're even worse.

[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.260]
He said they all want to be wearing sheets over there.

[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.920]
How do you like that, Heather?

[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.320]
He said all you people at Fox

[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.060]
ought to be wearing sheets,

[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.160]
and that's the newly conservative Don

[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.740]
I'm just in last years after his rehab.

[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:32.760]
After you had to give up the bottle,

[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.180]
all of a sudden he came back as a conservative.

[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.100]
But nevertheless, in spite of being a conservative,

[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.520]
nevertheless, he still says the people at Fox News

[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.420]
ought to be wearing sheets.

[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.160]
How do you like that?

[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.640]
Absolutely correct.

[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.860]
Always like that, I'm a,

[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.080]
you know, even when he was alive.

[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.740]
So that's the way the election came out.

[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.000]
I'm sure going to get a lot of calls today,

[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.800]
and you can call up and say,

[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.600]
Na na na na.

[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.920]
And do your usual childish thing.

[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.960]
We were like, like, Robert,

[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:53.380]
well, Robert,

[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.800]
no, he was pretty civilized about it.

[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.100]
He was too busy trying to referee,

[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.620]
you know, between what else was going on in there.

[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.500]
Trying to stay on the chair while he and Zach

[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.680]
were laughing their ass off.

[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.100]
See everybody,

[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.140]
am I the only one who's who picks up on that

[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.900]
that it seems like maybe they're just doing it

[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.160]
for my benefit when I'm around.

[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.600]
But it seems to me like all of the other people

[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.000]
I encounter in this building understand the stick.

[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:14.940]
They have a sense of humor.

[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:15.740]
Am I wrong about that?

[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.580]
No, not just in the building.

[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.140]
Everywhere we've ever been.

[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.120]
No, I'm not forget about outside the building.

[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.760]
I'm just talking about the current situation.

[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.940]
Oh, yeah, the current Moe situation.

[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:24.780]
Moe, it goes on.

[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.460]
The Moe, he becomes psychotic.

[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:27.420]
Yes.

[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.880]
And also, let me say this to you,

[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.000]
it's one thing even assuming his premise

[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.420]
about calling another network out of town radio show

[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.580]
is no big deal.

[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.500]
See, it's one thing to call in and make a comment

[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.340]
about the ball game or about whatever it is you,

[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.240]
the topic might be.

[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.740]
It's another thing to suck up and say,

[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.200]
oh, yeah, I listen to you guys every day.

[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.160]
See, they're the competitor.

[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.440]
Even for him, they're the competitor,

[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.440]
but that makes no difference.

[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.020]
Because that's not important.

[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.840]
What is important is to drive the stake

[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.480]
through the heart, to give the old twist

[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.620]
and give the stilch.

[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.400]
That's what's important.

[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.780]
So, one last time, I extend the hand of friendship

[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.960]
for this meeting that has been proposed that I proposed.

[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:06.700]
I suggested it.

[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.800]
Because I think that's the only way to clear the error.

[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.120]
We're going to have like World War four here.

[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.640]
Of course, I'm not going to be here most of the time anyway.

[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.120]
I'm busy going to that Martha Stewart class.

[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.780]
I still don't get that.

[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.160]
Do you?

[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.860]
No, not even the second time.

[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:21.240]
No.

[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.200]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T

[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.380]
If Ryzen Line the pull is up on yesterday's election,

[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.860]
is that thing working or not?

[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.420]
Because my vote is on it.

[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.740]
Or maybe they just don't care.

[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.060]
Or maybe they're hiding under the bed.

[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.120]
Our audience, a lot of them.

[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.140]
They're just in hiding now.

[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.900]
Maybe they're at the passport office.

[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.540]
Now, I don't think it's up there yet.

[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.560]
Well, Erica let us know.

[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:42.540]
W-D-Q-A-N.

[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.080]
I'd like to finish the meal.

[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.060]
I beg your pardon?

[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.160]
Happy birthday, still.

[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:47.440]
Thanks.

[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:47.900]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.580]
I heard that little phone call there.

[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.080]
Yeah.

[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.900]
Read my lips in three months that guys gone.

[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.000]
You're going to run them out of the door here.

[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.260]
I'm not running and I see that's not the thing to say

[00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.780]
because I'm not trying to win anybody out.

[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.020]
But that's his personality.

[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.040]
It's not you as him.

[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:01.460]
Yeah.

[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.740]
He can't take that kind of crap.

[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.080]
That's his problem.

[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:04.960]
You can hear it in his voice.

[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.680]
He gets all hyped up in his face.

[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.900]
He was hyped up on that call.

[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.220]
He was kind of scary.

[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.160]
I was worried for him.

[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.300]
I don't like the guy.

[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.540]
But anyway, that's beside the point.

[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.160]
Happy birthday.

[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.440]
It's great to hear you.

[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.620]
Let's fly to Amsterdam.

[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.860]
Let's blow a fat one over there.

[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.180]
Okay.

[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.940]
Although Josh Friedman never was my type.

[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.520]
5.6705.60.

[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.060]
Pound 5.60 on the AT&T in Verizon.

[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.760]
Why are we saying blow a fat one?

[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.480]
That pull going to be up or not.

[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.060]
Did Eric, do we have any idea?

[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.340]
Maybe they just have no interest in that thing now.

[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:34.660]
I don't know.

[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.980]
It's obviously not working.

[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:38.680]
WDQAM.

[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.460]
Yes, I was kind of finding out.

[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.560]
It's not show on still tonight that two in the morning

[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:42.980]
is fixed.

[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:44.800]
Is it still on?

[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.500]
You're overnight guys.

[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:45.860]
Yeah.

[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.060]
Okay, I was just curious.

[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.160]
And what else did you think about that?

[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.760]
This whole referendum was for George W.

[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.340]
He took it to the Democrats.

[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.700]
He went and campaigned and kicked their butts.

[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.360]
Don't you agree?

[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:56.760]
Yes.

[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:57.540]
Thank you.

[00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.160]
Have a great day.

[00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:58.500]
Okay.

[00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.160]
Yeah, he did.

[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:00.700]
He did.

[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.340]
He raised a record amount of money.

[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.580]
He went out there and, you know,

[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.500]
whether you like him or don't, which I don't.

[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.140]
But he got the job done.

[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.360]
That's what it's all about.

[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.880]
It's not about the best interest of the public.

[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.100]
It's about partisan politics.

[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.660]
In spite of all this crap about, wow, that's your...

[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.200]
Baloney.

[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.200]
That's what it's all about.

[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.240]
Because they all represent special interests.

[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.080]
Democrats have got labor and they're special interests.

[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.900]
And the Republicans have got the oil people and whatever.

[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.100]
And that's what it's all about.

[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.920]
And the public, well, we're screwed no matter what.

[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.040]
Spatter what some of you might think.

[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.200]
We're screwed all the time.

[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.660]
Paul's working like I told you.

[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.780]
See, you're getting more like him all the time.

[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:35.700]
Like who?

[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.080]
What's your take on Tuesday's election needs?

[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:40.780]
Results needs.

[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.040]
I'm ready to leave the country.

[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:42.420]
Six.

[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.340]
There are all a bunch of quirks.

[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.020]
I'm suicidal too.

[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:45.960]
I'm ecstatic. One.

[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.960]
And I said, I don't give a shmit.

[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:47.520]
That's my vote.

[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:47.980]
I don't.

[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.700]
Doesn't surprise me.

[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.220]
South Dakota, by the way, is very close.

[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.580]
It's with like 100 and some votes.

[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.000]
The Senate raised in South Dakota.

[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.480]
Time dashes.

[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.740]
I'm trying to find some dead people.

[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.800]
Not too easy to make up votes in South Dakota.

[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.080]
Because when there's only like 80 people living a whole state

[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:02.720]
in the first place,

[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.800]
it's kind of like is conspicuous.

[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.200]
You know, when they start bringing in some ringers.

[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.700]
Unlike in this day, where we got like millions and millions.

[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.660]
And some of them actually are like citizens, you know?

[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.580]
Some of them actually alive and are still voting.

[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.000]
Well, you know, it's time to get it on.

[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.660]
WQ I am.

[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.420]
Yeah, on a national level, the Democrats

[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.420]
moved because of the partisan politics.

[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.640]
They don't want to get anything through.

[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.480]
They don't even want to put the budget through.

[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.540]
So I think they kind of hose themselves a little bit on that.

[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.300]
Yeah.

[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.480]
But that's the way it is, I guess.

[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.480]
That's the way it is.

[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.220]
And we have, I love you George Bush.

[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:34.780]
I love you.

[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:35.620]
George Bush.

[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.420]
This guy loves Bush.

[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:39.160]
Bush, Bush.

[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.360]
You got all the butch you can handle, man.

[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.920]
In your case, it also I like too much.

[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.080]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.500]
I see I'm running these beads.

[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.080]
That's bad.

[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.680]
Why did I take these out of that package?

[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.920]
I don't even love beads.

[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.700]
I think we can have this so cold.

[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:51.900]
I'm going out.

[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.700]
Oh my God.

[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.940]
It's a good thing I didn't like pull the string on these when I was standing there.

[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:01.840]
I think that would have been the end.

[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.660]
I think that that piece would have flipped right off his head.

[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:05.500]
Come on, Mo.

[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.780]
Just lighten up a little bit.

[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.200]
It's quit being such a hard ass.

[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.040]
God.

[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.620]
Up until this moment, I never quite realized just the degree,

[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.940]
the extent of psychosis and paranoia.

[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.360]
Up until this moment, till you actually witness it yourself.

[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.600]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:23.800]
John Bob.

[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.200]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.200]
Hello.

[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.180]
Nobody on 7?

[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:34.460]
I think it's the quiet guy.

[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.340]
Oh, the quiet guy.

[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.600]
And Rick Sanchez, also I'm as was ripping for the fact he was in the newsroom

[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.080]
with his sleeves all rolled up until somebody told him MSNBC made him do that.

[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.760]
But he said, boy, look like a jerk.

[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.480]
And I was thinking to myself, well, even with the sleeves rolled back down,

[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.880]
he still would look like a jerk being in there.

[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.880]
I mean, who the hell's Rick Sanchez?

[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.020]
What credibility has he got to be covered in an election?

[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.340]
You know, Rick Sanchez.

[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.900]
But the fixes in it, I don't mean fixed in terms of fixing the actual outcome,

[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.740]
but it's the deal is sealed.

[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.260]
And now we'll see what happens.

[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.540]
Now we'll see what kind of right-wing paranoian crap passes

[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.140]
for our government in this country.

[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.960]
And I'll say it again, we got nobody to blame but the Democrats.

[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.340]
Don't blame the Republicans.

[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.560]
They just went out there and did the best thing they could.

[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.640]
Grease as many palms as they could.

[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.780]
The Republicans didn't grease as many, raise enough money and they campaigned like crap.

[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.060]
That's what it boils down to.

[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.700]
All my Democratic friends out there, Altenia,

[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.720]
got nobody to blame but yourselves because they stunk.

[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.060]
They stunk the joint out.

[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.800]
And that guy that faxed me yesterday.

[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.720]
Remember at the beginning of the show,

[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.460]
oh Bill McBride's two points ahead.

[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.820]
Right, right.

[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.060]
Oh, it's a matter of fact, I think he won, didn't he?

[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:43.820]
He won Broward?

[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:49.020]
Not by as much as people thought but he won Broward but not too much.

[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.480]
Always, Immick Brides made and never Immick Bride.

[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.560]
27 after 9 at 560 WQA.

[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.440]
I'm let's face it, you've been hearing about fast rain for a long time.

[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.680]
Let's see if it makes sense for you.

[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.680]
You finger it out.

[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.740]
The facts are simple, if you have the dedication fast rain can provide you

[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.160]
with the necessary training to become a certified computer professional.

[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.260]
According to prestigious Time magazine and they know they're crap at time.

[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.680]
The demand for computer professionals will continue to get bigger and bigger and just explode,

[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.180]
like Moe just about did this morning.

[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.100]
The average student completes their training in four short months attending school three nights a week.

[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.040]
Once you've completed your certification fast rain can help you in obtaining

[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.400]
your new computer job and making some serious bucks.

[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.060]
And by the way, George, you ever look at a mirror and see how sloppy you dress?

[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:32.860]
Yeah, all the time.

[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:36.540]
Fast rain invites you to come and visit their train career counselor and determine which

[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.160]
track is ideal for you.

[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.240]
It might be what's that other track?

[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.860]
He's at Liberty Bell, another out of business track in Philadelphia.

[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.820]
Call fast rain 1-866 fast rain to set up an appointment.

[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.200]
They've got four convenient locations.

[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.540]
You'll find one near you.

[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.820]
I'm almost sure that they're in Miami.

[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.220]
Pemberpines for Lauderdale and now Kendall.

[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.500]
So there's got to be like I said one near where you live.

[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.820]
Don't forget to ask the career counselor for list of students just like yourself

[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.280]
who are currently in their dream jobs.

[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.340]
Call fast train at their toll free number 1-866 fast train.

[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:09.000]
That's 1-866 fast train or check them out on the web at fastrain.com.

[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:14.660]
You can be working in that new job before spring but you've got to make that call 1-866 fast train.

[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.960]
Is a butt- I smell it?

[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:25.680]
Uh oh.

[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.060]

To the bitch.

[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:16.440]
Uh huh.

[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.400]

Hi, 33 at 560 W.C.M.

[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.620]
You know what the Iman says?

[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.940]
Don't Iman says the people at Fox ought to be wearing sheets.

[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:56.860]
Maybe they're...

[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.040]
This is just a stupid.

[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.360]
Yeah, it could be.

[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.300]
I don't like that.

[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.060]
By the way, that drop in it's...

[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.320]
This is just a stupid.

[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.220]
Just a stupid.

[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.600]
I don't like that crowd noise in the back.

[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:07.880]
Well, it's from the game.

[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:08.860]
Don't like it.

[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.440]

I'm ready to leave the country god damn it.

[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.980]
Point me in the right direction.

[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:16.540]

Yeah, I'm quote...

I'm ecstatic 16.

[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.400]
I'm suicidal 11.

[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.440]
I don't give a shmit 10.

[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.580]
That's a way to look at it.

[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.140]
Just be oblivious.

[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:30.900]

Executed.

[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.860]
They want a national energy park.

[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:34.420]
Yeah, they want this.

[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:34.940]
They want that.

[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:35.940]
I got news for it.

[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.600]
Issues had nothing to do with this election.

[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.000]
Nothing.

[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:39.660]
Absolutely nothing.

[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.440]
It was a goose stepping election.

[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:43.400]
That's right.

[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:43.900]
We're in war.

[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:44.780]
We're always going to be in war.

[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.260]
Therefore we have to like a goose step

[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.480]
behind our commander in chief,

[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.520]
our leader, our head said,

[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.020]
whatever it was so on.

[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:49.680]
And that's it.

[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.520]
That's all I was all about.

[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.440]
Plus the Democrats suck.

[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.020]
Everybody knows that now.

[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:53.480]
They suck.

[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.500]
Geb Hart was honest morning.

[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.260]
Man, I'll tell you.

[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.340]
It's a good thing his name is Dick,

[00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.140]
because he sure is.

[00:26:59.220 --> 00:26:59.440]
What up?

[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.100]
Between him and Tom Dashel,

[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:01.780]
I got to collect him.

[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.780]
Joseph Ganky looks like a Mexican jumping

[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.760]
being compared to those two.

[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.120]
Boring, bland, spineless, gutless.

[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:11.760]
Follow what I'm saying?

[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:12.940]
What are you saying?

[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.620]
I'm saying the Democrats lack leadership.

[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.380]
They lack charisma.

[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.080]
They lack excitement.

[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.120]
They lack platform.

[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.280]
They lack, they lack lustre.

[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.360]
That's exactly right.

[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.220]
Remember Mr. Custer?

[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.480]
They lack lustre.

[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.880]
I'd like some custard right now.

[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.140]
Some frozen almond fudge.

[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.120]
That does sound good.

[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.080]
From Don and Bob's.

[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.560]
Five, we're not getting any food in here.

[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.360]
I don't want to be eating.

[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.900]
Because if I don't quit eating until I get out of this place,

[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.200]
I'm going to like gain all that weight back

[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:36.700]
that I lost.

[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:37.840]
Remember how good I was doing there?

[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:38.180]
Right.

[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.020]
Now this is an eating place.

[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.260]
This is a goddamn food place.

[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.580]
It's a food pushing place.

[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.340]
I want out.

[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.460]
I want out of this place.

[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.360]
It's a food pushing place.

[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.800]
And then I can get out of my hair.

[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:48.420]
Oh, sorry.

[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.880]
Now seriously, I might have to do

[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.360]
though and luckily it's Wednesday.

[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.300]
We got the new and the one Wednesday comedy bit hour.

[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.420]
Thank the Lord for that.

[00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:58.920]
Thank you.

[00:27:59.300 --> 00:27:59.420]
Good.

[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.700]
Because I don't want to sit here and have to do

[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.680]
four solid hours of, and it's totally off the wall.

[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.880]
I thought we're going to sit here

[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.440]
and reminisce about the election yesterday.

[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:08.860]
Remember this about when we had a free country,

[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.660]
at least to some degree.

[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.120]
I'd like Monday.

[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.380]
But all of a sudden this guy,

[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.720]
and that guy that called you,

[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.540]
and O'Shaun Prabhakatura, whoever made that call.

[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.620]
But we were glad that we got it.

[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.120]
W-Q-I-N.

[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.040]
Hello.

[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.280]
Yes, sir?

[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:26.840]
Okay.

[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.060]
Jeff Bush broke the law last night at 630 at my house.

[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:33.620]
Yeah.

[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:38.380]
He made a solicitation call,

[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.740]
and he did not allow...

[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:43.320]
Okay, good.

[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.720]
They did not allow...

[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.400]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.180]
And I think that was time, Dashal.

[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.500]
Wouldn't it sound like time a little bit?

[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.240]
Don't take it that hard time.

[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.400]
It's only an election, okay?

[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.580]
It's only our democracy.

[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:57.720]
It's only the Constitution.

[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.860]
It's all of our freedoms.

[00:28:59.060 --> 00:28:59.600]
That's all it is.

[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.340]
Don't worry about it.

[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.180]
Just a guy with demolition.

[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.820]
America, these things aren't very important.

[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.320]
We had important stuff like ball games to worry about.

[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.120]
Now we're talking big hockey game tonight.

[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.060]
Marios coming to town.

[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.280]
Let's look on the bright side.

[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.600]
Leafs pulled one out of their ass.

[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.120]
Back to him.

[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.600]
Beatample last night, 4 to 3.

[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.920]
Alexander Mogilny, the hat trick.

[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:15.800]
Nice going, Ermo.

[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.380]
Alexander Mogilny.

[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.180]
Now you think if I call him Moe, he'd be upset.

[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:19.840]
I don't think so.

[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.680]
He might he might he might spear me a little bit,

[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.320]
but other than that,

[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.500]
love that Alexander Mogilny.

[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:25.820]
He demand.

[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.340]
So it was long ago that all those good things.

[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.060]
Let's concentrate.

[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.080]
Like Harvey Ruvon once told me when he was a Metro commissioner.

[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.280]
When during the Mirriela crisis,

[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.160]
when all the people were getting murdered all over town,

[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.140]
and when this place was like a toilet in Dave County,

[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:38.980]
even worth a now.

[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.440]
And I got him on my show and he says,

[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.060]
oh, no, let's not discuss all of those things.

[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.120]
Let's talk about the good things that are happening in Dave County.

[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.240]
Let's talk about the people that haven't got murdered yet.

[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.220]
Kind of like that, you know.

[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.120]
So let's look on the bright side like Monty Python would say.

[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.300]
Instead of being a bunch of sour pie all the time,

[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.340]
like some people around here.

[00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:58.340]
WQAM.

[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.120]
Get ready for the cyclone B2, boy.

[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.040]
No, boy.

[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.540]
Good one.

[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.480]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.520]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.280]
WQAM.

[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.320]
Hello.

[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:10.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:11.700]
Neil.

[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:12.160]
Yes.

[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:18.540]
First of all, let me tell you your speech or your buddy speech on Monday

[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.300]
didn't help out the half cent tax down here.

[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.960]
So we're going to end up building that metro rail to Disney World.

[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.720]
No, because you mean Richard Friedman,

[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.780]
well, first of all, they never heard him get to the point

[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.100]
because after about the first 30 seconds, they were on a coma.

[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.680]
You know, he's a good guy, but they, you know,

[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:33.720]
puts everywhere to sleep.

[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.400]
Well, I think it's what is it?

[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:36.940]
188 miles we're going to build?

[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:38.200]
I don't know.

[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.340]
I have no, I don't know.

[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.360]
I don't, I don't consider myself with those things anymore.

[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:46.080]
And another thing is now that you're, now that you're going to make up with this character.

[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.880]
Well, wait, wait, I didn't say I'm making up with anybody.

[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.740]
I said, I was the one muffin.

[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.960]
I discussed and then Clarence thought it was a good idea.

[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.440]
Have a meeting kind of clear the air, me and George and Moe and them and Greg and,

[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.240]
you know, at a place where all we'd be safe like Lewis and the Bronx, you know, like that.

[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.280]
And sit, sit down and discuss, you know, air it out.

[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.640]
Because, you know, how can you possibly work together in an environment like this

[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.480]
where somebody is taking it also personal?

[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.120]
I mean, this is business and this man is taking it personal.

[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.400]
Oh, just in case, don't drink the coffee in the office.

[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.380]
And are you going to stop playing the skits?

[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:19.160]
Am I what?

[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.860]
Are you going to stop playing the skits?

[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:21.600]
No chance.

[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.240]
No great job.

[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.400]
Okay, have a great day.

[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.960]
Well, I'm not going to stop playing.

[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.760]
I said, you know what this reminds me of?

[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.900]
It's kind of like a non-political or a non-ethnic

[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.880]
Heather thing from Fox, where they try to make the big simmiss about,

[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.420]
oh, you're a racist because you're playing Kiss and Nigger good morning

[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.740]
and you're playing Condoleez and that stuff.

[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.340]
Uh, we're not racist anymore.

[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:44.920]
I am a racist, but like an average ordinary racist is supposed to like a virulent black hating

[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.140]
racist that calls people nigger stuff like that.

[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.580]
I don't do that.

[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.220]
Well, he's not in public.

[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:52.880]
I use that word.

[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:53.940]
No, I really don't.

[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.000]
Like if I'm in a drug...

[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.220]
I use it with great love with that seat.

[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:56.900]
No, I don't.

[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:57.780]
Like if I'm driving...

[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.320]
driving on a car and some black person is driving very, very badly,

[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.880]
I'll be screaming after they can hear me, which is a good thing.

[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.680]
But I'll be screaming, what's wrong with you crazy spook?

[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.080]
And there's nothing virulent meant by that.

[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.560]
It's just, uh, you know, just me being me, you know.

[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.540]
It'll say, what up, Mnigger?

[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.640]
Or like, or like if I'm old, brought, I talked about in the Cadillac day

[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.920]
with her Juke Nu, I'm screaming, you crazy old bitch!

[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.140]
Well, what does that guy do with anything?

[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:20.820]
Pointer reference.

[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.320]
But anyway, so it's, to me, I see it as the same way.

[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.160]
The bits that we're playing about him are no different than ones we play about me

[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.460]
or you or Josh Friedman or Fat Boy.

[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.400]
Ever have Fat Boy complain about this stuff?

[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.120]
They love it!

[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.280]
They love the attention!

[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.920]
He lost so hard, he might die.

[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:35.360]
Who? Fat Boy?

[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.000]
Oh, please.

[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.640]
Even if he don't laugh, he might die.

[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:39.600]
Let's, how's he doing?

[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:40.560]
Haven't seen him recently.

[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:41.800]
He's on the Walker?

[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:43.600]
Yeah.

[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.060]
He's on the Walker.

[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.720]
Of course, when you're on the Walker, it's hard to balance that ham sandwich,

[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.400]
you know, unless you've got one free hand.

[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.280]
And he's got one of the...

[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.300]
He's got one of the walkers that you're only holding the middle with one hand.

[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.980]
His Walker has a TV tray attachment.

[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:00.660]
Oh, man.

[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:01.860]
Poor Fat Boy.

[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.600]
We're pulling for you, Fat Boy.

[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.400]
You move way up and top it listed our, as far as this sales crowd.

[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.060]
Well, guess what I saw him taking the leak yesterday at the end of work?

[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:09.780]
Skippy.

[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.540]
Like that, he had no idea what that.

[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.620]
He doesn't know what plan he's on at, kid.

[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:16.440]
Skippy.

[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.080]
That's our sales crew for you, okay?

[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.000]
We got Adam, who's a good guy.

[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.420]
He comes in every morning, he's kind of boring, but a very good guy.

[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.120]
boring.

[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:27.120]
And then PD Lenny, that if we never saw him again, it would be much too soon.

[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.620]
Crazy person, certifiable.

[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:29.920]
Needs to be in a rubber room.

[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.160]
I need post-counter billboard.

[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.040]
Need post-counter billboard.

[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:32.660]
Where's your billboard?

[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:33.580]
Need post-counter billboard.

[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.180]
What kind of a place?

[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.060]
Hey, go find out what flavors I want, okay?

[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.980]
PD, go find out which flavors I'm getting.

[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:42.580]
Crazy person.

[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.460]
Anyway, no, we're not going to stop.

[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.960]
But the near-rodger show will continue being the near-rodger show.

[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:51.800]
And whether it's Heather or Moe or anybody else that don't have a sense of human eye,

[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:52.920]
that's not my fault.

[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.700]
That's not my problem, that's not my fault.

[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.760]
Sooner or later, you've got a light-nub a little bit, you know?

[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:02.500]
If we could all light-nub and look like Shamar Moe and the Heather Berry, Heather Lockhart.

[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.460]
Howdy-bear, did I say Heather Berry Lockhart?

[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:05.920]
Howdy-howdy-lockhart.

[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.740]
Well, I'm a little old and June Lockhart.

[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.660]
See, you put that in my mind because you mentioned me yesterday.

[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:10.340]
That's the Boston State.

[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.200]
When what's his name died?

[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.440]
Jonathan Harris.

[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.900]
Jonathan Harris, Rest in Peace.

[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:14.740]
He will be missed.

[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:15.840]
He will be missed.

[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:16.440]
He was great.

[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.340]
Just like Richard Harris will be missed, but not so much because we

[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.400]
heard from him too much lately.

[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.960]
19 till 10 at 560 WQM.

[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:25.580]
On a great Wednesday, don't forget noon to one.

[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:26.380]
It's all comedy bits.

[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.920]
And maybe today, what do you think?

[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.880]
Should we suspend playing any of those that are between noon to one?

[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:31.320]
No.

[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.840]
Hey, you know, we all have different needs because everybody's health is different.

[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.460]
Your body is different.

[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.260]
And that's why like sometimes you take antibiotics that are good for some people.

[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.120]
And some other people are allergic to them,

[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.100]
practically die from.

[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.560]
Well, the same is true with supplements.

[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.940]
All of you mediterranean formulas are advanced combinations of pharmaceutical

[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.580]
and suburbanate olive oil with vitamins, minerals,

[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.260]
herbals, other nutrients, specifically designed for different people.

[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.880]
Maybe you need some help with your blood pressure.

[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.480]
Maybe some other people need help with their mind, whatever.

[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.620]
And of course, they also have three new formulas.

[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.620]
One to help you sleep, one to help you control your weight,

[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.540]
and coque you, 10, which for my money is one of the best things for your heart you could ever take.

[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.860]
All of these products, using the benefits of the finest and purest olive oil

[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.040]
that money can buy.

[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.920]
I can just see all those little Italians stomping the olives with their feed.

[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.520]
It's fantastic.

[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.480]

This is sports when you're fighting.

[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.640]
You way up.

[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.960]
The bad date is quitsnith and glued.

[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.340]
Santana, you've heard him play his Grammy performance with Rob Thomas.

[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.100]
And on the latest hit with Michelle Branch.

[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.320]
Everybody wants Santana on their song.

[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.880]
So we've compiled a CE collection of every artist Santana has ever played with.

[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.420]
Like M&M.

[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.840]
Two straight apart girls all around the outside.

[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.000]
Round the outside.

[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.020]
Round the outside.

[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.640]
The Dixie Chicks.

[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.960]
Andrea Bacheli.

[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.900]
It's Santana's looks for everyone CD including unreleased tracks from Carlos and

[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.580]
John Tess.

[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.280]
But someday your journey will end.

[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.160]
I'll be there for you as well.

[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.740]
Yes, because if it's our plane,

[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.280]
horror who will play with anybody.

[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.700]
Except of course, Kelly Clarkson.

[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:16.940]
No way man.

[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.700]

Happy breath day, dear Santana.

[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:30.760]
Call now.

[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.180]
Hey Santana, lick this.

[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.100]
After that smooth thing, man, it just turned me off.

[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.820]
You know, they were playing it like every 14 seconds.

[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.920]
That thing just was the biggest piece of crap.

[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:40.880]
If that would have been like,

[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.360]
I'm a Schmendrich down the street who would have done that.

[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.960]
Nobody would have ever even heard of it.

[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:45.680]
Much less played it.

[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.500]
But that's just one of them things.

[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.880]
169 votes on the pool.

[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.940]
What's your take on yesterday's lecture results?

[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.180]
The Republican sweeping.

[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.980]
Even Bobby Butterworth got beat.

[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.520]
Which may be not be all that bad.

[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.380]
Even Charlie Jesus Christ one is attorney general.

[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.160]
Do you want to want to bring back the chain gangs?

[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.640]
Let's get Sam Cook to sing the Working on the Chain Gang.

[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:04.740]
Yeah.

[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:08.860]
Oh man, what a place.

[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.060]
That's what you got to laugh.

[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.520]
You might as well laugh.

[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:12.980]
See, it's one thing about me.

[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:13.980]
I got a good sense of humor.

[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.400]
Some people I don't have any sense of humor.

[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.000]
And of course, it doesn't serve them well.

[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:19.540]
It does not serve them well.

[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.160]
169 votes.

[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.680]
I'm ready to leave the country 55.

[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:23.920]
They're all a bunch of crooks.

[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.060]
Which I think is the right answer.

[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.380]
By the way, they're all a bunch of crooks.

[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:27.940]
So what difference does it make?

[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:28.860]
Not Ralph Nader.

[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.120]
Now, he's too much of a schmuck to be a crook.

[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.520]
They're all a bunch of crooks 48.

[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.180]
I'm ecstatic 27.

[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.680]
I'm suicidal 24 and I'll give a schmit 15.

[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.840]
Let's see, I'm ecstatic 27.

[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:43.620]
I'm suicidal 24.

[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.560]
So that's just about like evens itself out.

[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:49.080]
I don't hear the sound of too many bodies dropping from the top floors.

[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.700]
You know, on the ground, people jumping off with tall buildings.

[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.080]
How is the market doing today?

[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.780]
Now, wouldn't you think the market would again continue

[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.020]
going zooming up after this tremendous Republican sweep?

[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.400]
Come on, you gray robbers.

[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.840]
I don't want to see no spider, man.

[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.660]
I want to see the goddamn numbers on there.

[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:05.440]
Jesus.

[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.320]
Buh, buh, buh.

[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.820]
When you think instead, oh, here you go.

[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.500]
That was up six.

[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.820]
I'm not very exciting, you know.

[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.260]
After they goasted way up the last few days,

[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.260]
now on an Azdaqs actually down fractually,

[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.060]
like almost the point.

[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.380]
Not nothing very exciting there.

[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.340]
You would have thought,

[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.060]
because it wasn't at midchhurst that told me back in 2000

[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.380]
that the market's wanted bush,

[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.560]
butch, butch, butch, and then it was going to go way up.

[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.880]
Just one more example of his being full of crap.

[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.160]
Thanks a lot, Mitch.

[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.480]
And by the way,

[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.200]
$250.

[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:31.960]
WQAM.

[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.540]
Yeah, I went to the polls.

[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.100]
No, okay.

[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:36.440]
WQAM.

[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:37.420]
Neil.

[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:42.300]
Hey, think you might be able to play that call from the first team

[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.340]
where the guy asked about the surgeon and his two pay.

[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.380]
From the first team?

[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.620]
Well, whatever the morning show,

[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.940]
whatever the thing where the guy was talking to Mo

[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.320]
asking if the guy that did his two pay

[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.100]
was the same surgeon that did pump it out.

[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:57.600]
Yeah.

[00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.460]
Would think you might be able to play that.

[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.980]
You mean the doctor thing about Jay Feedler's the surgeon?

[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.320]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:08.580]
You mean the one that goes in the doctor that performed the surgery on Jay Feedler's thumb?

[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:09.120]
Mm-hmm.

[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:12.940]
Isn't he the same doctor that performed the procedure on your QP?

[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:16.860]
Um,

[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.840]
the doctor who performed the surgery,

[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.300]
let's think about that.

[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:22.760]
What's his name?

[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:23.320]
Client?

[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.340]
Feedler's doctor?

[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:25.720]
Yeah.

[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.980]
I don't know who I don't know who he used.

[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:28.960]
He used George Colwell?

[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:29.960]
I'm not sure.

[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.920]
I'm not sure where he went.

[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.340]
I'm not sure where he went.

[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:33.540]
I'm not sure where he went.

[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:34.200]
Did he go to Holy Cross?

[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.140]
I didn't read it.

[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:36.700]
Not sure.

[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.300]
Well, bottom line is that the doctors can't tell how long Jay's going to be out.

[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.280]
No, you're not sure.

[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.700]
Somewhere at least a month could be up to eight weeks.

[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:45.180]
Somewhere in there.

[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.500]
Wally on the wall with your own QAM.

[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:47.320]
Hi Mo.

[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.440]
I'm sorry, I'm not Wally.

[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.500]
Uh, you know, you can't be so vain.

[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.020]
We're talking about Carly Simon,

[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.840]
that's how you can't be so vain when you're old and you're in a bad hair piece.

[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.400]
I mean, look, let's face it,

[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.180]
none of us are like fashion plates in this place.

[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:04.240]
We don't have other than Miguel and the name of a female in this building.

[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.060]
It's really great looking.

[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:06.220]
Carly.

[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.200]
Carolan.

[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.540]
Um, you better watch yourself, Mr.

[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:11.500]
I watch myself.

[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.500]
But yeah, you better take a look at the mirror before you leave a house in the morning.

[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:18.280]
But anyway, but other than that, we don't have like a lot of really beautiful people in this building.

[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.840]
People need to say, oh, look at that.

[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.680]
There's like a real beautiful hot person.

[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:22.900]
There's a real like fashion plate.

[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.820]
Most of the people come here dressed like slabs like we are today because

[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.420]
why it's a radio with television.

[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.020]
We're not telling.

[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.940]
We're not making some kind of a appearance.

[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.860]
We're not going out in sales like fat boy and having to put out a good appearance.

[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.100]
Or like PD Lenny, the the shovel PD Lenny, who looks like he just crawled from out of a dumpster.

[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.160]
I'll tell you one thing about PD man.

[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.720]
He sure is he is.

[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.620]
He makes me look like a snappy dresser and that's almost impossible.

[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.800]
Seriously, he is just I think he's going for comedy.

[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.540]
You think he sleeps in that crap or what?

[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:51.480]
He must.

[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:57.440]
So how can you possibly be vain when you get advanced in years when you get to be an old fart?

[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.900]
How can you be vain about your age and about all these things?

[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.340]
Just lighten up a little bit.

[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.320]
It's just a radio show.

[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:03.420]
It's a means to an end.

[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.800]
We're not going to change the world here.

[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:10.320]
Talking about some stupid ball game and about Ray Lucas did this and George Lucas said that and

[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:12.380]
Jerry Lucas did this.

[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.220]
Who cares?

[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.020]
You know, we're just trying to fumble our way through lives and do the best we can.

[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:17.900]
That's my motto.

[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:19.440]
Do the best you can.

[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.040]
Under very trying the circumstances.

[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.540]
But we just have a situation here and I don't know if you can change when you get to be at that

[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.180]
advanced stage.

[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.200]
You think it's possible for people to change and say no.

[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.700]
Well, you know something maybe you've got a point.

[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.580]
Now that I understand where you're really coming from because some people don't want to understand

[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:36.340]
where I'm coming from.

[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.100]
That's what bugs me.

[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:38.420]
Like Heather, she was a good example.

[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:43.160]
She started with an agenda and the agenda was to prove the point that I'm a virulent racist

[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.960]
and that liberals are all really racist and we're not going to help out the black folks

[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.140]
and you black folks stay home which in Broward, at least a lot of them did.

[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.300]
And everybody else too.

[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.060]
Nice job you folks in the media.

[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.580]
By the way, warning everybody there'd be a two or three hour wait to vote yesterday.

[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:56.360]
I'll say it again.

[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.240]
What's going to make any difference?

[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.500]
It's not an excuse, but it's just an inexcusable to be doing that.

[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.780]
Because you scared a lot of people away.

[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:04.920]
But at least we can say, look at this.

[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.000]
We're on blimmers today.

[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:10.540]
Florida didn't have any more embarrassments except who we elected governor and attorney general.

[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.140]
WQ I am.

[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.420]
Hey, Neil.

[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:18.100]
First of all, I want to say congratulations to you on what?

[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:22.080]
For having me tell them to the financial situation to get out of this country.

[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.280]
You're a very lucky person.

[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:24.900]
Yes, I am.

[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:28.500]
Second, um, we're on the growing up now these years.

[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.340]
I used to hear this slogan.

[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.960]
You never talk politics and religions at a bar.

[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:37.840]
And now I've become to realize that these two cops have so much similarities.

[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:38.400]
Unbelievable.

[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:44.900]
It's like people are just following people and you know, not even taking consideration.

[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.100]
Because you're a Republican.

[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:47.140]
You got to vote Republican.

[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.920]
Okay, even though he might be the right person for the job,

[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.860]
they are automatically vote for what their party is and not the right person.

[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:57.660]
And I'll put this really shows how ignorant and stupid this country is getting.

[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.900]
You should vote for the person that you think will do the best for your state.

[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:01.760]
Well, guess what?

[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:02.440]
Guess what?

[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.840]
Maybe there ain't no person who's going to do the best for our state.

[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:05.520]
How do you like that?

[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.160]
You're probably right about that.

[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:07.420]
Okay.

[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:08.820]
Just calm down a little bit.

[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.560]
Take a couple and call us some other day.

[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.260]
That's right.

[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:11.620]
See you.

[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:12.400]
Get out of here.

[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.540]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.760]
And by the way, that Jamaican guy, what else is his name?

[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.160]
That calls him over every morning.

[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.060]
I, he may still be listening to that.

[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:24.660]
And what the hell?

[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.820]
And I don't want to start interfering with that show because then I'll get some more crap thrown at me.

[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.340]
But I wish he'd call it other times than when I'm on my way to work.

[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:33.000]
Because he's interfering with my enjoyment of the Mojo.

[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:34.840]
Jer...

[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.020]
What the hell is his name?

[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.480]
Jerky, the Jamaican or Jamaican jerk chicken or whatever.

[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:39.640]
I don't know what his name is.

[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.620]
Every day I'm coming to work there he is.

[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:42.620]
There is the fish.

[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:43.380]
You know?

[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:44.900]
Let's get some new blood on here.

[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.060]
Let's get Moa number this month.

[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.240]
Maybe that'll make him feel better.

[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.840]
So maybe if it wasn't the beast fault, maybe it was my fault.

[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.120]
The number wasn't much much bigger.

[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:52.780]
I think that's it.

[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:54.200]
You're fired.

[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:55.820]
W-Q-I-N.

[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.640]
Yeah, okay.

[00:44:58.780 --> 00:44:59.000]
Good one.

[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:00.540]
W-Q-I-N.

[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:01.740]
Hello, Neil.

[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:02.260]
Yes?

[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:03.120]
Hey, what's up?

[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:03.460]
It's Phil.

[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:03.880]
How you doing?

[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:04.560]
Phil?

[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:05.120]
Yeah.

[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:06.140]
Did you like my card?

[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.240]
Oh yeah.

[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.520]
Good, good.

[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:08.820]
Yeah.

[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:09.360]
I hope you need a lens.

[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:09.640]

[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:09.920]
Why?

[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.680]
We're starting to get our own chronics now.

[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.520]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:12.860]
You know what?

[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.060]
Um, hey, did George give you the other pictures I sent you a while back?

[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:16.780]
I don't know.

[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:17.200]
He got them.

[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:17.760]
I don't know Phil.

[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:18.760]
Not interested in your pictures.

[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.300]
Don't take it personal, but I'm not interested.

[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.000]
Okay, no problem.

[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.500]
Hey, listen, I voted blue yesterday,

[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.000]
even though I knew we had no chance.

[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:24.320]
Right.

[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.100]
I still a wonder for it's my opinion.

[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.480]
Well, blue is the word being from

[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:28.600]
Reloves and Amsterdam.

[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.160]
I say I guess blue would be the word.

[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.240]
Yeah, blue for demo.

[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:31.800]
Blue this.

[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:32.420]
Uh-huh.

[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.200]
Anyways, as far as the poll, I'm suicidal and I'm living the country.

[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:36.660]
Okay.

[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.700]
Yeah, number two, Boka Bryant is a genius.

[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:43.000]
The Heather Song and the one you played yesterday,

[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.260]
I'm embarrassed to be an American.

[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:46.280]
Ha, that's really great.

[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.580]
Oh, and another thing about Boka.

[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.000]
Not like he's paying me to do this, but uh-

[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.180]
True.

[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:57.360]
Yeah, um, yeah, I got an autographed copy of his CD and it's great.

[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.360]
Okay, Phil.

[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:00.720]
In closing, Neil.

[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:01.280]
Yes.

[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:02.800]
Will you speak my monkey?

[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:03.660]
Toad scenes.

[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:04.860]
Toad scenes, do we?

[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.920]
Let's see if most of this marketplace one more time,

[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.340]
I will stop listening to a show, man.

[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:11.320]
Says Arnaldo.

[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.180]
Arnaldo in uh-

[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.000]
in Miami says I will stop listening.

[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.900]
He says marketplace one more time.

[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.660]
I never- never- never noticed that, but I'll start looking for it.

[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:21.980]
What's that you're making, guys name?

[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:23.660]
Bumbaclott.

[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:24.940]
No, no, Sam Sirius.

[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.200]
I mean, I don't know what you ought to be knowing your monitoring that's you every day.

[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:34.160]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.500]
What's on the agenda today?

[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.320]
By the- it seems to me, by the way, since I'm accused of trying to undermine that show,

[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:43.520]
which is a lie, that it was the mad dog a couple of months ago who somebody asked him,

[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.020]
or maybe even on solicit, it said,

[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.800]
that's a bad show, referring to our morning show.

[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:49.540]
It's a New York show, two New York guys.

[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.220]
All they talk about is New York teams.

[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:52.080]
It's a New York show.

[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:52.880]
It's a bad show.

[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.600]
Now, maybe he's changed his mind on that.

[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:55.120]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:55.640]
The mad dog.

[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.460]
He's entitled to do that.

[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.980]
But he's the one that said that we're all entitled to give our opinions.

[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.600]
If somebody wants to come on and say this show is a show for morons or trained monkeys or whatever,

[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.980]
I have no problem with that.

[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:05.020]
Okay?

[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.820]
Anyway, what kind of he worked up about that?

[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.580]
Oh, because mad dogs on a schedule.

[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:10.340]
They're one to three.

[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.800]
And also, by the way, Mr. Mad Dog, I'm going to start on him.

[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:17.400]
Michigan State isn't interested in being a football power.

[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:17.980]
We don't care.

[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.900]
We got a lot of potheads and co-heads.

[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:21.600]
We don't care.

[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.620]
He was going on yesterday about, boy, if there's ever a sleeping giant

[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:28.340]
in a place that really could be the next big powerhouse if they were going to get the right person in there,

[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.300]
maybe we got more important things at Michigan State to worry about.

[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:35.260]
Like, you know, like learning something and getting expelled from school.

[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:35.880]
And getting drunk.

[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:36.800]
Things like that.

[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:37.420]
Getting laid.

[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.420]
As opposed to Michigan and Penn State.

[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:42.720]
And you know, you have them.

[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.020]
The same half doesn't, you know, football, professional jock-stiffing schools.

[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:50.700]
Anyway, Jim Maddich won Hank Olberg a three with Ira Winderman between four and five

[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.420]
Kila great hour.

[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.960]
Then we got the shittko panther preview between seven and seven thirty seven thirty panthers

[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.340]
in a penguins Mario's in town.

[00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:00.460]
Eddie K. after the hockey game from GA and Joel and Mark overnight.

[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.340]
My mind and local.

[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.100]
Here's sports radio 560 healing.

[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.300]
UAM.

[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.580]
For David's the bitch.

[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:14.400]
And now the League of Retarded Citizens will perform their edition of Greenery and dirt.

[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.340]
Don't make fun.

[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.340]
They were very hard for this.

[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:59.000]
Dum Dum D Mmm Is Die Commander in the Dead House.

one of the very few people predicted it was going to be a republican sweep i

[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:19.160]
predicted that right here on a show

[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.920]
you could feel it you could smell it you could smell the stench of the feet

[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.500]
coming from the

[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:29.080]
imputed democratic party who always when push comes to show they always seem to

[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:33.140]
be right there to let us down and they do they never disappoint they always

[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:38.400]
let you down and it's not going to make a big difference anyway because the

[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.320]
all directed toward me so he didn't see them rolling around in the chair

[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.420]

mo for you money the mo we plan the mo they listen here's the facts from

[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:55.540]
gary who says good morning sir your birthday to fall in a connoir conversion

[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:59.420]
to weight theocracy see i had a fine birthday i have no problem with uh you

[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:02.200]
know i wasn't really excited about the turnout but that's what i expected

[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.280]
could you explain how the morons in the state could vote for an amendment that

[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.420]
reduces class sizes and for a toughster's got the biggest plans to undo it

[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:12.500]
well they don't care see see that's the deal the people go out there and they say well

[00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.500]
i'll pretend i really care about education which they don't

[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:18.520]
if the people in the state ever cared about education we wouldn't be like

[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:21.820]
sucking wind and right down there with Mississippi is the last and next to

[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:25.360]
last in every category they never cared about it and they don't care about it

[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.560]
now but it just sounds good it's definitely politically correct to say

[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:33.300]
oh our number one issue is education right give me a break

[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.380]
so they vote for it and then of course they know it's not going to happen because

[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.900]
he's going to make them sure it doesn't happen and the kids will be still

[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.500]
going to school in portapoddies and uh you know all these other places with no

[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.900]
air conditioning in the summertime it'll be great just like it always has been

[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.200]
which is another reason why nobody under the age of a hundred ought to be living

[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.980]
here because people are at an over the age of a hundred don't have little kids

[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.040]
going to school and we could just close down all the schools

[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:59.360]
close down the schools and build more schools bring some more old Jews down

[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.780]
right right on

[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.020]
five six seven i'm just you know i'm not going to get all whipped up to a

[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:10.360]
frenzy about it i'm not i've got good article here by Thomas Frieden and the

[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:12.960]
American idol about Bill Clinton and the Germans and the way they admire him

[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.000]
and the reasons why i'll save it i think for tomorrow

[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.920]
Gord Vidal says oil thirst behind bush policies but i'll save that for

[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:22.680]
tomorrow also because today i just want to sit here and yank on my

[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:22.920]
um

[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.700]
in love beads

[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:28.940]
yank on my beads those are the biggest beads i ever saw the way

[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:31.060]
well we got a lot of people around here with a big

[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.800]
rectum okay so maybe that's the reason

[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:35.020]
WQIM

[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.100]
hello yes sir

[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.480]
Neil yes

[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:42.180]
hello to both you and George always a pleasure to listen to you guys

[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:45.180]
a couple comments on our fantastic collection

[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:49.120]
i think you were right i don't think the democrats had much to say

[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:53.440]
they didn't seem to uh do any acting they just reacted to republican stuff

[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:57.240]
they voted against them in the president and they got out of step with the

[00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:03.400]
mainstream who is behind our what's the president so i i guess if you're going to go out

[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:06.640]
and slam the president vote against everything the president does when the

[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.320]
president's the most popular president we've had it a long time

[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:13.220]
you're gonna get thrown out of office i don't know you have to present an alternative

[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:16.600]
they could say the economy was a disaster and they presented no alternative

[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:22.500]
accurate did they reacted they didn't act they didn't say hey just to say the

[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:25.540]
economy isn't a mess and we're in another recession and then not have any

[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:28.620]
alternative what you're gonna do about it that doesn't convince too many people

[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:32.260]
exactly they simply said no we don't like what president's doing so we're gonna vote

[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:35.460]
again and you know and you know why they didn't do it because they were scared if

[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:39.160]
you're running scared you're gonna lose no actually these are the same people

[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:42.480]
who right now go for president a couple of years ago

[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:47.900]
now i don't like bush i really find them just faithful to religious crap and all

[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:50.560]
those other yes well you know you know i'm coming from

[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:56.440]
take a look but i i'm not real afraid of with how al-Gore who ran for president could have

[00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:00.620]
been stupid enough to have come in at a time when the economy was good enough

[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:05.440]
and you know everything was cool and how did he manage to lose well you got to be pretty

[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:11.880]
stupid to have lost against George w bush absolutely correct that's right that's right

[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:17.240]
it's called snatching the feet from the jaws of victory that's right yeah okay and and what happened

[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:21.400]
this time with and your notice and your notice here is one of the most popular presidents in history

[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:25.760]
that he didn't want to campaign with him in like Arkansas and the Clintons home state and want

[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:29.900]
to blues now just about they hold deep south as a result of it so the guy spilled a little

[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:35.320]
semen on a blue dress yeah he still was a great brilliant president good guy and well like didn't

[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:41.680]
respect it yes now so now we have nine eleven come along and bush whether we like him or don't

[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:47.580]
like him he held me at least as well as gore would have handled things no and so he comes across as a

[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:53.200]
strong protect america kind of a guy no he doesn't we look look let me say this yeah see no you're

[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:57.580]
making it much too complicated if issues like that would have been important like here in florida

[00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:01.460]
we just had to vote loads of Haitians it showed very clearly that this whole thing about

[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:05.740]
homeland security is just like the dog and pony show they're doing it to airports we're not safe

[00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:10.180]
well there's no homeland security it's just it's just a dog and pony show for the public so to

[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:13.980]
suggest that is because he's doing such a great job and who are in terrorism where we haven't caught

[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:19.340]
Osama we haven't caught this one I mean that's not the issue has nothing to do with it issues had

[00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:23.920]
nothing to do with it the fact is the democrats came across this weak need and impotent and they lost

[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:29.300]
but now take the McBride situation you're posing yes yes you are I'm gonna run I'm sorry but here's

[00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:33.790]
the deal with McBride McBride comes up and makes some announcement that I've got this plan for

[00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:38.090]
better education for the kids and we're gonna blah blah blah and then somebody says where's this

[00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:44.510]
money going to come from dude and he goes yeah he comes up with an answer that a third grade math

[00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:50.030]
student can figure out wrong then the same electorate who votes against McBride who wants more education

[00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:54.910]
votes for a constitutional amendment that's going to raise our tax right right right and you know

[00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:59.030]
what and you'll agree with me on this I know you maybe you're brilliant you're brilliant yeah

[00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:06.810]
yeah in closing yes in closing lousy parenting causes lousy grades good kids from good families whose

[00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:12.070]
parents care get good grades in our crappy school and the kids who come from cockroach families don't

[00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:15.950]
do too well in school and the parents don't I say let's put them all in a goddamn pup 10 forget the

they keep on coming

[01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:16.250]
there is a girl in extra wide jeans a girl who's head weighs a ton

[01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:27.210]
and she's living with the women and the funny play toys in the house of the lives

[01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:37.470]
we all in the first I need a little pot when she was young at a restaurant with a boy he didn't know

[01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:52.790]
that she was gay until he noticed each time they went out she went for the seafood buffet

[01:00:55.230 --> 01:01:05.390]
just look at all those in steak sisters now just look what they have done

[01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:17.810]
Jesus Christ the minute she comes home from work to the door well off her pants she's come

[01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:30.570]
oh wait a moment she laid it down to stop publishing the rosy mag left a laid off staff not paid

[01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:42.530]
and rose is girlfriend who's pregnant right now I guess she just only got laid

[01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:54.550]
there is a girl with extra wide jeans entertainer she's become

[01:01:54.550 --> 01:02:07.190]
home and she goes by the name of rosy oh dee in the house of the lesbians

[01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:17.270]
10 18 at 5 60 w 2 m here's the facts from oh Dave the cop well I haven't heard from him

[01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:21.630]
in a long time and that's good thing I guess he's faxing out not calling good he says

[01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:24.390]
Clinton departure from the White House caused a terrible leadership vacuum

[01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:30.470]
Minnesota was lost to fence itters after that ridiculous funeral service pep rally for

[01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:35.790]
wellstone the democrats turned off everyone well I'll say it again and I don't doubt that that

[01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:40.350]
had quite a bit of impact but if that's if that's the and supposedly Minnesota they're like

[01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:44.330]
intellectual you know they're educated they're better than the rest of us if that's the

[01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:49.110]
effect that's going to decide what you're going to cast your vote on then wife bother well look

[01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:54.550]
at mark prior in the Arkansas chalk up up with the democrats that was about it that was the only one

[01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:59.330]
and every other single close raise at least South Dakota still like a progress I think within

[01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:03.930]
100 votes they're not finished that looks like the republican there may eek it out or not tune

[01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:10.030]
but all the other close ones carnahan amazari she just barely got beat and then of course

[01:03:10.030 --> 01:03:13.390]
Catherine towns and Kennedy and Maryland I'm going to tell you to show how you put into the

[01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:17.250]
democrats were and not only was your name Kennedy and she got beat but this is in a state

[01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:21.610]
Maryland where it's against a lot of you republican I think I mean no republicans ever win in

[01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:27.750]
Maryland but she managed to again grasping defeat from the jaws of victory and what what

[01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:33.590]
qualification did she have anyway to be governor she was no spiral anus 287 votes on a poll what's

[01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:38.950]
your take on Tuesday's election I we're having a party we're so excited about it tons him coming

[01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:44.870]
yes he is Wayne Arnold is coming today that's right we're tossing aside our sack and we're bringing

[01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:50.490]
out the older good stuff have a little celebration here from Wayne Arnold's Royal Castle and our good

[01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:56.530]
buddy Hudson who whips up a mean newly burger with her without cheese who's that in the door whether

[01:03:56.530 --> 01:04:02.350]
some communist who is that it's Pete it's her best friend PD Lenny yes hey go put some real close

[01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:08.550]
on okay will you just come back those things stink I guarantee he sleeps in that thing whatever

[01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:13.770]
that that suit maybe Greg can make him a deal or the trade out for some good suits probably

[01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:17.770]
spoilers image you better look at the mirror before you leave the house in the morning Pete I don't

[01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:23.550]
where we going line nine I'm so confused with this phone thing now you know although the show

[01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:29.190]
is just taken off like crazy that we're taking calls again I tried to tell Tom jikoman this idea of

[01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:35.650]
yours and not taking calls it sucks Tom wq I am yeah yes sir how you doing pretty good good news

[01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:41.670]
according to ABC news 10 johns and the democrats out the code is ahead by 500 votes all right

[01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:47.070]
and it's 100% precinct reporting well there you go see we pulled one out of our ass but you know

[01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:51.870]
you know who feels better about that dash on dash actually saying oh my god is this embarrassing

[01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:58.110]
that's like when gore lost Tennessee you know right safe face but you're confusing a sweep or

[01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:03.990]
you know control of Congress with the landslides I mean if this is a mixed election this wasn't a

[01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:09.290]
sweep of land no no the country is the country is divided right down the middle but but see the

[01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:12.730]
thing of it isn't election as you know it it's like a horse race in a race horse race you don't

[01:05:12.730 --> 01:05:16.710]
have to win by three lengths to be the winner and the same in election if you win by 10 votes or if

[01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:21.690]
you fix it by 500 you're the winner so you don't have to have a sweep in addition to which all the

[01:05:21.690 --> 01:05:25.670]
power goes on the basis of a number of people in the congress it's got nothing to do with how many votes

[01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:31.110]
they won by well the problem with the democrats is that they're trying to be like republicans it's

[01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:35.410]
me too is I'm trying to imitate them instead of why I said that yesterday I said that back in

[01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:38.730]
the early eighties Reagan and that was when they first started this with their good right wing

[01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:43.110]
brought again Christian friends is to make the word liberal a dirty word so all of us on the

[01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:47.210]
spineless democrats all almost all of them back the way from it oh yeah we're not liberal and they

[01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:51.370]
try to be more and more centrist and less and less liberal and that's a pile of crap what's wrong

[01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:55.190]
with being liberal but the problem is they're not offering an attractive alternative right what is

[01:05:55.190 --> 01:06:00.370]
their message they have no message that's correct and and you know unless they do that they're

[01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:05.950]
going to continue to lose now as far as 2004 I see it as Kerry and Robert Rubin the former

[01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:11.250]
ex-chargerry secretary how about Ellis Rubin I think Robert Rubin the vice presidential nominee

[01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:16.810]
the strongest can strongest ticket well I wouldn't I wouldn't be planning that far ahead the way

[01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:20.050]
that the this administration is going you know where on that road armageddon we might get there

[01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:26.550]
before 2000 or so but the democrats nominate Al Gore my guy oh no see now now we may have to cancel

[01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:30.650]
that order for lunch now you just spoiled my day a little bit please don't say that I love that

[01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:35.050]
um that Fox News Heather bit that is just that is the great well you'll be hearing at least

[01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:40.890]
to 20 30 times no how about 30 40 times okay you got it all right Neil see you yeah he's right if they

[01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:45.210]
now so Tim Johnson pulls it out of his ass in South Dakota the democrats must have found a couple

[01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:49.650]
hundred dead people well you know it's easy to find in South Dakota because there's so much open

[01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:53.630]
space I never been there have you been in there South Dakota yeah I've been through there think

[01:06:53.630 --> 01:07:01.290]
it's in badlands the band of North Dakota which is featureless oh a blank plane

[01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:07.650]
kind of like the everglades no no the elder everglades has some animals and character well so

[01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:13.130]
so what is it now instead let me do my math let's see 48 now that's all right is it 51

[01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:18.150]
I think that's right 51 48 and one the independent they keep showing it over and over again well

[01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:22.090]
no they they but they just change it because if South Dakota went to the democrats if he pulled it

[01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:29.490]
that was close as a witches tight as a witches ass Alaska look at that Stevens well who cares

[01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:34.650]
about them up there anyway you know we're gonna screw them up five six seven oh five sixty

[01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:41.190]
they'll be seven on five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line we're gonna send grace

[01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:49.590]
slick up there first and then the world slick wq I am how you doing sir no I'm good kind of

[01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:56.550]
you know your birthday will forever be remembered as black Tuesday but you had a good birthday and

[01:07:56.550 --> 01:08:03.470]
well you know when you get to be 60 I think in more ways than one you're right yeah um you know I've

[01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:06.950]
been pondering this whole situation and I think you're right you can't get too bent out of shape

[01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:12.490]
because uh the republic republicans control this and it you know the senate's moderating force

[01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:17.310]
in the in the congress anyway um while the right wingers are unable to get a lot of their stuff

[01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:22.810]
on a mandatory not to mention of course those right wing judges baby but that that is the scary

[01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:26.390]
thing though is that they might be able to get some of those wackos through now because of the

[01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:35.610]
majority that's the thing yeah so just don't get caught doing anything bad on a federal level oh man

[01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:40.370]
you're gonna get fried or fried do a chain gang I now forget about doing anything I wouldn't be

[01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:44.190]
thinking about anything bad would be I think the thought police escorts working on the thought

[01:08:44.890 --> 01:08:49.070]
yeah you know you're turning the like you like that thing in Delaware where they are

[01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:52.950]
resting if they think that you're if they believe you're thinking about committing a crime

[01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:58.650]
oh yeah sure and that's true that's in debt and the state of debt filing yeah well what is

[01:08:58.650 --> 01:09:02.930]
this East Germany are they the stasi how do they know we're you know what people are they know

[01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:07.810]
mr don't be asking any questions they know they have they it's kind of like Santa Claus they know

[01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:12.130]
who's been naughty and nice they've been checking the list twice okay well despite all this mess I

[01:09:12.130 --> 01:09:16.690]

want to support Neil Rogers well now you're bringing up something that's completely different no i

[01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:31.030]
think that's why i think that's the biggest problem you got you don't like Neil Rogers and you

the Neil Rogers tell you since the day i walked since the day i walked into this place he's done

[01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:48.050]
everything he can undermine this program since when i'm getting down a bit brass tax i'll

[01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:52.130]

[01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:58.550]
wq i m no yes ma'am hey i love your show i always listen to it yeah i have i need to touch a

[01:15:58.550 --> 01:16:05.490]
three points with you touch a row one one of the things that uh that we probably why are you

[01:16:05.490 --> 01:16:12.410]
whispering i see okay one of the things that the republicans have their advantages that the

[01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:18.490]
platform they build together they're not divided and democrat hard i mean inside the democratic

[01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:22.010]
party well if that's the case then how come there were so many republicans against the

[01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:27.790]
uh invading a rack well so many i don't know but let me just tell you that there is a lot

[01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:33.210]
the democrat party is yeah and how about Richard shelby who's the head of the uh you have become

[01:16:33.210 --> 01:16:37.850]
from different sections we have the liberal we have a nine no but how come Richard shelby was uh

[01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:42.230]
screaming and yelling about the incompetence of the c i in the fb i and about the poor job the

[01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:48.270]
administration did uh before but you go ahead i agree with you but he's a republican let me just

[01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:52.650]
tell you something well you just went up holding the big back now there are a whole bunch of

[01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:58.450]
but anyway go ahead i mean you know i mean the way i see it is that the republican party is super super

[01:16:58.450 --> 01:17:03.970]
they have their platform they know what they they talk about the democrats we don't have help

[01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:10.950]
anybody the media it's just pounding at us and another thing is that the republicans have so

[01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:16.110]
much money i mean so much money unfortunately this election was decided ever since they had that

[01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:21.350]
cheatsayla pennies the fox news people have a lot more dangerous too well yeah and you know what i

[01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:28.790]
mean this people have the their packet to fill with money but like bright lost it wasn't because he

[01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:34.670]
wasn't a good candidate he was it's just that he did not have money he ran a pretty crappy campaign

[01:17:34.670 --> 01:17:39.070]
and the caller before was right the second debate that was what cooked his goose yeah thanks to

[01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:44.970]
team rasser which i lost totally my respect for him i mean team rasser pounded my bride and he

[01:17:44.970 --> 01:17:49.770]
gave it in the air to the slide to jump bush if you remember if you remember i didn't watch it

[01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:52.850]
i'm why what i watched the debates what i already knew who i was going to vote for why did i

[01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:59.050]
which i didn't vote anyway what i bother doing it today is a sad day is it is really no it's not yes it

[01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:05.190]
is why it is why is it a sad day it is i mean the democrats i mean they didn't go out on vote

[01:18:05.190 --> 01:18:10.570]
don't you understand that the both political parties stink don't you understand that i don't think

[01:18:10.570 --> 01:18:15.230]
we're screwed the average person in this country is screwed in tattooed i don't think so i think

[01:18:15.230 --> 01:18:21.290]
the democrats have been doing a good job i'm doing what well by promoting i'm losing every key

[01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:26.110]
election uh you know under the sun well thanks to the media that day every time that we want to

[01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:30.090]
open our mouth and talk about the economy nobody wants to look at it they haven't wanted to open

[01:18:30.090 --> 01:18:33.010]
their mouth and talk about the economy they don't have any plan for the economy all they

[01:18:33.010 --> 01:18:37.570]
want to do is say the tax cuts were bad and screwed us up and put us in a recession but they have

[01:18:37.570 --> 01:18:41.570]
no alternative they haven't brought us anything to the table bring it to the table maybe

[01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:47.890]
mavel black label bring it to my table but thanks for the call she's she's too worked up for me i don't

[01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:53.490]
want to get all depressed she's depressed i understand that it's not like a football game okay see

[01:18:53.490 --> 01:18:59.010]
too many people view politics and republicans and we know the democrats all a bunch of crooks like

[01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:02.490]
that poll says there look at a hundred and three twenty nine percent of the people in this audience

[01:19:02.490 --> 01:19:06.310]
say what difference does it make her all a bunch of crooks anyway and they're right it's just that

[01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:09.390]
some crooks are a little more dangerous than the other ones but they're all a bunch of crooks

[01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:17.670]
and this business and i guess it worked in new jersey okay but this business up there

[01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:21.270]
Minnesota we're gonna you know dust the water out of the moth balls and bring them out

[01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:26.010]
didn't work too good i thought he was pretty good in that debate the other day when i saw of it but

[01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:30.350]
you know the problem is people don't listen to the substance uh that's that's america for you when

[01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:34.530]
you're dealing with so many stupid people it's the sizzle not the substance that's right all they

[01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:38.310]
want to see is oh this uh this norm quote man guy he looks like he's under the age of a hundred

[01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:42.750]
and he's still alive and can maybe walk a little bit wilder he looks like he he uh is em bombed

[01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:47.870]
he looks like they just turned him loose from madam to soswax museum like i said he looked 74

[01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:55.330]
going on 104 he he did he didn't look uh that plus his speak barely speak you know not not in his

[01:19:55.330 --> 01:19:59.430]
positions or his politics and just not going to affect it plus of course remember where's the beef

[01:20:00.670 --> 01:20:04.210]
yeah that was how mean it was a good line but it was a you know didn't do too good against Ronnie

[01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:09.730]
Ray gun didn't do this uh stop and think about the great choices the american public sat in these

[01:20:09.730 --> 01:20:15.710]
presidential elections i'm not that we had one but it just in general stop and think about him

[01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:22.530]
Michael de caucus in george johurber walker bush oh water mondayl and roggle ragan

[01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:30.390]
jimmy Carter and ronald ragan al gore and george dohyah uh uh uh uh uh lush

[01:20:33.130 --> 01:20:37.210]
don't forget on the state level either uh i understand that but that's what it boils down to

[01:20:37.210 --> 01:20:41.350]
that's why people say well it's the less or a two evils well what kind of a god damn country is that

[01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:46.430]
there's mondayl i'm on his success yeah okay water good luck to

[01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:51.730]
poor water i mean i like water mondayl i think he's a pretty good guy but he's four hundred

[01:20:51.730 --> 01:20:55.070]
years old, you know, it doesn't work too well. What were they going to do? They had to

[01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:59.330]
they were desperate. And then of course some people are going to say, we know that plane

[01:20:59.330 --> 01:21:04.130]
crash is awfully suspicious. I don't think so. But there will be some paranoid assholes

[01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:08.110]
who will say that. Some people make comedy bits about that. And they will not get played

[01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:16.030]
on the show. And certainly not too late to stop that check. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5,

[01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:21.590]
60 on the 8th. Oh, it is to late on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. I'm sure he

[01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:25.610]
don't waste any time. The book of myster. He's all right. There's that money store right

[01:21:25.610 --> 01:21:30.270]
over here. I'm sure he goes there right on the way back up the Hershey highway. On the

[01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:36.610]
way back up the Ho Chi Minh Trail. So that's good. That at least offers me some hope. The

[01:21:36.610 --> 01:21:40.410]
fact that there's an open door to this meeting so we can kind of clear the ear a little

[01:21:40.410 --> 01:21:43.870]
bit. Well, there's certain things that are musty in this place. That's a good reason I'm

[01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:50.210]
getting out of here fairly soon. It's kind of musty. Some hair pieces, little musty

[01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:55.010]
that Kajmer bouquet. Who else was it that came in a few days ago and smelled? Shirk my

[01:21:55.010 --> 01:22:00.550]
hand. Somebody I like. But smelled my hand all day long. It was, oh, God, I wanted

[01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:06.070]
to take a shower. Who was that? It was a few days ago. Someone came in here. I hadn't

[01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:12.010]
seen in quite a while. For a strafford. No, he don't smell like the crow. People that

[01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:15.110]
have been in there. The crow might have been. And you know something who was sitting in

[01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:18.890]
there with the day the crow was in with the Carlos me. Carlos also I think was somebody

[01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:22.810]
was in there. Okay. Yeah. That's right. When I said do you see what I'm saying? Nobody

[01:22:22.810 --> 01:22:27.490]
ever believed me about that. He I think he like jumps into a tub of Kajmer bouquet before

[01:22:27.490 --> 01:22:34.390]
he leaves the house every day to crow. Sure. A lot quicker and taken a shower. Twenty

[01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:38.010]
me four eleven and five sixty WQM. Let me tell you a great place you want to go and hang

[01:22:38.010 --> 01:22:41.090]
on. In fact, this would be a great place to go tonight. Get away from all the stress

[01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:46.010]
of yesterday's election. Pompadot Park. Go and plunge your guts out, baby. Lose thousands

[01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:50.570]
or maybe win thousands, whatever. Pompadot Park is open for live harness racing every

[01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:53.790]
Wednesday Friday and Saturday three nights a week. Don't forget the earlier new post

[01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:58.330]
time 715 PM. Free general parking, free clubhouse and grandstand emission every afternoon

[01:22:58.330 --> 01:23:01.950]
night. So come on for an evening or great harness racing action. And don't forget on the

[01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:05.670]
fourth floor you can treat yourself to a private box or enjoy a Ben and Jerry's hot

[01:23:05.670 --> 01:23:09.490]
foot Sunday or slides of bubble lotty's pizza, slides of pizza. And don't forget every

[01:23:09.490 --> 01:23:12.290]
Wednesday like tonight is dollar night. You can get you a draft beer hot dog soda

[01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:16.370]
large pretzel or popcorn for only a bucket piece. And Pompadot Park's excellent top of

[01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:19.410]
the park restaurant on the sixth floor is open every live race United, including tonight

[01:23:19.410 --> 01:23:23.630]
for fine dining featuring chef Kirk Lade's nightly specials and the best seafood steaks

[01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:27.970]
and primer dinners in town. I eat there. It's in even I need a watch as enjoy eating.

[01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:32.570]
It's a even I even a fat old bag like me enjoy eating there. And of course I eat for free.

[01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:36.010]
So I like it even more every seated at the top of the park restaurant offers a panoramic

[01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:39.790]
view of the races with a private TV monitor. Oh look at that. Looks like Mickey McNichols

[01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:43.310]
coming out of stretch. He'll finish fourth again. There's also that great all you can

[01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:46.850]
eat for fan to fourth floor players. Long journey 1095 per person every racing night.

[01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:50.730]
Of course, but it comes to simulcasting every day nights, starting at noon, seven days

[01:23:50.730 --> 01:23:54.030]
a week Pompadot Park's got to go in for you with highlight harness and terberad racing

[01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:57.550]
action. So for a great night away from all the tourists and the stressing grief, take

[01:23:57.550 --> 01:24:00.930]
the whole gang out for a great night tonight. Get lucky at Pompadot Park. Powerline road

[01:24:00.930 --> 01:24:03.790]
block south of prestigious Atlantic Boulevard in Pompino B.

[01:24:04.050 --> 01:24:08.650]
Five and a local. This is five sixty. The rain is all yours.

[01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:16.370]
You and Larry King and they don't come any better than Neil Roger.

[01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:21.950]
I know a way to do it from our good friends at Winkercark to travel. Aspin Colorado. That's

[01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:27.190]
the place to go if you like skiing. Imagine for a moment you're on the slope. You put

[01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:32.910]
your knees together, bend slightly forwards and then you grab your pole while you put

[01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:35.050]
the other hand on the edge of the table.

[01:24:39.710 --> 01:24:43.510]
This is unacceptable. We wrote this. I think it was time.

[01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:49.350]
I'm not Mr. Sipkod. I know who's responsible for this sabotage. This is the heavy work

[01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:54.510]
that I thank you to Poof in that train guamal of a monkey of his. Well the jokes on

[01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:58.530]
them. Well have you know I got connections in New York.

[01:25:07.190 --> 01:25:12.390]
You'll see you now. Godfather what do you know what do you say?

[01:25:12.850 --> 01:25:17.990]
My most because the dreams friends what can I do for you on the day of my

[01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:23.590]
thought as a portion. I am here to the man that you grant me a favor. I want a sink

[01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:27.110]
in a head on Neil Roger. What have I done to be treated with such

[01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:35.070]
disrespect? Well Godfather the end of my rope. Every day they got me raked. Using my

[01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:42.090]
name in vain and just making fun of my veins. I said no it's in here. I'm weak and

[01:25:42.090 --> 01:25:49.870]
I'm not like that. You know who I am. You're a man who deserves respect. So here's

[01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:54.990]
a ticket to Vegas. Vegas. Get me free. I already live in paradise. I ask you don't

[01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:59.170]
talk to a man like Boat with like that. I want you to take care of our friend Mr.

[01:25:59.390 --> 01:26:03.030]
Mo over here. Sure Pop. Okay take your pants off fella. Let me show you a good

[01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:07.990]
time. Could you hands off me a big dummy? I ain't dumb. Goddum you stupid. Yeah but not

[01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:12.410]
like they say. Give me a hand here where you look up. I am on a day break. Have a

[01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:18.190]
towel in the smile. They keep a quiet day. You know. You got to take the

[01:26:18.190 --> 01:26:47.890]
algunos drugstore all paint does not always sit back.

[01:26:47.890 --> 01:26:48.050]
Nobody should have gone since we moved. I just did. One step further I will

[01:26:48.050 --> 01:26:48.170]
take care of that. I just do still some of the different patterns. I'm going to

[01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:51.170]
is the QA MV that we're going to make it up to Palm Beach, you know that you're

[01:26:51.170 --> 01:26:54.150]
number one in your time slot up here unless that's big Georgia doing a show. Well

[01:26:54.150 --> 01:26:57.650]
thanks a lot Uncle Bill, Swiss said I'm number one unless you're doing a show. Maybe

[01:26:57.650 --> 01:27:01.530]
they just don't like Spix and Roll Palm Beach. That's alright, they're on their way.

[01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:04.890]
Okay so you guys who think you're so smart up there, they're on their way. Here's a

[01:27:04.890 --> 01:27:08.790]
great cartoon from one of our regular cartooning factors. So it was the

[01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:12.950]
capital building for the big sign that says Arbite Moth Fry with the Gates in

[01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:15.990]
front of it and here's a little character. It looks kind of like Dr. Mangal that

[01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:19.410]
may walking with his GOP satchel on this way. It says Bill Common New Congress.

[01:27:20.610 --> 01:27:26.210]
Well that's where it goes. Good luck to all you who live in the US. Here's a

[01:27:26.210 --> 01:27:28.990]
poll where I don't think I'm gonna take the time to read this long faction. The

[01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:31.410]
poll worker and Broward is upset with that nice lady that was Washington or

[01:27:31.410 --> 01:27:35.530]
Dogg. I'll just read this part. To the dog washing bitch who called and said they

[01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:39.050]
wouldn't let her husband vote. F you and your husband. We've been over back

[01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:41.810]
way to make sure everyone could legally vote at our precinct. When we had people

[01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:44.270]
come in here we're not registered to vote at our precinct. So we had a

[01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:47.250]
sentence of precinct where they were registered. We had people come in who had

[01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:50.470]
already requested an absentee ballot. You can't let them vote again. There are

[01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:53.090]
procedures to follow a yachty-a yachty-a yachty and closing the new head of their

[01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:56.530]
fox bit and it kills me so it's so goddamn funny. Poll worker and Broward.

[01:27:56.550 --> 01:28:01.150]
Well I stopped there. They had a really pretty good a good job. I made a couple of

[01:28:01.150 --> 01:28:03.390]
complaints earlier yesterday which had nothing to do with the poll workers. I

[01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:06.410]
did with a couple of malfunctioning machines but nevertheless I mean why

[01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:10.290]
nitpick about that? So you voted for McBride and it showed up bush you know. Why

[01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:13.730]
get excited about that? Maybe there were only like two three hundred thousand

[01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:18.330]
machines like that but I doubt it. Now the fix was already in because McBride stuck

[01:28:18.330 --> 01:28:24.030]
his foot down his throat. Unprepared we campaign. Democrats just aren't up to

[01:28:24.030 --> 01:28:26.830]
it. They're not up to the challenge. You know I'm saying they're not they just

[01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:31.910]
don't have the stuff anymore. Remember that moving the right stuff? Democrats

[01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:38.790]
have the wrong stuff. George of course has the good stuff. 389 votes yeah he

[01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:41.470]
wishes he had the good stuff. He keeps insisting I bring it back from Amstit

[01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:46.410]
I'm and of course it's not worth it. Once you're taken Tuesday's election results

[01:28:46.410 --> 01:28:51.450]
I'm ready to leave the country 115. They're all about your crooks 114. I'm

[01:28:51.450 --> 01:28:55.950]
ecstatic 82. I'm suicidal 48 and I just don't give a Schmidt 30 people said that.

[01:28:56.450 --> 01:29:00.450]
I have a 389. Lunches on the way from Wayne Arnold are good buddy Hudson will be

[01:29:00.450 --> 01:29:04.570]
here no time. I'll have some Neely burgers some white hats. Drummets. What you

[01:29:04.570 --> 01:29:07.790]
don't like but they're not in the city. I don't like drummets and you want to know why?

[01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:13.190]
Brett is there. Brett and Deep Pride. Brett and Deep Pride which will kill you

[01:29:13.190 --> 01:29:20.250]
extra fans. Anything boiled and fat. Yeah. WDQ I am. Neil yes sir. I'm a moron and a

[01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:24.010]
train monkey and I want to thank you for having a show especially designed for me.

[01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:28.910]
Good. Thank you sir. You're welcome. And we got a lot of train monkeys out there and morons

[01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:33.190]
and that's why we have such big numbers. I mean majority of people aren't there.

[01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:36.410]
I even even when it comes to the sports nerds you know even some of them have a

[01:29:36.410 --> 01:29:39.870]
sense of humor not too many. Most of them take it very serious. When we go out

[01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:43.330]
there we want to really kick some ass and the guy who gave that aren't we blessed

[01:29:43.330 --> 01:29:48.990]
and never dawned on me again boy. That guy must be psychotic now. Not only we have

[01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:51.970]
the bad weekend last weekend but then after a Saturday without shaky

[01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:56.470]
erectors given in Monday night with a green Bay game. And I'm so sick and tired

[01:29:56.470 --> 01:30:01.170]
of the people on this radio station. Uh stuck it up for Ray Lucas man. Okay so

[01:30:01.170 --> 01:30:04.270]
the first half he wasn't that bad and no he didn't lose the game all by himself

[01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:09.250]
but my god this get his tragic he's pathetic. Why can't the people on this radio station tell

[01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:14.430]
it like it is. I've been around a block a few times they seem more guy than football games in my

[01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:18.370]
time than most of these people in their whole lifetime. In fact in the average season I see

[01:30:18.370 --> 01:30:21.630]
more than these people in lifetime because I got the package while they're sitting there glued to

[01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:30.990]
the dolphin game. That kid is pathetic. He is not ready for prime time. Oh well it wasn't all his

[01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:35.190]
fault. But maybe better open than he had that stinger. He's always got a stinger. He had a

[01:30:35.190 --> 01:30:40.670]
stinger and then he came out with a stinger that Ray Lucas. Another trained monkey. WQ I am.

[01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:45.870]
Neil. Yes man. You have a nice birthday. Great the best. It sounds like you did so.

[01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:50.050]
Oh this is flow? Yeah. Oh chronic flow. Get out of here. What?

[01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:54.970]
No she wants to call to tell me. No I don't it's not that I don't appreciate the uh

[01:30:54.970 --> 01:30:58.930]
when I gave the right name I read the card it was uh uh uh uh uh uh

[01:30:58.930 --> 01:31:04.990]
lawn and flow whatever it was or whoever. I read whatever it was on the card right?

[01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:09.830]
right. Thanks very much. Her voice mail from the flower. Thank you very much. I mean what

[01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:16.350]
it's they didn't get credit for it? CNN understands that you said Mindy. I did not say Mindy.

[01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:20.790]
I bet you a lot of money on that. I didn't say no Mindy. Oh we got the tape. I'm out of

[01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:23.370]
the side of it. I'm out of the side. I'm out of Maureen Mindy but I'd say they're a Dorken Mindy.

[01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:26.770]
I'd say anything about Maureen Mindy or just playing Mindy or any Mindy. We used to be on

[01:31:26.770 --> 01:31:30.450]
getting life by the way which I never see anymore. God damn it. What channel is uh

[01:31:30.450 --> 01:31:37.630]
CBS on here real quick? Four? Oh three. This cable blows. Man this cable really sucks. Oh there it is.

[01:31:40.810 --> 01:31:46.790]
This tape. John. And you're the second one. Jackie. And your hotel. Same case.

[01:31:47.730 --> 01:31:51.850]
Like I said there's Alexander. One right in the other with sucks. And Olivia.

[01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:57.450]
Oh looks like a real concertobs there between Alexander and Olivia and I'm missing all the

[01:31:57.450 --> 01:32:00.750]
guiding lights stuff. How come I can't get no guiding lights fire reports because we have no

[01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:04.310]
women calling in on the show except the ones who want to tell us that was me that saying the

[01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:08.410]
thanks a lot flow. Well you were the one I was bitching around before the show today. You're

[01:32:08.410 --> 01:32:13.550]
getting psychotic. You sure as hell were you had a voicemail on there and then he had a voicemail

[01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:18.390]
from the floors and he had 16 other voicemails. I gave credit and then of course it's got this heavy

[01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:22.670]
rocket to bottom to a shot that was candy. Well okay. Doug right in there's another reason.

[01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:27.530]
Next time put chocolate on the bottom floor and uh lawn. Wasn't it lawn which I always say that

[01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:34.070]
it's lu I don't know. No seriously if you sense uh if somebody sends me something and they really

[01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:37.670]
want to do it you know because they like me or they like to show or they want to for my birthday

[01:32:37.670 --> 01:32:43.870]
what differences make it vagnology or not right? No it makes a lot of difference. It does while

[01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:49.930]
they have to say their name. That brings to my mind questions about the sincerity of the gift okay.

[01:32:50.050 --> 01:32:54.390]
Flow flow flow flow flow. Yeah I'm gonna throw your ass right on the floor and I'm in if you don't

[01:32:54.390 --> 01:33:05.290]
cut the crap. Oh no. Say I didn't talk about flowing how she's all bad on a shape. What a

[01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:11.210]
shame that is. Hey Mo maybe it's in hook you up with flow. Flow in the motion. With Joe as a guest.

[01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:16.610]
Oh I wish I had nothing this to do the whole show on healing. You're gonna pass that.

[01:33:16.630 --> 01:33:20.230]
Oh my god. The one more time you're gonna fly in. Not not with lunch on the way.

[01:33:21.670 --> 01:33:25.050]
Oh black. I took a big gulp even at 7-11 they never saw a big gulp like that.

[01:33:26.610 --> 01:33:30.550]
It's held like a little on helium now he's really gotta worked up. Oh it's out like guilty now.

[01:33:32.010 --> 01:33:35.770]
Holy crap you heard that it's a little bit higher and higher just like guilty getting the ball.

[01:33:35.770 --> 01:33:41.990]
Oh anyway thanks Flow. I love that. Remember the time we had the um at IOD.

[01:33:42.190 --> 01:33:48.170]
The take. We had a whole tank of helium in the studio and then then we discovered that after you take about

[01:33:48.170 --> 01:33:54.350]
five six hits of that you start getting lightheaded and pass out because it displaces the oxygen so you're not breathing out.

[01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:59.650]
Is that what it is? Yeah but I do like that sound man it's a great sound. Oh I was gonna remind me to do it on

[01:33:59.650 --> 01:34:06.170]
that tomorrow from that the real audio because that the clips from my wow I'm still puzzled about that.

[01:34:06.490 --> 01:34:11.810]
The rich shot. I was doing a show in 76 on the station called himself Jim London or something like that.

[01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:16.810]
Maybe with your name contract. Negotiating. No I'm serious it was definitely rich shot got the audio and then we also got Tanner.

[01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:23.570]
What? We got Tanner on there from my 100 and then there's some clips from I 95 on there.

[01:34:23.690 --> 01:34:27.230]
Some there's some pretty boring stuff. What's his name's on it? Earl the Pearl.

[01:34:27.810 --> 01:34:33.610]
Our good friend. Yeah our good buddy Earl the Pearl is someone of the clips and um oh and Tanner's out with Jim really.

[01:34:33.930 --> 01:34:38.710]
Oh see that that's another I don't understand I know they were on for years together in my 100 but I don't

[01:34:38.710 --> 01:34:45.130]
understand that perfect at all that pairing. Do you it's a Catholic thing?

[01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:52.390]
Bill Tanner ain't no Catholic. Yeah but he. No are you gonna start with the altar bore lines again?

[01:34:54.930 --> 01:34:58.890]
We're supporting you 560. You a. M.

[01:35:00.630 --> 01:35:06.770]
The most disgusting program I urge everyone to complain to this station okay.

[01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:10.590]
Hey Bob Fungu and Bob Fungu you.

[01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:19.530]
I heard you're getting married.

[01:35:20.290 --> 01:35:25.470]
You're getting married. What a stupid thing to do.

[01:35:26.370 --> 01:35:31.970]
I say as a friend that marriage can be scary.

[01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:44.710]
You're being as one fine sexy babe. Why ruin what you have that way and maybe what happened twice to me.

[01:35:44.910 --> 01:35:56.350]
Will make you do what happened. Maybe just as crappy for you because it sucks to be married.

[01:35:59.930 --> 01:36:03.950]
What do we have here on newlyweds showcase Kenny it's an all expense paid pre-knock to

[01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:08.730]
the agreement to look joyous days of electro shock therapy at green hopes love.

[01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:11.930]
Bottoming spa. Complete set of porcelain dishes.

[01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:18.790]
A fine addition to any dining room. Like wait and easy to throw and a solid wooden chair

[01:36:19.390 --> 01:36:24.090]
and trapped in an perfectly balanced for easy lifting when breaking them over each

[01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:51.130]
other's back growing to see a quarterall sh剛剛 and garden over the

[01:36:51.130 --> 01:36:56.350]
up to a five sixty w.u.a.m. the only reason Volka Brian did that bit is because he's really pissed off

[01:36:56.350 --> 01:37:02.190]
at Joe about that wedding invitation. He complains to everyone about that. Yeah, I can find

[01:37:02.190 --> 01:37:05.910]
something. He's sending a guy a wedding invitation to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars to fly

[01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:10.170]
to Las Vegas and then bring you a gift to attend your wedding. It's just in very, very poor form.

[01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:14.930]
Very pissed off. Fulming at the mouth runs. He was he was a costee as I was trying to get out of here

[01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:18.830]
that day was last week. He was stopping people to park in Lafayette. He didn't even know screaming

[01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:21.810]
about. He was talking with the car wash guy. Can you believe that cheap son of a bitch?

[01:37:21.970 --> 01:37:24.330]
It must be to fly out to Vegas and go to his wedding so I can bring him a gift.

[01:37:25.930 --> 01:37:29.270]
Oh, speaking of that, man accused of microwaving girlfriend's dog. Oh!

[01:37:31.170 --> 01:37:35.670]
This is a true story. It must be because it's from the wicked web. A man has been arrested in the

[01:37:35.670 --> 01:37:40.950]
US after allegedly microwaving his girlfriend's dog. Police say Everett S. Howes of Springfield,

[01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:44.170]
Illinois was jealous of the amount of attention his girlfriend was giving the pet.

[01:37:44.590 --> 01:37:47.790]
According to the state journal register is being held in the Sangamon County,

[01:37:47.790 --> 01:37:51.610]
Jeb was facing a possible charge of animal abuse aggravated cruelty. The police were called

[01:37:51.610 --> 01:37:54.990]
a house he's home by his girlfriend. When they arrived, they found a pillowcase on the front

[01:37:54.990 --> 01:38:00.490]
porch that contained the remains of a small, groundish black dog. Witnesses told.

[01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:07.150]
Isn't yours more black and tired? Yeah. Well, witnesses told police that Howes of

[01:38:07.150 --> 01:38:10.710]
the 41's had a blue bag around the dogs. They put the live animal in the microwave then turned on

[01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:14.890]
the oven. The police reports his officers examined the microwave and found evidence that seemed

[01:38:14.890 --> 01:38:18.890]
to indicate the dog had put inside the oven. That seemed to indicate. How is he? Was not

[01:38:18.890 --> 01:38:22.290]
a home on the police arrive? A contact in the authorities when he heard that officers were looking

[01:38:22.290 --> 01:38:28.470]
for him. How do you like that? And here's another great fact that just came in. The average driver

[01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:34.350]
emits more than 912 pints of wind inside a car during his or her lifetime. I don't realize you

[01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:40.070]
measured farts in pints. Did you know that? No. There might be British. Fat boy said he heard it

[01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:45.570]
was quartz. The figures released by the BBC Top Gear magazine and list of statistics profiling

[01:38:45.570 --> 01:38:49.090]
the average driver. Well, probably that's the brits do that because they fart a lot more than we do

[01:38:49.090 --> 01:38:51.970]
because of all that spotted dick. Although they wouldn't call it pints now. Would they? Of course,

[01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:57.070]
you fart a lot too if you had that old toe in the hole. The survey also found the average driver

[01:38:57.070 --> 01:39:02.170]
will have sex in a car six times in their lifetime. And how are they talking about with somebody else?

[01:39:03.290 --> 01:39:07.490]
They'll spend around two hours and 14 minutes kissing in their motors. Kissing in their motors

[01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:12.830]
reser... Oh, these brits man just killed me. Mr. or Mrs. Average will swear or blasting 32,

[01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:17.170]
25 times behind the wheel and peckish motorists each month through about

[01:39:17.170 --> 01:39:20.810]
months through about 21 pounds of chocolate as they turned along. Now, I don't think so.

[01:39:21.630 --> 01:39:26.290]
Well, that's possible. I've had a few king sides. No, I'm talking about candy bars.

[01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:31.690]
You know, you candy bars in the car. No, not in the car. They got a cold out of the fridge.

[01:39:31.690 --> 01:39:37.390]
Nah. Who the hell can wait to get home in the fridge? They'll also not offer the wheel 11 times

[01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:41.690]
and jump 181 red lights. Well, you brits man. You're a bunch of barbarians. Here's a good fact.

[01:39:42.990 --> 01:39:47.030]
It says, I'm not a violent person, but I want to kick the Schmidt out of Tucker Carlson at

[01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:49.910]
right wing faggot. Love you and you'll see you in Amsterdam. There you go.

[01:39:51.190 --> 01:39:54.930]
I've taken the low light of the entire campaign, the lowest of the low.

[01:39:55.870 --> 01:40:00.970]
To show you what about your schmucks the public are in Georgia where that sex be a sexless,

[01:40:00.970 --> 01:40:07.670]
shameless guy beats Max Cleveland, the American Vietnam War hero. When they three,

[01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:12.230]
they triple amputee who lost two legs at an arm and he attacked him,

[01:40:12.330 --> 01:40:16.570]
provoking 11 times against the Homeland Security. But he was all for the Homeland Security.

[01:40:16.730 --> 01:40:21.170]
I just not diversion of it that the president he proposed, but no confuses with the facts.

[01:40:21.810 --> 01:40:26.010]
So the implication being he's unpatriotic, he's not for Homeland Security. Just like

[01:40:26.010 --> 01:40:29.430]
our president, he was doing that thing about, well, you know, that Democrats are for national security

[01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:36.450]
and it worked. It worked. And so Max Cleveland loses based on the fact that he's not patriotic,

[01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:42.790]
a man who enlisted in the army to serve in Vietnam during a time of war enlisted.

[01:40:44.090 --> 01:40:49.050]
Gives up three limbs. And the public said, yeah, I think you're out of the point.

[01:40:49.230 --> 01:40:52.530]
Of course, don't forget, George is where entry is.

[01:40:54.590 --> 01:40:56.330]
And that corn sure is special.

[01:40:58.450 --> 01:41:01.710]
Well, let's see, as a follow up to Mr. Jikers article about how the colors are part of the

[01:41:01.710 --> 01:41:04.970]
make up, you sure I have a theory. If Book of Bryan's bits help the show and he gets paid,

[01:41:04.970 --> 01:41:08.850]
so the colors should help them. But please may my check to the mid-church redemption

[01:41:10.170 --> 01:41:13.570]
and the Democratic Party. Okay, I'll end the checks out of way. Not.

[01:41:13.930 --> 01:41:17.910]
Don't be trusted. Book of Bryan will send it to you as soon as he catches that check.

[01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:22.930]
5, 6, 7, hey, by the way, floor your balloons are getting in my way. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6,

[01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:26.750]
8, where the hell's the food already? Oh, that's why he's hanging around so long. I knew there

[01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:31.510]
had to be some good reason. What? He can sense it. He was on his way before we made the call.

[01:41:31.610 --> 01:41:33.990]
He can smell it. Because when he first came in this morning, he said,

[01:41:34.330 --> 01:41:38.710]
boy, I thought it was maybe most peace or maybe that bag open again. Now, oh, you didn't tell him

[01:41:38.710 --> 01:41:42.770]
what I said the other day about who cleaned up that bag and how he did it. No, I would not.

[01:41:42.850 --> 01:41:45.390]
I don't tell him that. WDQAM.

[01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:53.550]
Oh, that must be what that guy was doing. WDQAM.

[01:41:54.810 --> 01:41:57.950]
Oh, we got a run now, baby. We got the runs. WDQAM.

[01:41:58.330 --> 01:42:01.850]
Happy birthday, Neil. Thanks. And many, many happy returns.

[01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:03.930]
Uh-huh. It's Woody. Go ahead, hang up.

[01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:08.010]
Okay. That's three in a row. We got a traffic vector. We need to please.

[01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:11.650]
Oh, yeah, we're here to please. I mean, if we can hang up on floor, we can shrink up on your ass.

[01:42:13.330 --> 01:42:16.970]
So I guess throughout a material again, huh? We only got to noon. Then we got to noon to one hour.

[01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:19.430]
Which would be great. You want to know why? Because it'll be the eating hour for me.

[01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:22.410]
Play all the comedy bits like we do every Wednesday between noon and one.

[01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:26.270]
We certainly don't want to play any of those mode bits, though, because, uh, it's time.

[01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:30.590]
No, no, no. No, we might. In fact, people will just play all like that one day.

[01:42:30.710 --> 01:42:34.550]
I think we have an hour's worth now. That would be bad. That would be in very poor form.

[01:42:34.570 --> 01:42:35.990]
I think Joe put the put you up to that.

[01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:41.910]
5670560 pound. Yeah, see, he sucks up to his face. You know, it puts on a happy face,

[01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:44.470]
because you got to see me every day. You ought to hear the things he's been telling me.

[01:42:45.970 --> 01:42:49.290]
WDQ I am. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, Neil.

[01:42:49.690 --> 01:42:51.690]
Hello. Will Manners. Yes, sir.

[01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:54.590]
Kick you an email with Halloween costume with a priest.

[01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:58.190]
Got a little little boy stuck to his crotch. Yeah.

[01:42:58.610 --> 01:43:00.430]
hilarious. What's your email address or George's? Whatever.

[01:43:00.570 --> 01:43:01.790]
What's our email address, George?

[01:43:04.130 --> 01:43:05.250]
Uh, okay. I'm sorry.

[01:43:06.130 --> 01:43:07.970]
No, you don't forget. What's one I actually check?

[01:43:08.050 --> 01:43:11.450]
No, we don't do email. Okay, forget about the email. He's got a hilarious sick heart too.

[01:43:11.450 --> 01:43:13.650]
He wants to send it to George. Give him your home email.

[01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:15.970]
Give him. Yeah, right. Give him a was email.

[01:43:16.210 --> 01:43:18.570]
No, see, that's what started this whole thing was you and that email.

[01:43:19.210 --> 01:43:21.850]
George does bad emails. Or we don't want to start a whole another

[01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:25.110]
simmiss again. Okay, because once George starts sticking around with email,

[01:43:25.110 --> 01:43:27.590]
especially other people's, then there is hell to pay.

[01:43:29.190 --> 01:43:32.690]
So just lay off the emails, unless it's Lynn Samuels.

[01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:34.650]
Pa pa pa pa. But actually she and I have been going.

[01:43:34.770 --> 01:43:36.770]
I think we got something going on. She and me.

[01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:39.430]
I heard your a type.

[01:43:41.450 --> 01:43:44.670]
Let me tell you about your mattress. Okay, it's probably getting lumpy and old and smelly.

[01:43:44.730 --> 01:43:46.290]
Because God, we know what's been going on on it.

[01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:47.850]
So pick up the phone and call our good friends.

[01:43:47.970 --> 01:43:49.810]
And I see I keep saying that. Stop saying that.

[01:43:50.150 --> 01:43:53.590]
Stop saying pick up the phone. Whoever writes our copy, whoever that idiot is,

[01:43:53.650 --> 01:43:54.910]
keeps putting that in every piece of copy.

[01:43:55.130 --> 01:43:56.690]
They know they have to pick up the phone.

[01:43:57.170 --> 01:43:58.710]
Jesus, they've got to have a speaker phone.

[01:43:58.810 --> 01:44:02.810]
Okay, so put down the phone and call 1-800-MATRUS.

[01:44:02.970 --> 01:44:06.710]
1-8 that just frosts my ass that we got such a lack of creativity in this joint.

[01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:10.290]
1-800-MATTRES because they give you great service.

[01:44:10.290 --> 01:44:12.790]
Whatever mattress you're looking for, whatever top brand you like.

[01:44:12.970 --> 01:44:14.230]
CERDA, Celi Simmons, King Coil.

[01:44:14.490 --> 01:44:16.990]
They got them all in stock ready for just about immediate delivery.

[01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:18.990]
And again, not when they're ready to do it.

[01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:20.150]
But when it's convenient for you.

[01:44:20.250 --> 01:44:21.810]
Any day, seven days a week, any to our window.

[01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:24.790]
When you're going to be home, like between 10 a.m. and noon, 11 and 1,

[01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:26.990]
2 and 3, 4, whatever that is.

[01:44:27.390 --> 01:44:29.270]
And they give me that 30 day in home comfort guarantee.

[01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:32.350]
So you don't have to worry about just lying down in the department store

[01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:33.730]
and hoping that it's really the one for you.

[01:44:33.970 --> 01:44:36.790]
You get to sleep and do your thing on it for up to a month before we decide

[01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:38.410]
if the mattress is the right one for you.

[01:44:38.410 --> 01:44:41.790]
So get yourself a great new mattress at an unbeatable low every day price

[01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:42.730]
like I always do.

[01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:44.530]
And even the lovely Miguel did this last time.

[01:44:44.530 --> 01:44:45.510]
He's pretty happy about it.

[01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:46.370]
And you will be too.

[01:44:46.510 --> 01:44:52.010]
1-800-MATTRES or check out their website at mattress.com.

[01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:54.270]
I'm out of my mind.

[01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:54.550]
I'm low.

[01:44:55.210 --> 01:44:56.970]
This is sports 20 or 560.

[01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:58.430]
You way up.

[01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:01.590]
They hang this up, baby.

[01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:06.030]
Wouldn't it be great if you could get a massage whenever you needed one?

[01:45:06.490 --> 01:45:07.910]
You can with Vibratouch.

[01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:11.610]
The battery operated massager that fits right on your finger.

[01:45:11.670 --> 01:45:12.910]
I love my Vibratouch.

[01:45:13.150 --> 01:45:14.350]
It's all I need.

[01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:17.630]
Vibratouch vibrates at over 9,000 cycles a minute

[01:45:17.630 --> 01:45:20.210]
for deep, long lasting satisfaction.

[01:45:20.530 --> 01:45:24.410]
Vibratouch is adjustable so I can adjust it to fit on my favorite finger.

[01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:28.650]
Vibratouch comes with four Vibratips and a handy carrying case

[01:45:28.650 --> 01:45:32.010]
so you can vibrate yourself anywhere you go.

[01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:34.070]
It's great at work or riding on the bus.

[01:45:34.450 --> 01:45:35.730]
And the Vibratouch is quiet.

[01:45:35.730 --> 01:45:39.010]
The guy on the bus this morning thought I was having an epileptic fit

[01:45:39.010 --> 01:45:40.930]
until I showed it my Vibratouch.

[01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:43.330]
Have your credit card handy and call now.

[01:45:43.670 --> 01:45:45.330]
It's 1-800-Touch-It.

[01:45:45.690 --> 01:45:47.370]
That's 1-800-Touch-It.

[01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:50.030]
Vibratouch operators are standing by.

[01:45:50.210 --> 01:45:53.470]
Honey, the UPS guy just delivered a case of battery.

[01:45:53.610 --> 01:45:54.310]
That's right, Jack.

[01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:57.870]
When I said the Vibratouch was all I needed, I meant it.

[01:45:58.350 --> 01:45:59.950]
You'll be hearing from my attorney in the morning.

[01:46:00.730 --> 01:46:01.950]
I'm not sick.

[01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:03.790]
Right there.

[01:46:04.930 --> 01:46:07.770]
And speaking of that, the New York Post is a Mattelist

[01:46:07.770 --> 01:46:10.450]
of making its best selling Harry Potter vibrating broomstick.

[01:46:10.930 --> 01:46:13.330]
But the toy company says its decision is not based

[01:46:13.330 --> 01:46:16.150]
on the plaything's popularity as a preteen sex toy.

[01:46:16.810 --> 01:46:19.530]
As we reported in September, Mattel's Nimbus 2000

[01:46:19.530 --> 01:46:21.790]
who raves from kids but horrified parents

[01:46:21.790 --> 01:46:25.630]
who found their teenage daughter is riding the buzzing 1999 broomstick.

[01:46:25.710 --> 01:46:27.010]
Was it think they were going to do with it?

[01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:29.210]
Maybe the thought it was Halloween, I don't know.

[01:46:30.330 --> 01:46:32.390]
In the wake of our stir-A time out in New York,

[01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:34.570]
even rated the Nimbus along with bona fide vibrators

[01:46:34.570 --> 01:46:35.370]
and its sex issue.

[01:46:35.770 --> 01:46:38.130]
But they might tell rep claims.

[01:46:38.130 --> 01:46:39.450]
It's not because of the stories.

[01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:42.410]
It's just not a continued product in our 2002 line.

[01:46:42.670 --> 01:46:44.790]
Strange considering the Harry Potter franchise is stronger

[01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:45.970]
than ever, it says here.

[01:46:46.250 --> 01:46:47.690]
In the New York Post, so it might be true.

[01:46:48.130 --> 01:46:48.910]
In that right-wing rag.

[01:46:49.190 --> 01:46:49.750]
How do you like that?

[01:46:50.490 --> 01:46:51.870]
They're riding it like a broomstick.

[01:46:53.810 --> 01:46:54.430]
Hello, George.

[01:46:55.410 --> 01:46:56.670]
463 votes on the poll.

[01:46:57.250 --> 01:46:59.730]
What's your take on yesterday's election results, huh?

[01:46:59.970 --> 01:47:00.710]
What are you taking now?

[01:47:00.710 --> 01:47:02.110]
Probably a lot of people taking a big hit.

[01:47:02.230 --> 01:47:03.350]
Yeah, what's the same to me?

[01:47:04.590 --> 01:47:05.910]
A big heavy duty one.

[01:47:06.630 --> 01:47:08.330]
They're all a bunch of crooks 141.

[01:47:09.230 --> 01:47:11.370]
I'm ready to leave the country 138.

[01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:13.290]
I'm ecstatic 93.

[01:47:14.050 --> 01:47:15.730]
Let's hear something for those people who are ecstatic.

[01:47:16.350 --> 01:47:16.710]
Okay.

[01:47:17.370 --> 01:47:20.570]
I'm suicidal 55 and I don't give a shmit 36.

[01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:21.330]
That was my vote.

[01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:23.370]
So you come in and last place just like the elections.

[01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.710]
Hey, that's okay.

[01:47:24.770 --> 01:47:25.290]
I'm used to it.

[01:47:28.250 --> 01:47:28.630]
5670560,

[01:47:28.810 --> 01:47:30.710]
Palm 560 on the AT&T in Verizon.

[01:47:31.010 --> 01:47:32.750]
And but you think I'm going to get a guiding light update?

[01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:33.330]
I guess not.

[01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:34.330]
You will.

[01:47:35.490 --> 01:47:35.870]
WDQIM.

[01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:36.990]
Hi, Neil.

[01:47:37.210 --> 01:47:37.690]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:47:37.730 --> 01:47:38.530]
Guiding light update.

[01:47:38.670 --> 01:47:38.970]
Told you.

[01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:42.590]
I've been wanting to talk to you since you got back to South Florida.

[01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:45.030]
You can watch guiding light at 3 in the afternoon

[01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:46.870]
on Channel 12 out of West Palm.

[01:47:47.090 --> 01:47:47.890]
Are you kidding me?

[01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.950]
No, you know what?

[01:47:49.130 --> 01:47:52.430]
Channel 4 in Miami is one of the few markets in the entire country

[01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:53.650]
that's airing at 10 in the morning.

[01:47:53.650 --> 01:47:57.130]
I know in Toronto they carry these seat belts not in Toronto.

[01:47:57.390 --> 01:47:57.990]
Maybe in Buffalo.

[01:47:58.250 --> 01:47:58.410]
Buffalo, yeah.

[01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:59.570]
And they carry the three o'clock.

[01:47:59.770 --> 01:48:01.190]
It was a Channel 4 decision.

[01:48:01.190 --> 01:48:02.690]
It wasn't a CBS decision.

[01:48:02.850 --> 01:48:03.810]
Well, Channel 4 sucks.

[01:48:04.110 --> 01:48:04.390]
I know.

[01:48:05.290 --> 01:48:07.730]
So I don't know when's the last time you saw it.

[01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:10.530]
But Alan and Olivia got married last week.

[01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:11.490]
Oh no.

[01:48:11.710 --> 01:48:12.310]
Oh my god.

[01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:13.810]
But right before the wedding,

[01:48:14.290 --> 01:48:16.130]
Olivia and Philip got stuck in the elevator

[01:48:16.130 --> 01:48:19.590]
and they were making out and Alexander has it on tape.

[01:48:19.930 --> 01:48:23.010]
So yesterday she presented Olivia.

[01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:24.570]
She said this is your wedding dress.

[01:48:25.770 --> 01:48:27.550]
And it's the tape of her making out.

[01:48:27.730 --> 01:48:30.730]
And she's got the pre-knop with Alan that if she cheats on him,

[01:48:30.810 --> 01:48:32.750]
she gets nothing plus he gets the beacon.

[01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:34.010]
So she's blackmailing me.

[01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:36.590]
Yeah, I saw the last minute of it this morning.

[01:48:36.690 --> 01:48:38.850]
I flipped over there and I sat down with her in each other's push.

[01:48:39.090 --> 01:48:39.230]
Right.

[01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:42.410]
When what Channel 4 shows in the morning is really from the day before,

[01:48:42.630 --> 01:48:43.550]
Channel 12.

[01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:45.430]
So you're actually even getting at a day behind.

[01:48:45.690 --> 01:48:46.110]
Oh boy.

[01:48:46.250 --> 01:48:48.130]
So anyway, do you pick up Channel 12?

[01:48:49.010 --> 01:48:49.950]
I doubt it.

[01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:51.350]
Too bad.

[01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:53.350]
How long am I going to do that?

[01:48:54.510 --> 01:48:56.870]
I thought maybe it was on your satellite or something.

[01:48:58.390 --> 01:49:00.110]
Yeah, because I'm a...

[01:49:00.110 --> 01:49:02.230]
Well, I can find it somewhere probably on my big dish,

[01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:03.170]
which I never use anymore.

[01:49:03.170 --> 01:49:04.210]
I can find it on the big dish.

[01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:05.830]
You really haven't missed that much.

[01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:07.110]
It's been kind of weeks.

[01:49:07.450 --> 01:49:09.830]
But to me, since they brought Joan Collins on the show,

[01:49:09.970 --> 01:49:10.950]
I can't stand her.

[01:49:11.970 --> 01:49:12.130]
So...

[01:49:12.130 --> 01:49:13.690]
No, the last Alexander was the good one.

[01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:14.430]
The real Alexander.

[01:49:14.670 --> 01:49:16.010]
Yeah, nobody will ever outdo her.

[01:49:16.130 --> 01:49:16.850]
I'll tell you, passions.

[01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:18.730]
Oh, yesterday they had the...

[01:49:18.730 --> 01:49:19.330]
Was it yesterday?

[01:49:19.330 --> 01:49:20.470]
That day before when...

[01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.970]
What's your name?

[01:49:21.050 --> 01:49:22.490]
Was taking a shower with Miguel?

[01:49:23.130 --> 01:49:23.670]
Stark naked?

[01:49:23.890 --> 01:49:24.890]
You don't watch parents do that.

[01:49:24.890 --> 01:49:25.030]
I don't like that.

[01:49:25.110 --> 01:49:26.010]
Oh, you're missing out.

[01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.810]
It's guiding light.

[01:49:27.170 --> 01:49:27.570]
You're missing out.

[01:49:27.650 --> 01:49:28.410]
Maybe I should switch.

[01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:29.730]
Guiding light has been kind of weak.

[01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:31.950]
And it's been guss and harle and harle and doesn't.

[01:49:32.110 --> 01:49:32.550]
And I don't like that.

[01:49:32.770 --> 01:49:33.890]
I don't like that story.

[01:49:34.050 --> 01:49:34.530]
I'm not interested in that.

[01:49:34.770 --> 01:49:35.890]
What a lame story.

[01:49:36.130 --> 01:49:38.430]
Next up, he'll be bringing back that red necklace.

[01:49:38.690 --> 01:49:40.030]
Daddy of hers too, he'll be coming back.

[01:49:40.490 --> 01:49:40.850]
Right.

[01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:41.410]
No, he's not.

[01:49:41.530 --> 01:49:42.150]
Whatever he is.

[01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:42.550]
Grandpa.

[01:49:42.810 --> 01:49:43.030]
Right.

[01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:46.150]
But, Dom, I guess that's about it.

[01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:47.430]
Okay, thanks for the bad news.

[01:49:47.610 --> 01:49:47.990]
I've been missing.

[01:49:49.330 --> 01:49:49.810]
All right, bye.

[01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:50.570]
Happy birthday.

[01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:51.190]
Thanks a lot.

[01:49:51.770 --> 01:49:52.870]
That's like most self-harpers.

[01:49:52.930 --> 01:49:54.150]
You don't watch for a few months and you come back.

[01:49:54.210 --> 01:49:55.370]
And you pick right up where you left off.

[01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:57.190]
Well, a couple of things have, and no big deal.

[01:49:58.090 --> 01:50:01.230]
Let's see, here's a long, long, long facts.

[01:50:01.450 --> 01:50:02.370]
And the bottom line says,

[01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:04.930]
keep your passport handy and pray to Jesus for the best,

[01:50:05.170 --> 01:50:07.090]
because God effs those who eff themselves.

[01:50:07.850 --> 01:50:08.730]
That's a good line.

[01:50:09.090 --> 01:50:09.630]
I like that.

[01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:11.570]
I think he's got a good point.

[01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:12.510]
No, God.

[01:50:13.170 --> 01:50:15.190]
Religious cokes who are once identified precisely

[01:50:15.190 --> 01:50:18.530]
as that are taking his offering serious input about reality.

[01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:21.370]
In that regard, we're simply following the rest of the world,

[01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:23.090]
everywhere fundamentalists of every stripe,

[01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:26.450]
fleeing the march of modernity are determined to lead a headline

[01:50:26.450 --> 01:50:27.610]
retreated into the past.

[01:50:28.290 --> 01:50:30.390]
Hypersionist freaks are set to take control in Israel,

[01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:33.290]
even in moderate Turkey, crazy towelheads have brought a pill

[01:50:33.290 --> 01:50:35.550]
in the Muslim world, and fanatical Hindus in India

[01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:37.970]
push for a nuclear showdown with the PAKIs.

[01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:41.810]
The Democratic Party is a joke, it has no message whatsoever.

[01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:43.930]
They completely rolled over while Bush and

[01:50:43.930 --> 01:50:45.810]
Ascroft instituted step after step

[01:50:45.810 --> 01:50:47.910]
in building an authoritarian surveillance state,

[01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:49.270]
the USA Patriot Act, you're right.

[01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:51.910]
There's been more principled opposition from some

[01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:54.290]
damned Republicans like Ron Paul, Bob Barr,

[01:50:54.570 --> 01:50:56.910]
Oi, Richard Shelby, etc., than they lily lily lily

[01:50:56.910 --> 01:50:59.370]
Democrats, the so-called leaders that leaders

[01:50:59.370 --> 01:51:00.870]
in like Jeb Bush's quotes, you know,

[01:51:01.150 --> 01:51:02.530]
the leaders of the Party are disgrace,

[01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:06.610]
dash of the aptly named Dick Gebhardt, Hillary Queen,

[01:51:07.150 --> 01:51:08.450]
I can't say the C word Clinton.

[01:51:10.370 --> 01:51:12.690]
No, forget Boca Brands, a guy that took the O out of country.

[01:51:13.830 --> 01:51:15.990]
It says, maybe John Kerry will offer legit option

[01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:17.210]
for Democrats in 2004.

[01:51:17.210 --> 01:51:20.090]
If so, it will only be the second time in over 30 years.

[01:51:21.330 --> 01:51:23.510]
Says, I'm not the one who thinks the Bush stop will burn

[01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:25.670]
down the Raspst lot on 9-11, where they certainly have taken every

[01:51:25.670 --> 01:51:28.450]
advantage of this tragedy to aggrandize their power

[01:51:28.450 --> 01:51:29.490]
and then goes on.

[01:51:29.550 --> 01:51:30.350]
Good facts, excellent.

[01:51:30.890 --> 01:51:32.110]
Nobody's listening, but good facts.

[01:51:32.250 --> 01:51:33.610]
Nobody wants to pay any attention to it.

[01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:35.930]
Give me the ball, give me the ball, give me the ball,

[01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:37.670]
okay, Shufro, that's what it's all about.

[01:51:38.530 --> 01:51:39.930]
A lot of open lines here aren't there?

[01:51:40.010 --> 01:51:43.810]
A couple, 5-6-7-0-5-60, pound 5-60 on the AT&T line,

[01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:45.770]
got 40 minutes to kill, and it's a good thing

[01:51:45.770 --> 01:51:47.210]
that lunch is taking so damn long today.

[01:51:48.810 --> 01:51:50.750]
Because it'll time out exactly with that great new

[01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:51.190]
to 1 hour.

[01:51:51.330 --> 01:51:53.130]
And I've gone air hot sense, probably what they had in mind.

[01:51:54.270 --> 01:51:56.210]
481 votes on that poll, they're pouring in.

[01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.790]
WQAM.

[01:51:59.050 --> 01:51:59.670]
Hey Bill.

[01:51:59.850 --> 01:52:00.150]
Yes sir.

[01:52:00.710 --> 01:52:01.290]
What's going on?

[01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:02.090]
How you doing?

[01:52:02.710 --> 01:52:06.170]
Listen, I went on voting, is it the first time I voted yesterday

[01:52:06.170 --> 01:52:09.730]
in a while, and I live over here in Sunrise.

[01:52:09.930 --> 01:52:11.230]
Are you familiar with Sunrise Wake?

[01:52:11.610 --> 01:52:11.870]
Yes.

[01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:12.850]
Okay.

[01:52:15.210 --> 01:52:18.030]
You don't sound old enough to be allowed into Sunrise Wake.

[01:52:18.290 --> 01:52:22.650]
I live just outside, but my precinct is inside Sunrise Wake.

[01:52:23.210 --> 01:52:23.710]
Oh, boy.

[01:52:24.910 --> 01:52:29.630]
I walk up to the thing and I head to like the 6-7-0-8,

[01:52:29.770 --> 01:52:32.510]
he's just pounding me, man.

[01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:37.370]
You know, I go to the vote, I finally realized

[01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:40.190]
why so many problems with these odd people, man.

[01:52:40.190 --> 01:52:43.870]
These people are in there between the lady running the bills

[01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:46.770]
and helping the old lady out and telling them,

[01:52:46.810 --> 01:52:48.270]
don't let anybody else in.

[01:52:48.790 --> 01:52:50.790]
If they cook me in the middle of your cane,

[01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:53.870]
this lady's telling these people

[01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:56.910]
if she let anybody else in, they should have worked their cane.

[01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:58.150]
Okay?

[01:52:58.490 --> 01:52:59.770]
Good thinking, I like it.

[01:52:59.870 --> 01:53:00.770]
They'd love to see that.

[01:53:00.890 --> 01:53:02.210]
They'd like to see that.

[01:53:02.210 --> 01:53:04.230]
Okay, well listen, when you get a new phone call, it's back someday.

[01:53:05.690 --> 01:53:09.870]
567-0-560, pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:11.650]
Many, many open lines now, all of a sudden,

[01:53:11.730 --> 01:53:13.990]
is this hour to bottom is just falling off today.

[01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:16.430]
I may have to actually do some bedtime stories here

[01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:18.450]
to kill out, fill out the hour, which would be very Saturday.

[01:53:18.710 --> 01:53:19.710]
I'm just not in the mood to do it.

[01:53:20.250 --> 01:53:22.330]
I'm just not in the mood to do it after the election yesterday

[01:53:22.330 --> 01:53:25.070]
and all of a sudden, all the countertops that went on here

[01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:26.770]
in the building this morning, just a bizarre,

[01:53:27.650 --> 01:53:30.370]
a bizarre episode there at about 848 this morning

[01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:32.730]
in the control room with a molemyster.

[01:53:35.050 --> 01:53:37.330]
I'm telling you, my psychic abilities are scary as hell.

[01:53:37.330 --> 01:53:39.170]
I have to start my own day because at least it would be

[01:53:39.170 --> 01:53:42.030]
somewhat legitimate, unlike those other fakers on their way.

[01:53:42.150 --> 01:53:43.970]
I miss Cleo and all those, and she's old Griffin

[01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:46.030]
because I really do have psychic abilities,

[01:53:46.450 --> 01:53:47.450]
not so much as a track,

[01:53:50.290 --> 01:53:52.010]
but definitely in life in general.

[01:53:52.130 --> 01:53:54.030]
I'll say, hey, how's so-and-so doing in the door?

[01:53:54.090 --> 01:53:55.970]
We'll open in the walk-in like two seconds later.

[01:53:56.670 --> 01:53:58.010]
Watched it happen all the time.

[01:53:58.130 --> 01:53:58.270]
Right.

[01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:02.690]
Talking about somebody, lady call me about guiding light.

[01:54:02.810 --> 01:54:03.590]
I punch up the nice light.

[01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:04.230]
There she is.

[01:54:07.330 --> 01:54:09.870]
And this morning, I have no idea why.

[01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:11.590]
I discovered these analove beads,

[01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:13.150]
and I thought it would be appropriate to go in there

[01:54:13.150 --> 01:54:15.130]
and hang them kind of in front of the mole and guilty,

[01:54:15.550 --> 01:54:16.610]
and the crowd in the control room.

[01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:18.930]
Now, some people thought it was someone amusing,

[01:54:18.930 --> 01:54:20.870]
but that just my bad timing or good timing,

[01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:21.710]
depending on how you look at it,

[01:54:21.730 --> 01:54:24.150]
was right at the time that guy called it was chewin' out low

[01:54:24.150 --> 01:54:26.690]
for a consortium with the enemy on Fox News on Monday.

[01:54:27.170 --> 01:54:29.570]
Would they anxious, laughing, hyena, Tony Bruno?

[01:54:31.110 --> 01:54:33.850]
And then he went to his impassioned hysterical defensive

[01:54:33.850 --> 01:54:34.210]
about how he was doing.

[01:54:34.210 --> 01:54:37.510]
Who cares about blah, blah, blah, and it's a syndicated show?

[01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:39.130]
Who the hell are you kidding?

[01:54:39.250 --> 01:54:40.270]
Come on, we'll get serious.

[01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:43.410]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:44.550]
Hello?

[01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.350]
Yes?

[01:54:46.090 --> 01:54:47.070]
I am by the way.

[01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:48.950]
How about you, pardon?

[01:54:49.890 --> 01:54:50.550]
It hurts.

[01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:54.090]
Always in Spanish?

[01:54:54.490 --> 01:54:54.610]
Yeah.

[01:54:54.890 --> 01:54:55.290]
I see.

[01:54:56.170 --> 01:54:57.530]
Speaking English on a show, okay?

[01:54:57.770 --> 01:54:59.330]
We got enough spictop down here already.

[01:54:59.630 --> 01:55:00.130]
Spick in English.

[01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:03.410]
We're gonna get that goddamn boat inflated again for you.

[01:55:03.410 --> 01:55:04.770]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.750]
Shamba?

[01:55:07.670 --> 01:55:08.850]
See, he's getting a little bit old.

[01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:12.550]
567-0562.

[01:55:13.290 --> 01:55:14.090]
Pound 562.

[01:55:14.130 --> 01:55:16.290]
Now, what was it about that doctor that did J. Feetler's thumb?

[01:55:16.890 --> 01:55:17.730]
Pound 562.

[01:55:20.630 --> 01:55:21.890]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:55:23.130 --> 01:55:23.530]
Hello?

[01:55:25.890 --> 01:55:26.550]
Nobody there.

[01:55:26.850 --> 01:55:29.790]
See, this is one of the reasons I really enjoy taking calls on this show.

[01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:31.650]
Like I said, last week or so,

[01:55:31.650 --> 01:55:33.030]
last couple of weeks we've been doing this.

[01:55:33.250 --> 01:55:34.030]
Been a big improvement.

[01:55:34.170 --> 01:55:35.170]
Everybody's been in a better mood.

[01:55:35.410 --> 01:55:37.310]
Maybe they're all depressed because of the election yesterday.

[01:55:37.850 --> 01:55:41.210]
Maybe all of our people out there, like, uh, you know, in a sour mood.

[01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:43.150]
Because they take it all to God.

[01:55:43.150 --> 01:55:43.670]
They am seriously,

[01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:46.570]
as if we're gonna have some impact on changing the world out there,

[01:55:46.590 --> 01:55:47.210]
which we're not.

[01:55:47.570 --> 01:55:48.210]
Which we're not.

[01:55:48.530 --> 01:55:49.510]
Oh, we can make a difference.

[01:55:49.710 --> 01:55:50.210]
No, you can't.

[01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:53.070]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:55:54.850 --> 01:55:55.210]
Hello?

[01:55:58.210 --> 01:55:59.210]
W-Q-A-M. Hello?

[01:55:59.210 --> 01:55:59.250]
Hello?

[01:56:01.870 --> 01:56:02.490]
Nobody here?

[01:56:02.630 --> 01:56:02.890]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:56:03.490 --> 01:56:03.930]
Yeah.

[01:56:04.190 --> 01:56:04.530]
Yes, sir.

[01:56:05.290 --> 01:56:08.150]
I'm a coward and I wanted to apologize directly to you.

[01:56:08.630 --> 01:56:09.050]
For what?

[01:56:09.890 --> 01:56:14.770]
Well, I was wanting to get the gym managers autograph one day before the dolphin game

[01:56:14.770 --> 01:56:17.490]
and I was schlepping around down by the Q-A-M booth.

[01:56:18.230 --> 01:56:21.210]
I'm hoping to catch him walking by and going into the building.

[01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:24.870]
And I saw Mo and the immediate temptation was to say,

[01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:25.850]
hey, nice show, Mo.

[01:56:26.450 --> 01:56:28.470]
And I couldn't bring myself to do it.

[01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:29.390]
And I wanted to apologize.

[01:56:29.650 --> 01:56:32.750]
And I think I'm gonna protest the Q-A-M booth because I have that pre-game show.

[01:56:33.110 --> 01:56:33.330]
Yeah.

[01:56:33.570 --> 01:56:34.290]
And just take it, you know,

[01:56:34.370 --> 01:56:35.350]
I think like a big poster says,

[01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:36.990]
nice hair piece or something like that.

[01:56:37.110 --> 01:56:38.130]
Mo, why do you want to do that?

[01:56:39.290 --> 01:56:40.830]
Oh, I just, I don't know.

[01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:42.170]
You see, a lot of you people out there,

[01:56:42.210 --> 01:56:43.570]
you want to jump onto Badwagon.

[01:56:43.650 --> 01:56:44.870]
See, now you want to make it personal,

[01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:46.530]
which is exactly what I'm not trying to do.

[01:56:46.570 --> 01:56:47.550]
This is a radio show.

[01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:49.330]
Leave the comedy to me, okay?

[01:56:49.410 --> 01:56:51.010]
Don't worry about jumping onto Badwagon

[01:56:51.010 --> 01:56:53.150]
and start to try to make a guy feel like crap.

[01:56:53.290 --> 01:56:55.330]
That's not what we're trying to do in spite of what he thinks, okay?

[01:56:55.630 --> 01:56:56.170]
That's not good.

[01:56:56.250 --> 01:56:56.850]
That's bad form.

[01:56:57.690 --> 01:56:58.170]
Leave them.

[01:56:58.170 --> 01:56:59.290]
They don't want me to do that, then.

[01:56:59.790 --> 01:57:00.370]
Are you pregnant?

[01:57:00.770 --> 01:57:01.370]
You don't want me to do that?

[01:57:01.370 --> 01:57:02.470]
What did I just get you saying?

[01:57:02.650 --> 01:57:05.810]
I think it's a stupid idea is what I think.

[01:57:06.570 --> 01:57:08.210]
I think it's idiotic and childish.

[01:57:08.350 --> 01:57:09.250]
See, this is the promulgant,

[01:57:09.410 --> 01:57:10.970]
and especially you sports nerds out there,

[01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:12.370]
you're such a bunch of overgrown children.

[01:57:12.730 --> 01:57:15.450]
God, oh, the BCS pole, we're getting scrored,

[01:57:15.590 --> 01:57:16.750]
we're getting, there's a conspiracy.

[01:57:17.250 --> 01:57:18.730]
It is a conspiracy against idiots.

[01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:21.950]
So maybe it does have something to do with U of M

[01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:22.930]
when you come right down to it.

[01:57:23.190 --> 01:57:24.650]
Little, little, little, yeah, that's U of M.

[01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:26.270]
Boy.

[01:57:28.050 --> 01:57:29.570]
So you don't never get complacent.

[01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:31.710]
Don't feel you can sit back and actually like talk to people

[01:57:31.710 --> 01:57:32.770]
in this town, because you know,

[01:57:32.830 --> 01:57:34.670]
just because the last week and a half or two weeks

[01:57:34.670 --> 01:57:37.810]
or whatever it's been has been really a breath of a first year.

[01:57:38.730 --> 01:57:40.370]
This last hour turned into a breath of really

[01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:42.870]
failure, like maybe you didn't do such a good job

[01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:45.330]
with a job feeling, a job feeling up the globe.

[01:57:47.450 --> 01:57:47.730]
Suds.

[01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:52.790]
This is cute.

[01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:55.510]
Deer Neil, sorry it's taken so long to deliver your food.

[01:57:55.570 --> 01:57:57.430]
It's a new job to me since I left the radio station.

[01:57:57.490 --> 01:58:00.170]
A lot of movies that have hit blacks in here in Schwarzenegg town.

[01:58:00.230 --> 01:58:01.810]
See you soon with hot food, Suds.

[01:58:03.070 --> 01:58:04.310]
PS, I need a real good tip.

[01:58:05.730 --> 01:58:06.330]
How do you like that?

[01:58:07.670 --> 01:58:09.230]
Hey David, I got your facts yesterday.

[01:58:09.370 --> 01:58:10.350]
Okay, my former bag boy.

[01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:12.170]
Don't be wasting any more of my paper, all right?

[01:58:13.330 --> 01:58:15.430]
You'll be a former bag boy more ways than one.

[01:58:16.590 --> 01:58:19.230]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[01:58:19.670 --> 01:58:22.650]
On the AT&T in Verizon line, 27 past 11.

[01:58:22.970 --> 01:58:27.070]
Only 33 minutes until that blessed noon to one hour that we enjoy so much on Wednesday.

[01:58:27.230 --> 01:58:29.510]
Boy, do we enjoy it or we enjoy it a lot.

[01:58:30.330 --> 01:58:34.070]
You've heard us talk on this show and other shows also about fast train for a long time.

[01:58:34.290 --> 01:58:35.190]
Are you doing anything about it yet?

[01:58:35.290 --> 01:58:38.230]
Well, if not, get off your dead ass because the facts are very simple,

[01:58:38.370 --> 01:58:39.350]
like most of our listeners.

[01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:43.290]
If you have the dedication fast train will provide you with the necessary training to become

[01:58:43.290 --> 01:58:45.210]
a certified computer professional.

[01:58:46.610 --> 01:58:50.710]
According to Time Magazine, the demand for computer professionals is going to continue to explode,

[01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:53.730]
it's going to get bigger, it's going to get gigantic and humongous.

[02:03:36.450 --> 02:03:36.790]
Yes, sir.

[02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:39.790]
Hey, I couldn't call you. I should have wanted to wish you a happy birthday.

[02:03:39.790 --> 02:03:41.830]
Well, thanks anyway. I'm sure you made a gallon effort.

[02:03:42.110 --> 02:03:47.050]
Yeah, it's funny you played the kind of leaves of things, because I don't know if you heard about it, but on the Palm Beach Fox station,

[02:03:47.230 --> 02:03:51.250]
you had 29 on Monday nights, they had a whole thing called Waste This Radio.

[02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:51.730]
Yeah.

[02:03:51.890 --> 02:03:52.690]
So that was about it.

[02:03:52.810 --> 02:03:56.230]
Yeah. And they had had had a little bit behind.

[02:03:56.790 --> 02:04:00.050]
Yeah, they had had their own there and they showed her they played part of the kind of leaves of it.

[02:04:01.890 --> 02:04:02.350]
Yeah.

[02:04:02.350 --> 02:04:06.170]
Like John I'm a scientist morning, they ought to be wearing sheets at Fox News.

[02:04:06.370 --> 02:04:06.830]
Absolutely.

[02:04:07.450 --> 02:04:14.910]
Yeah. Also, over the weekend, I received a postcard from the Jewish National Federation saying how Jeff Bush is good for Israel.

[02:04:14.910 --> 02:04:15.610]
We should move for him.

[02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:17.210]
Yeah.

[02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:22.670]
Okay, well, call me again someday with some other old news. Okay. God almighty.

[02:04:23.770 --> 02:04:25.230]
What, what kind of a call was that?

[02:04:25.970 --> 02:04:28.830]
I think even some of the drag we've had in the last half hours better than that.

[02:04:28.890 --> 02:04:31.510]
Well, have a great day anyway, sir. It's better your lame effort.

[02:04:31.710 --> 02:04:36.470]
I think they're out of material. If anybody can sense it, WQ I am.

[02:04:36.730 --> 02:04:37.570]
Good morning, Neil.

[02:04:37.850 --> 02:04:39.450]
Neil, pardon me. Happy belated birthday.

[02:04:39.570 --> 02:04:42.050]
I'm having my midday meal right now as a matter of fact.

[02:04:42.270 --> 02:04:43.470]
It's called Meals Meal.

[02:04:43.730 --> 02:04:44.250]
What have a teeth?

[02:04:45.190 --> 02:04:45.950]
Just a couple of years.

[02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:51.630]
Well, first of all, Fox News, then you should tell the smile on everybody's faces with the whole change of power to have.

[02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:52.170]
Oh, yeah.

[02:04:52.170 --> 02:04:54.190]
Just a little bit of a ball over there.

[02:04:54.970 --> 02:04:58.810]
Another thing though, Neil, actually, what do you think of this amendment about the ban on smoking and restaurants?

[02:04:59.150 --> 02:05:00.010]
Because you think that's going to hold?

[02:05:00.550 --> 02:05:01.250]
Did that pass?

[02:05:01.570 --> 02:05:02.150]
Yeah, it passed.

[02:05:02.350 --> 02:05:04.450]
Oh, no. I didn't even pay any attention to it.

[02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:05.670]
I was so distraught with everything else.

[02:05:05.810 --> 02:05:07.530]
No stockies and restaurants or anything else.

[02:05:07.630 --> 02:05:10.030]
What a brilliant, what a brilliant move to make it a tourist day.

[02:05:10.150 --> 02:05:14.670]
Where all these people, all these four bastards in business depend on tourism and all the restaurants and bars.

[02:05:14.970 --> 02:05:17.190]
Oh, man. What a, what a schmuck state this is, man.

[02:05:17.310 --> 02:05:18.630]
On the island of the coffin, I think before.

[02:05:18.630 --> 02:05:22.670]
You know, this state is shaped like a schmuck and that's because the people are act like ones.

[02:05:23.050 --> 02:05:27.450]
Hey, if I, one I think I think all these colors are just making these stupid jokes or all bunch of douchebags.

[02:05:27.650 --> 02:05:28.370]
Okay. Thanks.

[02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:29.230]
See ya.

[02:05:30.710 --> 02:05:33.330]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on it.

[02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:34.910]
This is bad for me right to be eating on it.

[02:05:34.970 --> 02:05:36.590]
So after I do the break, then we'll start playing stuff.

[02:05:37.130 --> 02:05:37.470]
Look, what?

[02:05:37.670 --> 02:05:37.870]
What?

[02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:39.410]
It's a capital idea.

[02:05:40.490 --> 02:05:40.850]
WQAM?

[02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:44.490]
Yeah, this guy kind of gave me a lead in on the big issue.

[02:05:44.770 --> 02:05:44.970]
Yes?

[02:05:45.650 --> 02:05:47.970]
When you take the anal beads, do you square the...

[02:05:47.970 --> 02:05:48.710]
Yeah, see, there you go.

[02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:51.910]
Like I said, I can tell that they're, you know, when they're out of material.

[02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:54.090]
That sounded almost like Reverend Jones's boyfriend to me.

[02:05:55.610 --> 02:05:57.910]

[02:05:58.470 --> 02:06:00.970]

[02:06:06.570 --> 02:06:07.690]

I'm your average white, except for the night's long.

[02:07:58.570 --> 02:08:02.050]
I like football and porn, I'm books about war.

[02:08:02.730 --> 02:08:06.510]
I got an average house with a nice hardwood floor.

[02:08:07.070 --> 02:08:12.470]
My wife and my job, my kids and my car, off you don't my table.

[02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:14.970]
And I cut it to go.

[02:08:18.030 --> 02:08:23.030]
But sometimes I'm just painting up to keep a man like me.

[02:08:23.490 --> 02:08:29.090]
No way. No, I've got to go out of hell.

[02:08:29.390 --> 02:08:31.650]
But it's someone else's expense.

[02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:35.110]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:08:35.210 --> 02:08:39.130]
I drive really slow in the ultra fast lane.

[02:08:39.130 --> 02:08:43.150]
Well, people behind me are going insane.

[02:08:43.810 --> 02:08:46.250]
I'm an actor, you're the only one.

[02:08:47.150 --> 02:08:50.410]

I use public toilets and I piss on the seat.

[02:08:56.210 --> 02:08:59.750]

[02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:02.890]

[02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:32.790]
Ranting and raping and carrying on.

[02:09:33.490 --> 02:09:37.030]
Maybe they're right when they tell me I'm wrong.

[02:09:41.310 --> 02:09:45.410]
I'm an actor, you're the only one.

[02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:48.190]
I'm an actor, you're the only one.

[02:09:49.950 --> 02:09:51.190]
You know what I'm going to do?

[02:09:51.410 --> 02:09:53.030]
I'm going to get myself in 1967,

[02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:55.070]
and then I killed a rattle convertible.

[02:09:55.390 --> 02:09:57.890]
I think with a whale skin of a cat,

[02:09:58.230 --> 02:10:00.090]
and all other cow in the carrier,

[02:10:00.090 --> 02:10:02.570]
and being proud of baby's seal eyes, red headlights.

[02:10:02.790 --> 02:10:04.750]
Yeah, and I want to cry for round that baby,

[02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:06.490]
because at 115 miles per hour,

[02:10:06.530 --> 02:10:07.830]
she's getting one mom for gallons.

[02:10:08.110 --> 02:10:10.210]
The second half is not for to find a cheeseburgers McDonald's

[02:10:10.210 --> 02:10:12.610]
and the old fashioned not by the greatable styrofoam containers.

[02:10:12.990 --> 02:10:14.930]
And when I'm done sucking down those grease ball burgers,

[02:10:15.250 --> 02:10:17.110]
I'm like a white client mom for the American flag,

[02:10:17.330 --> 02:10:19.810]
and then I'm going to suck the styrofoam containers right off the side,

[02:10:19.970 --> 02:10:21.310]
and then I'm going to cut damn thing,

[02:10:21.410 --> 02:10:22.390]
and anybody can do it by the end.

[02:10:22.410 --> 02:10:23.150]
You know what I mean?

[02:10:23.150 --> 02:10:25.110]
Because we got the bomb, that's why.

[02:10:25.290 --> 02:10:27.350]
It's too words, nuclear fucking weapons.

[02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:29.810]
So, Jay, Russia, Germany, Romania,

[02:10:29.810 --> 02:10:31.550]
they can have all the democracy they want,

[02:10:31.670 --> 02:10:33.890]
and taking them a thick democracy cake walk right through the middle

[02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:34.690]
of the cinnamon square,

[02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:35.990]
and it won't make a lick of difference,

[02:10:36.110 --> 02:10:37.430]
because we ain't got the bomb.

[02:10:37.650 --> 02:10:39.470]
So, Jay, John Wayne's not in.

[02:10:39.690 --> 02:10:42.050]
He's frozen, and as soon as we find a cure for cancer,

[02:10:42.150 --> 02:10:43.070]
we're going to throw out that Duke,

[02:10:43.290 --> 02:10:44.390]
and he's going to be pretty pissed off.

[02:10:44.530 --> 02:10:44.930]
You know why?

[02:10:45.210 --> 02:10:46.430]
The Duke is taking a cold shower.

[02:10:46.610 --> 02:10:48.430]
We multiply that by 15 million times.

[02:10:48.610 --> 02:10:50.030]
That's how pissed off the Duke's going to be.

[02:10:50.210 --> 02:10:51.970]
I'm going to get a Duke, and John gets a head east,

[02:10:52.190 --> 02:10:54.710]
and Lee Marvin and Sam Decker are going to taste the race,

[02:10:55.090 --> 02:10:56.090]
and drive down a dexate.

[02:10:56.090 --> 02:10:57.870]
You know, you really aren't at home.

[02:10:58.010 --> 02:11:00.370]
I should just shut up and sing the song, but I...

[02:11:00.370 --> 02:11:00.870]
Come on F.

[02:11:01.250 --> 02:11:05.550]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:11:09.390 --> 02:11:16.230]
Fs, H.O., L.E., Everybody, Fs, S.O., L.E.

[02:11:28.290 --> 02:11:33.090]
I'm an asshole and I'm proud of it.

[02:11:38.290 --> 02:11:41.330]
Oh, that has really please go away.

[02:11:42.510 --> 02:11:48.890]
Find a new way to attack the Baco home and eat your whole home.

[02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:57.430]
Till you explode, just like your fat fat churn in ladies,

[02:11:58.010 --> 02:11:59.970]
have you bite your seats on a plane?

[02:12:01.270 --> 02:12:05.610]
He's filling your fingers that have yellow stain from sea toes.

[02:12:06.310 --> 02:12:07.470]
Can't see your toes.

[02:12:09.310 --> 02:12:15.950]
After picky puno, I have to be fat this gusting and tasty.

[02:12:19.650 --> 02:12:23.210]
You make the churn with women smile.

[02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:27.190]
They like a cow's spandid sassy.

[02:12:27.710 --> 02:12:30.690]
Think smelly, fat story pulse of a mile.

[02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:33.950]
Your body cheese smells like a grapple.

[02:12:35.170 --> 02:12:38.630]
After it was occupied by head, ask their dealers,

[02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:40.830]
you want to get into your car.

[02:12:40.830 --> 02:12:44.550]
I'm flustered to that M.Y.

[02:12:46.270 --> 02:12:51.510]
I can squeal, I can squeal, I can squeal fat lady.

[02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:54.190]
It's living with your loverless need.

[02:12:55.530 --> 02:12:59.390]
Slavering and starting the tree between her knees.

[02:12:59.870 --> 02:13:01.530]
That's my tail of yeast.

[02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:05.070]
It's most reaching to me.

[02:13:07.930 --> 02:13:09.950]
That's my tail of yeast and tasty.

[02:13:18.270 --> 02:13:20.590]
Shub those fat beads of my ass.

[02:13:20.990 --> 02:13:22.650]
Shub those fat beads of my ass.

[02:13:23.010 --> 02:13:26.750]
Make my fringal agon, and they go popping with one tongue on the string.

[02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:28.850]
Shub those fat beads of my ass.

[02:13:29.290 --> 02:13:30.870]
Shub those fat beads of my ass.

[02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:35.030]
I've appreciated it, lubricated with only, oh that's fine.

[02:13:35.550 --> 02:13:37.150]
Shub those fat beads of my ass.

[02:13:37.610 --> 02:13:39.190]
Shub those fat beads of my ass.

[02:13:39.690 --> 02:13:41.930]
Use that barger in to help slide a minute,

[02:13:42.290 --> 02:13:43.450]
it's easier that way.

[02:13:43.790 --> 02:13:47.590]
I want my ecstasy to last, so don't pull them out too fast.

[02:13:48.030 --> 02:13:51.830]
First you start out slowly and speed up only when the last one's about to pop.

[02:14:00.190 --> 02:14:02.270]
Shub those fat beads of my ass.

[02:14:02.450 --> 02:14:04.310]
Shub those fat beads of my ass.

[02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:08.530]
But don't tell nobody, nothing is funny and lack behind my back.

[02:14:08.950 --> 02:14:10.570]
Shub those fat beads of my ass.

[02:14:11.050 --> 02:14:12.670]
Shub those fat beads of my ass.

[02:14:13.150 --> 02:14:15.250]
It should be okay, no matter what I ate.

[02:14:15.530 --> 02:14:16.870]
Like reading in the gas.

[02:14:17.310 --> 02:14:18.950]
Shub those fat beads of my ass.

[02:14:19.270 --> 02:14:21.010]
Shub those fat beads of my ass.

[02:14:21.010 --> 02:14:22.890]
I've got a plastic all too.

[02:14:23.150 --> 02:14:25.610]
I have the all the catalytic again.

[02:14:43.370 --> 02:14:45.210]
Box new cellar.

[02:14:45.610 --> 02:14:47.770]
Oh really like to fuck you.

[02:14:48.430 --> 02:14:49.270]
Oh yeah.

[02:14:50.150 --> 02:14:51.270]
Box new cellar.

[02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:53.050]
Oh yeah.

[02:14:53.050 --> 02:14:54.630]
We really like to fuck you.

[02:14:55.130 --> 02:14:57.050]
We really like to fuck you.

[02:14:57.050 --> 02:15:00.450]
You're a fine looking fascist and a perfect little Nazi.

[02:15:01.090 --> 02:15:04.290]
I want to build their coffee through your soil panties.

[02:15:04.510 --> 02:15:05.430]
The starting news.

[02:15:05.650 --> 02:15:06.850]
Look you slug and sweet.

[02:15:07.630 --> 02:15:09.290]
Lamping your lips like hand.

[02:15:09.490 --> 02:15:10.450]
Cultures roast me.

[02:15:11.130 --> 02:15:12.430]
Box new cellar.

[02:15:12.810 --> 02:15:13.670]
Oh yeah.

[02:15:13.670 --> 02:15:15.210]
We really like to fuck you.

[02:15:15.890 --> 02:15:16.650]
Oh yeah.

[02:15:16.650 --> 02:15:16.850]
Box new cellar.

[02:15:16.850 --> 02:15:16.850]

[02:15:17.810 --> 02:15:19.290]
Box new cellar.

[02:15:19.410 --> 02:15:20.450]
Oh yeah.

[02:15:20.450 --> 02:15:20.450]

[02:15:20.450 --> 02:15:20.510]
Oh yeah.

[02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:22.030]
We really like to fuck you.

[02:15:22.690 --> 02:15:24.610]
We really like to fuck you.

[02:15:25.670 --> 02:15:27.370]
You ever think about doing kind of listen?

[02:15:27.710 --> 02:15:28.670]
Do you bitch?

[02:15:29.850 --> 02:15:31.790]
You wanna come to me?

[02:15:31.950 --> 02:15:32.270]
Three way.

[02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:34.750]
You're not a single man.

[02:15:35.770 --> 02:15:36.890]
You should be able to come out.

[02:15:37.890 --> 02:15:41.350]
The little pink rose put me between your buns.

[02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:44.530]
I'll bet it tastes like bubble gum.

[02:15:44.530 --> 02:15:48.030]
See you next time you need a story done.

[02:15:48.450 --> 02:15:51.810]
Since it takes a little bit more to make you come.

[02:15:52.350 --> 02:15:53.610]
Box new cellar.

[02:15:54.130 --> 02:15:56.490]
We really like to fuck you.

[02:15:57.090 --> 02:15:57.770]
Oh yeah.

[02:15:58.870 --> 02:16:00.530]
Box new cellar.

[02:16:00.990 --> 02:16:03.150]
We really like to fuck you.

[02:16:04.410 --> 02:16:05.330]
Hi Felicia.

[02:16:05.710 --> 02:16:07.010]
Gini, I love your dress.

[02:16:07.330 --> 02:16:09.270]
And your hair looks so shiny and manageable.

[02:16:09.730 --> 02:16:12.070]
Are you still shampooing with head and shoulders?

[02:16:12.670 --> 02:16:13.510]
Gosh, chick.

[02:16:13.890 --> 02:16:16.150]
I stopped using head and shoulders a long time ago.

[02:16:16.630 --> 02:16:19.190]
I mean, honestly, who grows hair on their shoulders anyway?

[02:16:19.690 --> 02:16:20.450]
Yeah, right.

[02:16:20.770 --> 02:16:22.350]
So what are you using now?

[02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:26.110]
Well, it's like head and shoulders only without all those additives.

[02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:27.710]
It's just called head.

[02:16:28.290 --> 02:16:29.510]
Let's tell them about it, girls.

[02:16:30.590 --> 02:16:34.030]
If you're tired of your own shampoo, yeah, yeah,

[02:16:34.170 --> 02:16:35.850]
rub a brain in and be lazy.

[02:16:36.490 --> 02:16:39.470]
Yeah, yeah, just remember what I said.

[02:16:39.470 --> 02:16:42.790]
Yeah, yeah, feel better if you get some head.

[02:16:42.990 --> 02:16:45.330]
Wow, where can I get head?

[02:16:45.610 --> 02:16:46.650]
Lots of places, chick.

[02:16:46.930 --> 02:16:50.750]
You can stop by my place later and I'll be happy to give you a head.

[02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:53.390]
In 15 minutes, I'll have you shampooed,

[02:16:53.490 --> 02:16:55.190]
styled, and blown dry.

[02:16:55.470 --> 02:16:57.250]
Gee, you don't miss a lick, do you?

[02:16:57.590 --> 02:16:59.810]
Head sound great, but is it expensive?

[02:17:00.430 --> 02:17:01.310]
Not at all, chick.

[02:17:01.650 --> 02:17:05.950]
My brother says there are places downtown where you can get head for less than $10.

[02:17:06.710 --> 02:17:09.630]
Golly, at that price, everyone should be getting head.

[02:17:10.050 --> 02:17:10.750]
That's right, chick.

[02:17:11.090 --> 02:17:12.970]
When you say head, you set a mouthful.

[02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:14.690]
Hi, I'm Dr. Raymond Foulade.

[02:17:14.890 --> 02:17:15.910]
I'm from Freedom All Industries.

[02:17:16.410 --> 02:17:16.950]
Here to kill you.

[02:17:17.130 --> 02:17:18.070]
Why, you should get head.

[02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:20.750]
First, it lubricates each limp hair follicle,

[02:17:21.050 --> 02:17:22.370]
leading in a wreck, listening shaft.

[02:17:22.850 --> 02:17:25.210]
Then the scalp's natural oils are sucked out of the root,

[02:17:25.550 --> 02:17:27.790]
leading your hair soft, shiny, and exhausted.

[02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:29.630]
Nothing does the job like head.

[02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:30.330]
Great.

[02:17:30.850 --> 02:17:32.790]
Can I get head from my hairdresser, Bruce?

[02:17:32.790 --> 02:17:36.410]
Probably, but you might want to try your girlfriend first.

[02:17:37.310 --> 02:17:39.430]
So I'm in the head today.

[02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:42.770]
Yeah, yeah, little squirt, throw them all away.

[02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:46.030]
Yeah, yeah, you look better and you'll feel terrific.

[02:17:46.510 --> 02:17:49.330]
Yeah, yeah, when you get head, you're a lucky step.

[02:17:50.090 --> 02:17:53.530]
One hair with lots of volume, nothing gets it up like head.

[02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:56.130]
Available at a price you won't find hard to swallow,

[02:17:56.370 --> 02:17:58.230]
and it's going down every day.

[02:18:00.410 --> 02:18:02.670]
Connie, we're out of shampoo.

[02:18:03.370 --> 02:18:04.950]
Can you go out and get some head?

[02:18:05.650 --> 02:18:06.250]
What did you say?

[02:18:06.770 --> 02:18:10.450]
I said I want you to go out and get head.

[02:18:10.770 --> 02:18:12.230]
Oh, thank you, sweet Jesus.

[02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:14.410]
I'm going down down.

[02:18:15.290 --> 02:18:17.250]
And head makes a great holiday gift.

[02:18:17.810 --> 02:18:19.910]
Last Christmas, my wife gave me some head.

[02:18:20.390 --> 02:18:21.690]
Then I gave her a pearl necklace.

[02:18:22.110 --> 02:18:23.930]
I've never seen her so choked up.

[02:18:24.290 --> 02:18:26.730]
My girlfriend used to give me head, then we got married.

[02:18:26.730 --> 02:18:30.070]
Now I'm lucky if I get Jurgens lotion and a national Jew wrap.

[02:18:31.350 --> 02:18:34.190]
When she starts to pull one out of the top,

[02:18:34.210 --> 02:18:35.530]
I can't feel the clutch.

[02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:38.910]
I throw your top in head in the shower.

[02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:43.550]
You want a thumb in head, the long, the long, the long, the long.

[02:18:44.510 --> 02:18:46.670]
If you buy it up, you're full of shampoo.

[02:18:47.110 --> 02:18:49.990]
Yeah, yeah, right, straight it, and feeling blue.

[02:18:50.410 --> 02:18:53.170]
Yeah, yeah, let's remember what I said.

[02:18:53.630 --> 02:18:55.110]
Yeah, yeah, it'll feel better.

You can try anything on the store before you buy it

Try the new low-car bread. It's called simply low-car bread

[02:23:16.930 --> 02:23:18.830]
Just spread on some of that new La Nuba jam

The V5s present

[02:24:19.350 --> 02:24:20.590]
This is Suncraft

[02:24:21.350 --> 02:24:23.730]
I've been watching you doing that

[02:24:23.730 --> 02:24:25.530]
Macarena on television

[02:24:28.310 --> 02:24:30.950]

[02:24:31.730 --> 02:24:34.670]
I would like to demonstrate for you

[02:24:37.050 --> 02:24:39.990]

[02:24:58.510 --> 02:24:59.390]
I can't believe it

[02:24:59.390 --> 02:25:01.170]
I can't believe it

[02:25:01.170 --> 02:25:04.630]
I can't believe it

[02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:06.990]
When your alarm goes off in the morning

[02:25:06.990 --> 02:25:07.670]
Macarena

[02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:11.650]

Like your hearty nails

[02:25:29.470 --> 02:25:31.910]
Sunny junky jokes on electricity

[02:25:33.450 --> 02:25:34.290]
They call

[02:25:34.290 --> 02:25:36.950]
And bring till they pass out

[02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:39.470]
As a sure-of-favorite poor daddy

[02:25:39.470 --> 02:25:41.730]
They get high

[02:25:41.730 --> 02:25:45.450]
And almost anything they can

[02:25:45.450 --> 02:25:47.210]
Girls are guys

[02:25:47.210 --> 02:25:48.850]
They sprint their gown

[02:25:48.850 --> 02:25:51.030]
They're the frames

[02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:52.710]
And a fresh lad

[02:25:54.830 --> 02:25:57.550]
Girls are bare

[02:25:57.550 --> 02:26:00.870]
She makes you mad

[02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:02.650]
Thinking he grew up

[02:26:02.650 --> 02:26:04.890]
He is slowly getting up

[02:26:04.890 --> 02:26:05.110]
Here comes everyone

[02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.110]

[02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.110]

[02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.110]

[02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:06.290]
All right high did vote around

[02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:07.410]
You heard his Wave?

[02:26:07.530 --> 02:26:09.110]
This is what we understand

[02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:20.550]

[02:26:46.890 --> 02:26:54.390]
He, he, he grow, pulling foul be a right wing shlaw

[02:26:54.390 --> 02:26:58.050]
Shining the shoes of white man bush

[02:26:58.050 --> 02:27:01.770]
Pulling foul is the masses he grows

[02:27:01.770 --> 02:27:05.870]
Spreads his cheeks to his, his, his, toosh

[02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:09.690]
Pulling foul is the masses he grows

[02:27:09.690 --> 02:27:14.350]
Stepping in fetch and at the whim of his white man's fur

[02:27:14.350 --> 02:27:17.730]
Pulling foul is the masses he grows

[02:27:17.730 --> 02:27:21.750]
He goes through the knees of the globalist crackers

[02:27:22.370 --> 02:27:25.490]
Pulling foul is the masses he grows

[02:27:25.490 --> 02:27:29.450]
And on growth comes some survey uncool

[02:27:29.450 --> 02:27:33.430]
Pulling foul is the masses he grows

[02:27:33.430 --> 02:27:37.490]
A twist like say, put lips up

[02:27:37.490 --> 02:27:41.690]
Pulling foul is the masses he grows

[02:27:41.690 --> 02:27:45.830]
Yo, pulling big, pulling big, pulling big, pulling big

[02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:48.030]
A slave, knee, knee, he grow

[02:27:49.750 --> 02:27:52.850]
Pulling foul is the old, that what he'd be doing

[02:28:00.650 --> 02:28:03.510]
He's kind of going sweet as daddy

[02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:06.370]
He ever scored it a lot of cocaine

[02:28:09.250 --> 02:28:16.430]
He said that it's not true that it's ever used cocaine

[02:28:18.130 --> 02:28:22.130]
George is eyes when he delights that he tries

[02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:23.870]
Yes, cocaine

[02:28:31.330 --> 02:28:33.810]
What's the republic in shape?

[02:28:34.110 --> 02:28:37.070]
In an attempt to save his campaign

[02:28:40.430 --> 02:28:42.670]
He said he's pure as a saint

[02:28:42.670 --> 02:28:45.910]
And he would never play with cocaine

[02:28:49.110 --> 02:28:52.810]
George is eyes when he delights that he tries

[02:28:53.930 --> 02:28:54.450]
Okay

[02:29:04.750 --> 02:29:07.210]
What a hell of my always getting raped by men

[02:29:07.210 --> 02:29:08.770]
You have a nice back mow

[02:29:08.770 --> 02:29:11.510]
But I don't ever get raped by broads of this

[02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:12.690]
Women don't write men

[02:29:12.690 --> 02:29:14.170]
And it's too bad that it is

[02:29:14.170 --> 02:29:16.850]
There is such a thing as an attractive man, you know

[02:29:16.850 --> 02:29:17.550]
Mow

[02:29:17.550 --> 02:29:19.210]
What do you know, you're crumb?

[02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:20.650]
What do you some kind of fairy?

[02:29:21.090 --> 02:29:23.510]
What are you going to go for your other monkey footy or can grind it down a hole?

[02:29:24.090 --> 02:29:25.310]
I'm not a queen here

[02:29:25.310 --> 02:29:27.330]
What do you know about being queer you moron?

[02:29:27.530 --> 02:29:28.950]
I've been raped enough to know the difference

[02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:30.250]
Sorry, Mow, dad

[02:29:30.250 --> 02:29:33.010]
Now see here, we're supposed to be talking about sports here

[02:29:33.010 --> 02:29:34.290]
Not about good looking men

[02:29:34.290 --> 02:29:36.230]
Just men in general and nothing else

[02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:38.970]
This is sports radio over here, we love men

[02:29:38.970 --> 02:29:39.250]
Dad

[02:29:39.250 --> 02:29:40.790]
But I got to say you have a bird

[02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:43.790]
I just the other night I saw this commercial on overnight TV

[02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:46.130]
When this guy was crawling out at the ocean see

[02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:49.530]
On this island filled with strippers that are broads

[02:29:49.530 --> 02:29:50.430]
They looked okay

[02:29:50.430 --> 02:29:55.830]
But this guy in the commercial I would say in an objective sort of way

[02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:57.490]
He was pretty cute

[02:29:59.630 --> 02:30:00.690]
You got your laugh

[02:30:00.690 --> 02:30:03.510]
You laugh and did I get you clearance to laugh?

[02:30:03.890 --> 02:30:05.570]
Was this for a scriptuate mow?

[02:30:05.930 --> 02:30:06.410]
Yeah

[02:30:06.410 --> 02:30:08.530]
And the guy was crawling on the island

[02:30:08.530 --> 02:30:09.750]
You thought he was cute?

[02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:10.570]
Yeah, that's right

[02:30:10.570 --> 02:30:12.250]
Are you asked me to be objective?

[02:30:12.610 --> 02:30:14.690]
I agree us and you still make fun of me

[02:30:14.690 --> 02:30:16.430]
You want to get fired again?

[02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:16.830]
Ah!

[02:30:17.170 --> 02:30:19.410]
That guy there had pinchable jowls

[02:30:19.410 --> 02:30:21.410]
A croke with hookah damn funny

[02:30:21.410 --> 02:30:23.250]
That was George

[02:30:23.250 --> 02:30:24.210]
Ah!

[02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:26.350]
That was George

[02:30:26.350 --> 02:30:27.710]
You're gonna grind us monkey?

[02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:34.830]
You know, maybe I am in love with that mango munchy to speak

[02:30:34.830 --> 02:30:39.590]
He certainly does make a thing with my nose glow like a neon rainbow

[02:30:41.530 --> 02:30:45.330]
Wanting who fired must have been just the reaction of the suppressor truth about A.B.

[02:30:45.690 --> 02:30:49.630]
But I can't let anybody know how much I've wanted after his voice

[02:30:50.430 --> 02:30:52.430]
Get out of here, holy, you're all nuts!

[02:30:52.850 --> 02:30:53.750]
You're all...

[02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:55.470]
Hey, I can't move

[02:30:55.470 --> 02:30:57.830]
Look at the bulging your pants, mow

[02:30:57.830 --> 02:31:00.750]
Oh no, if I'd move the wrong way I'll...

[02:31:01.290 --> 02:31:03.550]
Hey everybody, mow mess this pants

[02:31:16.310 --> 02:31:17.270]
It was sensational

[02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:18.050]
I need a nap

[02:31:18.530 --> 02:31:22.410]
Jane's got a great line, one of our regular faxers Jane, our loyal listener in 4 Lauderdale

[02:31:22.410 --> 02:31:26.290]

Be a revealing a thing

And siting clean each and eyes

[02:33:13.810 --> 02:33:16.630]
He was bending his spine

Be a revealing a thing

[02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:23.090]
Be a revealing a thing

[02:33:23.090 --> 02:33:26.470]
No, he was out when he had the day

[02:33:26.470 --> 02:33:29.850]
Your choice you back when he was a kid

[02:33:29.850 --> 02:33:33.090]
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo, it was his favorite day

[02:33:33.090 --> 02:33:36.050]
Your choice you'll be a warning club, hey

[02:33:36.050 --> 02:33:39.930]
He wants the White House to be all here

[02:33:39.930 --> 02:33:42.090]
Like a big shot switch guy

[02:33:43.150 --> 02:33:46.850]
So he can't admit he feels like Spurs

[02:33:46.850 --> 02:33:50.550]
Lord, what the best hide on a pizza, ha ha

[02:33:51.650 --> 02:33:53.290]
That's the way it was

[02:33:53.290 --> 02:33:56.910]
You have a no-full of cover, he denies it today

[02:33:56.910 --> 02:34:00.730]
George, for you, you'll never get it to say

[02:34:00.730 --> 02:34:03.690]
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo, it was his favorite day

[02:34:03.690 --> 02:34:05.550]
Your choice you'll be a warning club

[02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:11.050]
Tonight on America, under the covers, we love it actor Bob Greene

[02:34:11.050 --> 02:34:13.130]
And the women he wouldn't judge

[02:34:13.130 --> 02:34:15.050]
Hello, I'm Bill Curtis

[02:34:15.050 --> 02:34:18.390]
Join me tonight as I wave my hands about uncontrollably

[02:34:19.870 --> 02:34:23.370]
And tell you about the women Bob Greene would not touch

[02:34:23.370 --> 02:34:26.050]
And if he were still alive, the women he would not touch today

[02:34:26.050 --> 02:34:30.390]
Starting with Anna Nicole, who even I wouldn't touch with Bob Greene's thing

[02:34:30.390 --> 02:34:34.690]
Not to mention Sandra Bernhardt, Courtney Love, Pam Anderson, or Anne Coker

[02:34:34.690 --> 02:34:37.490]
I wouldn't touch any of those gangs with Bob Greene's thing

[02:34:37.490 --> 02:34:40.410]
Bob Greene himself turned down the likes of B-Aunt her

[02:34:40.410 --> 02:34:43.430]
Ruth Mulley, Billas Diller, Alice Gosley, Tody Fields

[02:34:43.430 --> 02:34:47.250]
Bob's mainly, and Joanne Worley, who once played his wife on TV

[02:34:47.250 --> 02:34:49.450]
My hands are moving wildly now

[02:34:49.450 --> 02:34:51.330]
Oh, I'm starting to dance

[02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:57.730]
Bob Greene, the women he would not judge, tonight on America, under the covers

[02:34:57.730 --> 02:35:01.430]
Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan

[02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:20.640]
Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, I'm going on my knees

[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:23.480]
So I can wear and watch

[02:35:24.820 --> 02:35:26.820]
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

[02:35:26.820 --> 02:35:30.360]
On the bus, lim, lim, lim, lim, lim, all the way

[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:33.780]
I pray for vehicles that will pick the USA

[02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:38.600]
My allegiance says that you must like

[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:42.680]
In the sky, on your next slide

[02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:44.980]
I want you to die today

[02:35:44.980 --> 02:35:49.220]
I'm Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, Allah is proud of me

[02:35:49.220 --> 02:35:52.740]
Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan, I find a brainlessly

[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:18.960]
Good luck for you, flap

[02:36:22.740 --> 02:36:23.580]
Aaaaah!

[02:36:27.140 --> 02:36:28.200]
Aaaaah!

[02:36:28.220 --> 02:36:29.140]
Aaaaah!

[02:36:29.220 --> 02:36:29.920]
Aaaaah!

[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:30.880]
Aaaaah!

[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:31.560]
Aaaaah!

[02:36:34.740 --> 02:36:35.100]
Aaaaah!

[02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:37.480]
Aaaaah!

[02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:40.740]
Baby, I want you a couple of missiles.

[02:36:41.420 --> 02:36:41.720]
Oh!

[02:36:42.140 --> 02:36:44.100]
Toward a place we know

[02:36:44.740 --> 02:36:47.640]
And a aim on that of fella

[02:36:47.640 --> 02:36:51.020]
Whose first name begins with a...

[02:36:51.020 --> 02:36:51.740]
Ooooooh!

[02:36:51.740 --> 02:36:56.020]
There's one thing we all understand

[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:01.840]
How cater won't be finished

[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:04.620]
Until we blow up Pakistan

[02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:10.240]
We could chase him round forever

[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:13.900]
With our tanks and all our troops

[02:37:13.900 --> 02:37:17.300]
But special forces are so tired

[02:37:17.300 --> 02:37:20.920]
Of jumping through them moves

[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:25.760]
You'd go and we'd need another plane

[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:30.880]
So let's cut out all the nonsense

[02:37:30.880 --> 02:37:34.060]
And go blow up Pakistan

[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:41.880]
How cater needs a nuclear tank

[02:37:43.540 --> 02:37:46.640]
And why don't we stop pussyfoot

[02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:51.620]
And go blow up Pakistan

[02:37:57.920 --> 02:37:59.420]
Bum, bum

[02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:04.040]
And then the Lord said

[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:07.420]
Let there be light and low

[02:38:07.420 --> 02:38:10.860]
There was light from the same people

[02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:13.960]
Who brought you the much beloved talking Bible

[02:38:14.860 --> 02:38:16.520]
Comes a new 10 volume set

[02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:19.140]
Brilliantly updated for the 80s

[02:38:19.140 --> 02:38:22.540]
Yes, it's the wrapping Bible

[02:38:22.540 --> 02:38:24.720]
There was dark everywhere

[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:25.800]
Then the man said

[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:27.100]
Light was there

[02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:29.480]
I've done good, there's no doubt

[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:32.380]
On the seventh day he just chilled out

[02:38:32.380 --> 02:38:34.060]
Genesis, Genesis

[02:38:34.860 --> 02:38:36.920]
Beginning of that, beginning of this

[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:38.900]
Finally the good book is that

[02:38:38.900 --> 02:38:40.660]
And his word is that

[02:38:40.660 --> 02:38:43.140]
Check it out, there's a cow called Sodom

[02:38:43.140 --> 02:38:46.340]
And the woman, everybody bloody black and low tomorrow

[02:38:46.900 --> 02:38:48.760]
God looked down, said, now my fault

[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:51.280]
Don't look back or you turn to song

[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:52.480]
That's white, triple-peat

[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:55.760]
Started to freak, the cow came up and linked to a cheek

[02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:56.900]
Take a lick, y'all

[02:38:56.900 --> 02:38:58.200]
I want you, y'all

[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:01.400]
Imagine all the songs, all the parables

[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:03.120]
Every sacred biblical word

[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:06.600]
Interpreted by the finest soccer MCs of all time

[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:08.720]
Genesis, Genesis

[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:11.000]
Turn around

[02:39:12.460 --> 02:39:13.980]
The wrapping Bible

[02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:16.480]
Making his word fresh again

[02:39:18.140 --> 02:39:21.320]
When a story is too big for the other cable news channels

[02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:25.840]
Only one man is big enough to break it down in this scrumptious little sound bites

[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:28.700]
It's Fatman on MSNBC

[02:39:28.700 --> 02:39:30.340]
Hi, I'm Jerry Fatman

[02:39:30.340 --> 02:39:33.240]
Tonight we'll seek our teeth into the problems on Wall Street

[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:35.800]
But first I want to get this double dog down

[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:40.400]
Oh, damn, I ate a wrapper again

[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:44.220]
We've nights at 70's, Jerry Fatman devours the issues of the day

[02:39:44.220 --> 02:39:45.680]
Like the Middle East

[02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:47.860]
These Palestinians can blow up buses

[02:39:47.860 --> 02:39:49.280]
They can blow up schools

[02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:51.760]
But when they start blowing up delis

[02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:53.920]
That's when America needs to get involved

[02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:55.840]
Fatman on MSNBC

[02:39:55.840 --> 02:39:59.360]
The new show that can only be filmed in wide-screen

[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:03.560]
I'm Jerry Fatman, tonight we'll have a round table discussion with Mr. Sulti

[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:04.360]
Mr. Pee-Not

[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:08.480]
This is Butterworth, Fetty Crocker, and a special medical report from Dr. Pepper

[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:10.740]
That's tonight on the next Fatman

[02:40:10.740 --> 02:40:12.340]
Right here on the Food Network

[02:40:12.340 --> 02:40:14.240]
Jerry, this is MSNBC

[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:16.760]
Right, you're going to finish those chips

[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:18.200]
Let's go, I'm also going to mine

[02:40:18.200 --> 02:40:20.480]
Let's go Fatman, they're here

[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:26.200]
Can you make it, can you make it, can you make it, can you make it

[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:38.420]
Can you make it, can you make it, can you make it, can you make it, can you make it

[02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:44.020]
Can the Hague and Berthens and the Shug and Berthens and the Keler and the Keg

[02:40:44.020 --> 02:40:47.660]
If you know, I'm a woman, I'm a Jesus, I'm straight in

[02:40:47.660 --> 02:40:54.360]
Rasta me, Rasta you, Rasta black, Rasta you

[02:40:55.720 --> 02:41:00.340]
Rasta you, hey, Rasta you

[02:41:02.140 --> 02:41:04.880]
I say I and I

[02:41:06.020 --> 02:41:07.960]
I see who you are

[02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:11.800]
Hey, how come you don't wear jet-lots

[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:14.540]
I'm not that off the top

[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:21.220]
I like Jimmy Cliff and I like that Smokashtrip

[02:41:22.180 --> 02:41:24.740]
I like Mansu, right?

[02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:28.180]
I am my greatest type of guy

[02:41:28.180 --> 02:41:35.180]
Rasta me, Rasta you, Rasta black, Rasta you

[02:41:36.180 --> 02:41:41.360]
Rasta you, Rasta you

[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:48.300]
I like gochetsho, and I like the motorbike

[02:41:49.500 --> 02:41:52.680]
Chicken soup with honey, the luck

[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:57.840]
That's what I like, and have you ever tasted?

[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:01.980]
Crack fish, crack fish, cranks

[02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:06.080]
Blinding and giving filter fish

[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:09.300]
That's much more my speed

[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:15.720]
Rasta me, Rasta you, Rasta black, Rasta you

[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:22.220]
Rasta you, I want me tell you, Rasta you

[02:42:33.620 --> 02:42:44.400]
Hey, hang over here

[02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:50.760]
I'll just hang over here

[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:56.240]
I'll just hang over here

[02:42:56.240 --> 02:42:57.820]
Aw NaIK

[02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:27.080]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:56.480]
oh, oh, oh your aquesta noticing,

[02:43:57.400 --> 02:43:58.900]
National Brotherhood Week,

[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:01.560]
Lean on a horn and Sheriff Clark

[02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:03.900]
Are dancing cheap to cheekers

[02:44:03.900 --> 02:44:08.080]
Fun to nulagize the people you despise

[02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:11.180]
As long as you don't let them in your school

[02:44:13.940 --> 02:44:16.900]
Oh the poor folks, hate the rich folks

[02:44:16.900 --> 02:44:19.220]
And the rich folks, hate the poor folks

[02:44:19.220 --> 02:44:21.420]
All of my folks, hate all of your folks

[02:44:21.420 --> 02:44:24.100]
It's American as apple pie, but during

[02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:26.280]
National Brotherhood Week

[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:28.680]
Hello! National Brotherhood Week,

[02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:31.560]
New Yorkers love the poise or weekends

[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:32.960]
Cause it's very chic

[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:35.740]
Step up and shake the hand of

[02:44:35.740 --> 02:44:40.680]
Someone you can't stand, you can tolerate them if you try

[02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:46.340]
Oh the Protestants, hate the Catholics

[02:44:46.340 --> 02:44:48.820]
And the Catholics, hate the Protestants

[02:44:48.820 --> 02:44:50.740]
And the Hindus, hate the Muslims

[02:44:50.740 --> 02:44:53.580]
And everybody hates the Jews, but during

[02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:55.800]
National Brotherhood Week,

[02:44:56.940 --> 02:44:58.200]
National Brotherhood Week,

[02:44:58.500 --> 02:45:00.440]
It's National Everyone's Smile,

[02:45:00.620 --> 02:45:02.640]
Last One, and Other Hood Week,

[02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:05.240]
Feed Nice to People Who Are

[02:45:05.240 --> 02:45:07.100]
In Furrier To You,

[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:08.680]
It's Only For A Week,

[02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:10.080]
So Have No Fear

[02:45:10.920 --> 02:45:12.840]
Oh right, Be Grateful Light,

[02:45:12.980 --> 02:45:14.720]
It Doesn't Last For A year

[02:45:16.980 --> 02:45:17.860]
126, 56,

[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:18.560]
You know, you can hear them,

[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:19.560]
The Mad Dog at one hand,

[02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:21.120]
You can treat them, we got, what do we got?

[02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:22.440]
We got her a cool, and a hotline?

[02:45:22.440 --> 02:45:24.200]
No, it's, uh, I'm on a wrong day.

[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:25.500]
Oh that's for the Panther Game,

[02:45:25.580 --> 02:45:26.620]
The Shifko Panther Preview,

[02:45:26.860 --> 02:45:27.860]
At 7 o'clock,

[02:45:28.060 --> 02:45:29.260]
Panthers in a Pac-1 730,

[02:45:29.680 --> 02:45:30.960]
Any K from GA after the game,

[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:32.260]
And Joe and Mark overnight,

[02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:33.180]
Joe's very wounded,

[02:45:33.340 --> 02:45:35.280]
That Boca Brian won't spend at least two grand

[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:35.980]
A flying first class,

[02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:37.580]
The Vegas, and then bring a nice gift to his wedding,

[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:39.080]
Joe's very upset about that.

[02:45:39.760 --> 02:45:41.000]
I'll tell you guys, it's not upset,

[02:45:41.180 --> 02:45:42.040]
Who's always happy,

[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:43.100]
Who can weather the storm,

[02:45:43.260 --> 02:45:43.920]
Come rain or shine,

[02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:45.260]
A matter who wins the elections,

[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:45.940]
Tom Layman,

[02:45:46.500 --> 02:45:47.120]
At Halopone,

[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:48.780]
That's why they've been around for 35 years,

[02:45:49.040 --> 02:45:50.700]
Cause Tom kind of like goes with the flow,

[02:45:51.060 --> 02:45:51.660]
And he also,

[02:45:51.820 --> 02:45:52.840]
Oh, if don't mention the flow,

[02:45:53.020 --> 02:45:53.140]
Flow,

[02:45:53.260 --> 02:45:53.280]
Flow,

[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:53.780]
Brominees,

[02:45:53.780 --> 02:45:54.280]
And I say,

[02:45:54.700 --> 02:45:54.940]
Oh,

[02:45:55.140 --> 02:45:55.420]
Balloons,

[02:45:55.560 --> 02:45:55.880]
That's beautiful.

[02:45:56.140 --> 02:45:57.020]
Yeah, thanks, Flow.

[02:45:57.540 --> 02:45:58.420]
Or was it Mindy?

[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:00.240]
Anyway,

[02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:01.760]
The Big Near Rogers deal is going on,

[02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:02.600]

[02:46:05.460 --> 02:46:05.880]

Old Near Rogers,

[02:46:06.900 --> 02:46:07.360]
Say, Hey Near,

[02:46:07.380 --> 02:46:08.060]
Is getting older, never,

[02:46:08.220 --> 02:46:08.520]
And they'll say,

[02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:09.360]
All right, here's the next,

[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:10.460]
Extra discount.

[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:12.560]
Halopone X GMC,

[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:13.160]
At 134,

[02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:13.980]
One South Dixie,

[02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:15.440]
Highway, US 1 across from the falls,

[02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:16.560]
Tech the complete line,

[02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:17.720]
A great GMC SUV,

[02:46:17.900 --> 02:46:18.440]
Is including that,

[02:46:20.700 --> 02:46:21.260]
And it says SUV,

[02:46:21.460 --> 02:46:21.820]
The year in the old,

[02:46:21.900 --> 02:46:22.280]
Vibes,

[02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:22.600]
SUV,

[02:46:22.840 --> 02:46:24.080]
With the power of a sports car,

[02:46:24.340 --> 02:46:25.580]
When you stop down to Halopone X,

[02:46:25.700 --> 02:46:25.980]
By the way,

[02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:26.740]
Get a hold of Tom Laman,

[02:46:26.860 --> 02:46:27.420]
And whisper in his ear,

[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:28.080]
Neal says,

[02:46:28.220 --> 02:46:29.340]
You guys got the worst copies

[02:46:29.340 --> 02:46:30.260]
Ever seen in his life,

[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:31.680]
And that covers a lot of territory too.

[02:46:32.100 --> 02:46:34.120]
Halop's also got a stupidest selection of dependable,

[02:46:34.460 --> 02:46:34.980]
Used cars,

[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:36.080]
Trucks and SUVs,

[02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:37.560]
And like I always say,

[02:46:37.700 --> 02:46:38.280]
Why do I always say,

[02:46:38.340 --> 02:46:39.580]
Because it's very important to you,

[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:40.680]
Because we have a lot of deadbeats,

[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:41.280]
Listen to the show,

[02:46:41.380 --> 02:46:42.100]
Because the show is free.

[02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:43.740]
But if you're one of those people

[02:46:43.740 --> 02:46:45.300]
Who just can't get credit for lover money,

[02:46:45.660 --> 02:46:46.640]
They'll cut you deal somehow,

[02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:48.000]
Someway at Halopone X.

[02:46:48.260 --> 02:46:50.040]
So get you the Neal Rogers deal going on,

[02:46:50.180 --> 02:46:51.700]
Right now at Halopone X GMC,

[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:52.880]
Right across from the falls,

[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:53.580]
And they prestigious,

[02:46:53.780 --> 02:46:54.660]
Highly congested,

[02:46:54.660 --> 02:46:55.380]
South Dixie Highway,

[02:46:55.380 --> 02:46:56.100]
Open every day,

[02:46:56.440 --> 02:46:57.180]
Seven days a week,

[02:46:57.340 --> 02:46:57.940]
You can give them a call at

[02:46:57.940 --> 02:47:00.060]
305-238-4040.

[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:00.460]
So, you know,

[02:47:00.740 --> 02:47:01.380]
Pick up that phone,

[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:04.040]

[02:47:07.220 --> 02:47:07.600]
Professional Grade.

[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:10.060]
The life in the old,

[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:12.580]
We're sports radio 5 CC,

[02:47:13.500 --> 02:47:13.980]
UAM.

[02:47:15.780 --> 02:47:18.160]
Ishted with the sewer of this place.

[02:48:13.980 --> 02:48:14.280]
I'm like,

[02:48:14.380 --> 02:48:16.300]
You should devote all your time to it.

[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:17.260]
And I'll just,

[02:48:17.580 --> 02:48:19.360]
Well, I'll stay home, you know.

[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:20.780]
Ha, ha, ha,

[02:48:21.140 --> 02:48:22.760]
I'll take care of things.

[02:48:23.380 --> 02:48:24.780]
Like, in care of business.

[02:48:25.140 --> 02:48:25.440]
Ha, ha,

[02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:27.220]
I'm a BTL player, man.

[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:28.220]
Ha, ha, ha.

[02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:31.580]
This Hillary Burlock in Seoul

[02:48:31.580 --> 02:48:33.960]
Is the damn thing I ever saw.

[02:48:34.260 --> 02:48:36.520]
Your run's with the little goofy talk.

[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:38.180]
As soon as you never have him,

[02:48:38.460 --> 02:48:40.320]
In New York, so change your mind,

[02:48:40.420 --> 02:48:41.160]
Running in Illinois.

[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:41.780]
Hey, hey, hey,

[02:48:41.820 --> 02:48:43.340]
We don't believe that you're a Yiki fan.

[02:48:43.340 --> 02:48:46.060]
No sign, we don't beat you in bad democrats.

[02:48:46.860 --> 02:48:48.280]
Hillary Burlock in Seoul.

[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:50.540]
Hey, show you, L.A.

[02:48:50.780 --> 02:48:51.360]
All Y.

[02:48:52.260 --> 02:48:53.840]
Hillary, Hillary.

[02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:05.460]
The temperature is zero.

[02:49:08.980 --> 02:49:10.220]
It is cold.

[02:49:11.100 --> 02:49:13.420]
It is so freaking cold.

[02:49:15.660 --> 02:49:20.200]
And I cringe every time the wind blows.

[02:49:22.140 --> 02:49:23.440]
In my pants,

[02:49:24.900 --> 02:49:26.660]
Something is shrinking.

[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:30.940]
I'm so cold I can't

[02:49:31.440 --> 02:49:32.660]
Lick sink.

[02:49:36.140 --> 02:49:39.000]
That's because it's zero baby.

[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:45.860]
And I cannot feel my thoughts.

[02:49:48.340 --> 02:49:52.180]
There's a tingling in my fingers.

[02:49:54.260 --> 02:49:58.900]
And my pride that parts are frozen.

[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:08.080]
Oh, my nose is about to fall off.

[02:50:10.220 --> 02:50:14.360]
There's a cloud every time that I call.

[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:17.320]
And my hands are blue.

[02:50:18.820 --> 02:50:20.560]
They are turning numb.

[02:50:22.440 --> 02:50:25.640]
They might ampute it.

[02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:27.380]
My thoughts.

[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:33.380]
That's because it's zero baby.

[02:50:36.860 --> 02:50:39.820]
I can barely move my mouth.

[02:50:40.220 --> 02:50:41.120]
Oh, no.

[02:50:43.420 --> 02:50:46.080]
I'm a red hearted lover.

[02:50:48.620 --> 02:50:53.300]
But first I need to be thought out.

[02:50:55.340 --> 02:50:59.980]
Yes, I need to be thought out.

[02:51:01.420 --> 02:51:05.760]
That's because it's zero.

[02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:08.140]
That's it for you.

[02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:09.860]
Thanks to the state of California.

[02:51:09.860 --> 02:51:12.060]
Ibonics has become an official language.

[02:51:12.540 --> 02:51:13.900]
But on the east coast in Brooklyn,

[02:51:14.200 --> 02:51:15.940]
Pisanax is ruling the street.

[02:51:16.240 --> 02:51:17.860]
I use guys check out the

[02:51:17.860 --> 02:51:20.100]
**** and bambenos on that broad

[02:51:20.100 --> 02:51:21.880]
and get a load of her poop.

[02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:22.940]
English translation,

[02:51:23.340 --> 02:51:24.840]
I really enjoy her company.

[02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:26.240]
So last night,

[02:51:26.420 --> 02:51:28.320]
I banged the hell out of this chicken

[02:51:28.320 --> 02:51:29.760]
this real classy joint.

[02:51:29.900 --> 02:51:30.740]
English translation,

[02:51:31.040 --> 02:51:33.140]
I made love to her in the back of my chameleon.

[02:51:33.440 --> 02:51:34.340]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:51:34.720 --> 02:51:36.580]
I'm the main tenance director.

[02:51:36.800 --> 02:51:38.180]
We're all the youth hang out.

[02:51:38.180 --> 02:51:39.160]
English translation,

[02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:41.360]
I'm a janitor at the elementary school.

[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:43.140]
If you'd like to get your copy of

[02:51:43.140 --> 02:51:44.140]
Hooked on Pisanax,

[02:51:44.260 --> 02:51:46.440]
just stuff some money in a plain brown envelope

[02:51:46.440 --> 02:51:48.160]
and shove it under the back door of

[02:51:48.160 --> 02:51:49.700]
Mario's over on the west side

[02:51:49.700 --> 02:51:50.940]
and we'll be in touch.

[02:51:51.400 --> 02:51:52.420]
This Sunday,

[02:51:52.820 --> 02:51:53.960]
all the sopranos.

[02:51:54.560 --> 02:51:55.420]
So what, no ****?

[02:51:55.540 --> 02:51:56.020]
Do you know?

[02:51:56.280 --> 02:51:56.620]
Hey!

[02:51:57.240 --> 02:51:57.840]
Well, me.

[02:51:58.360 --> 02:51:59.300]
What's up, my ****?

[02:51:59.680 --> 02:52:00.460]
It's just his ass.

[02:52:00.920 --> 02:52:01.840]
It comes to Pro's Act.

[02:52:02.180 --> 02:52:02.900]
You would take the lips.

[02:52:03.980 --> 02:52:04.860]
Go with the tits.

[02:52:05.160 --> 02:52:06.360]
Tuttle **** though.

[02:52:06.360 --> 02:52:07.540]
You mother ****.

[02:52:08.060 --> 02:52:10.100]
He's got a real **** attitude problem.

[02:52:10.540 --> 02:52:11.680]
Why'd you kick me in a ****ing head?

[02:52:11.960 --> 02:52:13.760]
The words will come blowing out your ass.

[02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:14.880]
Put it in your shirt on.

[02:52:15.360 --> 02:52:16.080]
I'm getting it, Toby.

[02:52:16.360 --> 02:52:17.400]
There's two things I'm good at.

[02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:18.260]
It's all intense.

[02:52:18.900 --> 02:52:20.220]
It's spotting good **** jobs.

[02:52:20.540 --> 02:52:22.060]
I might not be able to wipe my own ass.

[02:52:22.320 --> 02:52:22.600]
You know that.

[02:52:22.940 --> 02:52:23.940]
You're born to this ****.

[02:52:24.120 --> 02:52:25.300]
I'm not babbling it at.

[02:52:25.500 --> 02:52:27.440]
Can you just shut the **** up about it?

[02:52:27.660 --> 02:52:28.400]
Stick it up your ass.

[02:52:28.820 --> 02:52:29.900]
Yeah, we touch a **** off.

[02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:32.000]
Can't you stop under the vaporizer?

[02:52:32.200 --> 02:52:33.600]
You're stupid mother ****, you know that?

[02:52:33.960 --> 02:52:35.640]
You **** piece of ****.

[02:52:35.640 --> 02:52:39.120]
Oh, now please don't start with the name.

[02:52:39.500 --> 02:52:41.020]
This **** is your problem.

[02:52:41.040 --> 02:52:42.820]
Or the ****ing audience with the Pope.

[02:52:43.220 --> 02:52:45.580]
I bet you're very good to your mother.

[02:52:45.920 --> 02:52:46.220]
****.

[02:52:46.440 --> 02:52:47.340]
You **** what?

[02:52:48.100 --> 02:52:48.880]
Yeah **** you.

[02:52:49.080 --> 02:52:51.240]
Are you **** going to make a **** day, huh?

[02:52:51.740 --> 02:52:53.980]
It's nothing but a bracket for the Jews.

[02:52:54.620 --> 02:52:55.180]
Jesus Christ.

[02:52:55.360 --> 02:52:55.740]
How you doing?

[02:52:56.220 --> 02:52:57.020]
No, Zing.

[02:52:57.460 --> 02:52:58.460]
Eat your money, God.

[02:52:58.800 --> 02:52:59.960]
I can't eat there.

[02:53:00.080 --> 02:53:01.020]
It's got cholesterol.

[02:53:01.620 --> 02:53:03.520]
Can I just get some macaroni and gravy?

[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:04.620]
It's **** you.

[02:53:04.620 --> 02:53:06.240]
You **** you.

[02:53:06.560 --> 02:53:07.140]
**** me.

[02:53:07.380 --> 02:53:09.780]
I don't like that kind of talk.

[02:53:09.960 --> 02:53:10.900]
Anybody else want a mouth off?

[02:53:11.260 --> 02:53:13.020]
This I'm going to bokeh.

[02:53:18.100 --> 02:53:19.640]
Welcome back to the highly rated,

[02:53:19.840 --> 02:53:21.260]
oh, how are the David's in the show?

[02:53:21.440 --> 02:53:21.920]
I'm your wife.

[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:23.540]
Putting to my own straggation.

[02:53:23.840 --> 02:53:24.500]
Okay, stupid.

[02:53:24.500 --> 02:53:25.080]
Where were we?

[02:53:25.220 --> 02:53:25.880]
We were doing this.

[02:53:27.040 --> 02:53:28.880]
No, you were doing that to me.

[02:53:29.040 --> 02:53:30.160]
Oh, yeah, sorry, Mo.

[02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:31.520]
That's better.

[02:53:32.660 --> 02:53:34.060]
Oh, Ron Day.

[02:53:34.760 --> 02:53:35.260]
Chris?

[02:53:36.020 --> 02:53:37.780]
Nick, I didn't see you could play that desk.

[02:53:37.900 --> 02:53:38.200]
Okay.

[02:53:38.560 --> 02:53:39.580]
Ron Day.

[02:53:40.500 --> 02:53:41.020]
Now you.

[02:53:41.340 --> 02:53:41.560]
Chris.

[02:53:42.500 --> 02:53:42.940]
Carl.

[02:53:43.780 --> 02:53:44.940]
Yeah, I wasn't.

[02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:47.820]
Ron Day gets me.

[02:53:48.600 --> 02:53:49.720]
That's that's it.

[02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:51.320]
That I might watch you pump.

[02:53:51.620 --> 02:53:51.800]
Dang.

[02:53:52.640 --> 02:53:53.640]
Ron Day.

[02:53:54.040 --> 02:53:54.120]
Yeah.

[02:53:55.380 --> 02:53:56.320]
He's up with you.

[02:53:56.680 --> 02:53:56.960]
Far.

[02:53:57.220 --> 02:53:58.380]
What's with that kung fu, Grick?

[02:53:58.660 --> 02:53:59.320]
Sorry, Mo.

[02:53:59.580 --> 02:54:01.840]
We got one of our three-thirty important callers

[02:54:01.840 --> 02:54:02.520]
on the line here.

[02:54:02.940 --> 02:54:03.840]
WQAM, what do you want?

[02:54:03.840 --> 02:54:04.840]
Can we hear that?

[02:54:04.980 --> 02:54:05.360]
Yeah, Mo.

[02:54:05.640 --> 02:54:06.720]
I just...

[02:54:06.720 --> 02:54:08.640]
Come on, come on, spin it out.

[02:54:08.820 --> 02:54:09.580]
What's your cake?

[02:54:10.300 --> 02:54:11.300]
Oh, Ron.

[02:54:12.020 --> 02:54:13.740]
You don't understand the goddamn thing you're saying?

[02:54:13.960 --> 02:54:14.400]
What are you doing?

[02:54:15.040 --> 02:54:17.180]
I'm playing with my very poker.

[02:54:17.620 --> 02:54:18.460]
I'm all head down.

[02:54:18.860 --> 02:54:20.380]
Oh, that's quite understandable.

[02:54:20.900 --> 02:54:22.440]
Why, are you sometimes...

[02:54:22.440 --> 02:54:22.920]
Don't be out.

[02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:24.040]
Don't be out.

[02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:25.080]
Yeah, you'll be.

[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:25.960]
He's a...

[02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:26.320]
Ah!

[02:54:26.980 --> 02:54:27.760]
Oh, yeah.

[02:54:28.420 --> 02:54:29.040]
Oh, yeah.

[02:54:29.380 --> 02:54:30.400]
God be told now.

[02:54:31.180 --> 02:54:31.960]
Almost there.

[02:54:32.280 --> 02:54:33.000]
Say, oh, Ron Day.

[02:54:33.460 --> 02:54:34.260]
Ron Day.

[02:54:34.540 --> 02:54:35.280]
Ron Day.

[02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:37.020]
Ron Day.

[02:54:37.700 --> 02:54:38.560]
Ron Day.

[02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:38.720]
Ron Day.

[02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:39.360]
Ron Day.

[02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:39.700]
Ron Day.

[02:54:39.840 --> 02:54:40.020]
Ron Day.

[02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:40.780]
Ron Day.

[02:54:41.140 --> 02:54:41.900]
Ron Day.

[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:43.020]
Ron Day.

[02:54:43.280 --> 02:54:45.300]
Ron Day.

[02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:45.840]
Oh.

[02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:49.460]
You don't...

[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:50.300]
Array.

[02:54:51.440 --> 02:54:51.440]

[02:54:52.180 --> 02:54:52.900]
Uh-oh.

[02:54:53.260 --> 02:54:53.620]
Look at that.

[02:54:53.980 --> 02:54:55.120]
I got it all over my winky.

[02:54:55.400 --> 02:54:55.680]
Yeah.

[02:54:55.980 --> 02:54:57.660]
20 watts, I'll do that fine until noon.

[02:54:57.840 --> 02:54:59.000]
Don't say that until one.

[02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:00.260]
Oh, brother, that'd be bad news.

[02:55:00.840 --> 02:55:03.920]
Mad dog will be along at one o'clock to hump with three, and we've got to pant her hockey

[02:55:03.920 --> 02:55:05.260]
game tonight, and all that stuff.

[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:08.080]
Hey, if you love your home, but you just don't have enough space to do all the things

[02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:09.600]
you need to be doing, here's the answer for you.

[02:55:09.960 --> 02:55:13.280]
Do hundreds of other people, to smart people like little Georgia, do, and call strictly

[02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:13.960]
additions.

[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:15.860]
Whether you're having a baby, need another room.

[02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:18.380]
Maybe you're converting a carport or patio and living space.

[02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:21.480]
Maybe you're going into business for yourself and want to make a home orifice.

[02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:22.540]
Well, here's the answer.

[02:55:22.980 --> 02:55:26.300]
Just pick up the phone and call strictly to...

[02:55:26.300 --> 02:55:28.460]
Seriously, next time I say that, I'm just getting up and walking out.

[02:55:28.620 --> 02:55:29.260]
So pick up all.

[02:55:29.820 --> 02:55:33.280]
There you're one stop shop, more space for your place, place with an absolutely worry for

[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:35.220]
your approach to expanding your living space.

[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:36.840]
There was no shows by the contractors.

[02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:38.340]
Uh-uh, ain't going to happen.

[02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:39.780]
In complete work, no chance.

[02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:43.340]
No one expected bills, no worries about the job not getting done right, and they take

[02:55:43.340 --> 02:55:45.540]
care of every single last detail.

[02:55:45.660 --> 02:55:48.580]
They drop your blueprints, they get the building permits, handle all your inspections

[02:55:48.580 --> 02:55:48.960]
too.

[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:53.460]
Strictly, this business has got that very easy, it's a simple, five step approach to total

[02:55:53.460 --> 02:55:54.360]
customer satisfaction.

[02:55:54.900 --> 02:55:56.320]
They want you to be satisfied.

[02:55:56.840 --> 02:55:59.760]
First of all, they call the schedule a free project evaluation employment at your home,

[02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:03.240]
where a project is made able to determine the exact scope of your addition.

[02:56:03.620 --> 02:56:06.460]
Secondly, schedule a bit appointment in their convenience room where you'll get a detailed

[02:56:06.460 --> 02:56:09.240]
proposal and an exact price to the penny for the work.

[02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:12.720]
Third, select your finishing touches, go to contract, fourth review, there's on our

[02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:16.260]
contextual drugs, and then fifth, last, and most definitely not least, you sit back

[02:56:16.260 --> 02:56:17.620]
with a smile on your push and relax.

[02:56:18.140 --> 02:56:22.400]
As your dream edition moves ahead on schedule with unbeatable quality, it's as easy as, uh,

[02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:23.340]
one, two, three.

[02:56:23.340 --> 02:56:26.460]
Give strictly a distance of call, you can see there are in the other pages if you like,

[02:56:26.580 --> 02:56:31.140]
they serve all are brown and south Palm Beach, call 954-791-8100.

[02:56:31.920 --> 02:56:35.940]
That's 954-791-8100, they're licensed, they're insured professionals who wanted to

[02:56:35.940 --> 02:56:37.620]
waste a dopendish job for you.

[02:56:37.700 --> 02:56:38.480]
Trust me when I tell you.

[02:56:38.740 --> 02:56:42.980]
Tell them that Old Neil told you to call strictly additions at 954-791-8100.

[02:57:12.980 --> 02:57:18.500]
One can know the only one, he'd have to put the death stock lands into the rebellion's

[02:57:18.500 --> 02:57:24.700]
hands so nook and OV-1 have to get to all the runs, so they stopped him too much

[02:57:24.700 --> 02:57:32.720]
I'd like to have a drink with hot after Star Wars Star Wars campaigner, the weirdest

[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:35.180]
creatures you've ever seen on.

[02:57:35.180 --> 02:57:46.620]
He's at the Star Wars Star Wars campaigner, music and master, then old Jedi masters at the Star Wars.

[02:57:47.140 --> 02:57:48.700]
What that fool has told you?

[02:57:48.940 --> 02:57:50.480]
He was sold on the console.

[02:57:50.660 --> 02:57:57.380]
He was a pilot with a laughter at his side, and a smile well far sex wide there with

[02:57:57.380 --> 02:57:58.280]
two fox guys.

[02:57:58.560 --> 02:58:00.500]
He was the worst kid.

[02:58:00.500 --> 02:58:06.940]
They met with Luke in OV-1 about the millennium, for him docking Bay 94.

[02:58:06.940 --> 02:58:11.620]
Don't troopers at the door with a flash of ben's lights in.

[02:58:11.980 --> 02:58:19.700]
Come here and hug the wall with the Star Wars Star Wars campaigner, the weirdest creatures

[02:58:19.700 --> 02:58:21.720]
you've ever seen on.

[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:33.460]
He had the Star Wars Star Wars Cantina Music and Wasters and old Jedi Masters at the Star Wars

[02:58:33.460 --> 02:58:41.060]
Most I should speak for him, he will never find the more retro-time Scumland-pillowy

[02:58:41.800 --> 02:58:43.140]
He was decautions

[02:58:43.140 --> 02:58:46.980]
His name was Yoda, he was a Muppet

[02:58:47.760 --> 02:58:53.300]
Darth Vader was so bad and by the way he's loose that he kissed his sister

[02:58:53.300 --> 02:58:58.560]
His hand got gone off in that gauzy far far away

[02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:02.440]
Luke his hat allows you day over that was so meek

[02:59:02.440 --> 02:59:04.200]
Jobber had bad hygiene

[02:59:04.200 --> 02:59:12.280]
Why didn't they all just relax back on tap to eat at the Star Wars Star Wars Cantina

[02:59:12.280 --> 02:59:28.480]
The wind reaches you've ever seen on the Star Wars Star Wars Cantina Music and Wasters and old Jedi Masters at the Star Wars

[02:59:28.480 --> 02:59:30.940]
The thoughts will be with you

[02:59:32.240 --> 02:59:41.180]
All the things that we've seen on the Star Wars

[02:59:45.440 --> 02:59:46.960]
Cantina music plays

[02:59:46.960 --> 02:59:49.380]
Think he'd die for head on the f***ers

[02:59:50.180 --> 02:59:53.120]
Think he'd die for head on the f***ers

[02:59:53.120 --> 02:59:56.500]
Think he'd die for head on the f***ers

[02:59:57.180 --> 02:59:59.960]
Think he'd die for head on the f***ers

[02:59:59.960 --> 03:00:03.660]
Let up with these goddamn hammer-juckies

[03:00:04.180 --> 03:00:07.260]
As this pussy has political correctness

[03:00:07.260 --> 03:00:09.440]
Rats in full you ninja

[03:00:09.440 --> 03:00:11.640]
Around the big pretons

[03:00:11.640 --> 03:00:14.280]
It shoveled up this fairly tight

[03:00:14.280 --> 03:00:15.780]
Speak the movie

[03:00:15.780 --> 03:00:17.260]
Think he'd die for head on the f***ers

[03:00:18.660 --> 03:00:21.440]
Think he'd die for head on the f***ers

[03:00:22.280 --> 03:00:28.560]
Think he'd die for head on the f***ers

[03:00:29.300 --> 03:00:32.120]
Think he'd die for head on the f***ers

[03:00:32.920 --> 03:00:35.780]
Think he'd die for head on the f***ers

[03:00:36.660 --> 03:00:39.680]
Stinky type of head for the f***ers!

[03:00:40.220 --> 03:00:42.920]
Stinky type of head for the f***ers!

[03:00:43.440 --> 03:00:44.960]
That's a grapple hair!

[03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:53.220]
We put a retarded girl in our all-new Machitsu B-sheet to show you how well it drives.

[03:01:01.900 --> 03:01:05.120]
Our agency thought this would move some product out of the showroom.

[03:01:09.160 --> 03:01:10.360]
Look at her gal!

[03:01:12.200 --> 03:01:14.600]
This is funnier than watching retires at the park.

[03:01:23.780 --> 03:01:27.360]
If someone had some fairly retarded, you can out that much fun in an interview.

[03:01:29.500 --> 03:01:31.100]
She's having enough of a big change!

[03:01:38.260 --> 03:01:39.340]
I'm not going to let you go!

[03:01:39.580 --> 03:01:39.980]
I'm not going to let you go!

[03:01:39.980 --> 03:01:49.760]
Back in the day when someone was wrong, we didn't take their crap.

[03:01:50.180 --> 03:01:56.300]
In Pearl Harbor, when the jabs dropped their bombs, we bombed them bad.

[03:01:56.300 --> 03:02:00.140]
And now the Saudis, they hit us hard.

[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:03.100]
And on our cards, our little flags wave.

[03:02:04.100 --> 03:02:10.040]
As that Saudi-loving retard points the bombers the wrong way.

[03:02:13.420 --> 03:02:20.620]
And of enbarras to be in America, where they found no boos like cheese.

[03:02:20.620 --> 03:02:28.140]
The United States of arrogance, thereby push any family, breathing under country.

[03:02:29.260 --> 03:02:33.340]
Up, and the late daughter of the darkest days in my history.

[03:02:34.780 --> 03:02:42.140]
I don't want to be a packs of Americans in the goddamn USA.

[03:02:46.960 --> 03:02:53.600]
What's a few thousand innocent lives stop living in the nest?

[03:02:54.220 --> 03:03:00.800]
If you want that SUV to drive, you're going to need more gas.

[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:04.980]
It's the greatest country in the world!

[03:03:04.980 --> 03:03:07.120]
They train us to believe.

[03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:14.600]
And anyone who says that, obviously, ends up for to be.

[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:24.300]
And of enbarras to be in America, where we take trionically.

[03:03:25.300 --> 03:03:31.300]
Wave a flag in one hand with our head in the sand, and blindly follow the powers that be.

[03:03:31.300 --> 03:03:38.340]
Habitatik, fuck up, washing state for news on a 65 inch screen.

[03:03:39.300 --> 03:03:42.560]
Scratch your balls and find everything's okay.

[03:03:44.400 --> 03:03:49.020]
In the goddamn USA, out in America.

[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:55.680]
Stop the county far redone.

[03:03:56.420 --> 03:03:59.640]
This part is hard to stop.

[03:04:00.760 --> 03:04:03.480]
The county far redone.

[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:09.380]
Make sure that your keep on coming home over.

[03:04:10.840 --> 03:04:13.400]
This face is home over.

[03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:23.760]
Judge your farmer is aware that George's farm wants to soon try and food and talk.

[03:04:24.400 --> 03:04:27.760]
The idea he's a dumbass in he wild.

[03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:31.860]
Larian's farm is his ample time.

[03:04:32.720 --> 03:04:36.200]
Don't bother them about him all this year now.

[03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:39.600]
They want George to be proud.

[03:04:39.600 --> 03:04:42.440]
Don't bother them about him all this year.

[03:04:44.020 --> 03:04:48.360]
Don't bother them about him all this year.

[03:04:48.820 --> 03:04:49.380]
Don't bother them about him all this year.

[03:04:49.380 --> 03:04:52.280]
Stop the county far redone.

[03:04:53.040 --> 03:05:06.860]
Make sure that George's farm is coming home over.

[03:05:15.700 --> 03:05:17.440]
I'm ready to leave the country 180.

[03:05:17.940 --> 03:05:19.060]
I'm ecstatic 116.

[03:05:20.060 --> 03:05:21.800]
I'm a suicidal 82.

[03:05:22.280 --> 03:05:24.020]
I don't give a shmit 52.

[03:05:24.020 --> 03:05:28.120]
I'm a suicidal 82.

[03:05:31.020 --> 03:05:41.180]
I'm a suicidal 82.

[03:05:41.180 --> 03:05:42.020]
I'm a suicidal 82.

[03:05:46.720 --> 03:05:48.360]
I'm a suicidal 82.

[03:05:48.800 --> 03:05:51.500]
I'm a suicidal 82.

[03:05:54.420 --> 03:05:58.560]
I was going to clean my room until I got hot.

[03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.860]
I was going to get up and find the broom.

[03:06:03.260 --> 03:06:04.560]
But then I got hot.

[03:06:06.480 --> 03:06:08.660]
My room is still messed up.

[03:06:08.660 --> 03:06:10.080]
And I know why.

[03:06:11.540 --> 03:06:12.940]
Because I got hot.

[03:06:17.680 --> 03:06:21.640]
I was going to go to class before I got hot.

[03:06:22.040 --> 03:06:26.180]
I could have cheated and I could have passed.

[03:06:29.420 --> 03:06:31.960]
I'm taking a next semester.

[03:06:32.220 --> 03:06:33.220]
And I know why.

[03:06:34.680 --> 03:06:36.100]
Because I got hot.

[03:06:36.520 --> 03:06:38.800]
Because I got hot.

[03:06:41.180 --> 03:06:43.240]
I was going to go to court.

[03:06:43.640 --> 03:06:48.960]
I was going to pay my child support.

[03:06:49.520 --> 03:06:50.540]
But then I got hot.

[03:06:50.700 --> 03:06:53.800]
I know why.

[03:06:57.380 --> 03:07:00.560]
Because I got hot.

[03:07:04.040 --> 03:07:06.500]
I wasn't going to run from the cops.

[03:07:06.780 --> 03:07:07.800]
But I was hot.

[03:07:08.140 --> 03:07:09.340]
I was serious man.

[03:07:09.980 --> 03:07:12.120]
I was going to pull right over and stop.

[03:07:12.800 --> 03:07:13.660]
But I was hot.

[03:07:16.420 --> 03:07:18.440]
I'm a tear up pleat shaking.

[03:07:18.720 --> 03:07:19.460]
I know why.

[03:07:20.960 --> 03:07:22.300]
Because I got hot.

[03:07:22.900 --> 03:07:23.700]
Because I got hot.

[03:07:27.100 --> 03:07:29.620]
I was going to make love to you.

[03:07:30.240 --> 03:07:35.400]
I was going to eat your pussy too.

[03:07:38.860 --> 03:07:41.060]
Now I'm chickeno.

[03:07:41.180 --> 03:07:42.680]
And I know why.

[03:07:44.060 --> 03:07:45.280]
Because I got hot.

[03:07:45.440 --> 03:07:46.140]
I know why.

[03:07:47.920 --> 03:07:49.680]
I know why.

[03:07:50.680 --> 03:07:51.820]
I miss so much.

[03:07:52.200 --> 03:07:54.340]
Because I got hot.

[03:07:55.840 --> 03:07:57.880]
I lost my keys.

[03:07:58.300 --> 03:08:00.060]
Because I got hot.

[03:08:01.580 --> 03:08:04.300]
Now I'm sleeping on the sidewalk.

[03:08:04.760 --> 03:08:05.740]
And I know why.

[03:08:07.860 --> 03:08:11.420]
Because I got hot.

[03:08:13.600 --> 03:08:15.700]
I'm not singing this song.

[03:08:15.700 --> 03:08:17.140]
Because I'm hot.

[03:08:19.140 --> 03:08:21.540]
I'm singing this whole thing wrong.

[03:08:21.780 --> 03:08:23.100]
Because I'm hot.

[03:08:24.580 --> 03:08:27.440]
And if I don't sell one copy.

[03:08:27.980 --> 03:08:29.380]
I'm a wild one.

[03:08:29.760 --> 03:08:31.620]
Because I'm hot.

[03:08:32.080 --> 03:08:34.460]
Because I'm hot.

[03:08:35.040 --> 03:08:36.220]
Are you light on me?

[03:08:38.660 --> 03:08:40.220]
Because I'm hot.

[03:08:40.220 --> 03:08:41.140]
He really is hot.

[03:08:43.500 --> 03:08:45.400]
What a sensational way to close it up.

[03:08:45.400 --> 03:08:48.720]
He'll be next tanker three hockey tonight.

[03:08:50.700 --> 03:08:54.220]
I'm climbing 16th on the QAN Miami for learning.

[03:08:54.500 --> 03:08:55.480]
Kill some people.
