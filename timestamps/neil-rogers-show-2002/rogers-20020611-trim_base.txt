[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]
Roger show on 560 WQAM

[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.920]
Hello

[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.720]
Hello

[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.540]
I think it's so grooming out that people are fine again together thinking about it so much

[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.580]
Okay, let me ask you this question. Why are you playing music?

[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.240]
Are you not hearing because you weren't on? No, we weren't hearing you in the beginning

[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.960]
How's that possible? I don't want to say why?

[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.360]
I miss why not?

[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.460]
Inquiring minds want to know

[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.000]
Let's go I miss it. Should I just start over again?

[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.880]
Yes, why do we have to go through this? We sit and talk for an hour and a half before the show starts every goddamn morning

[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.020]
And then all of a sudden like a two minutes before the top of the hour somebody screw things up in there

[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.540]
I don't want to mention what might be today, but who is it?

[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.280]
It's me Robert. Not the beast is it?

[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.680]
Nope

[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.060]
It's Robert

[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.900]
Oh Robert, well that's because you didn't like our pull on Bush

[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.600]
You're last name

[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.000]
I filled my tank up

[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.880]
How was I to know I'd be helping finance 9-11 by giving money to Unicaul or Avacol and the Carlyle roof?

[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.700]
I've turned my lights on last night

[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.520]
How was I to know I was paying James Baker's green fees?

[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.900]
I made two to two today

[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.240]
How was I to know I was providing bathwater to the Middle East?

[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.300]
Well, that made some bad again

[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:43.300]
Every time you light a marijuana cigarette, you're helping to finance where I'm going over lords and breaking a law based on the old movie Refer Madness

[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.320]
Better Jiu Jiu on up is the schedule of a poor man guide

[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.640]
I just spent a revert joint

[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.400]
Now I'm white man you know

[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.820]
For now I'm the jump of this window

[00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.300]
AHHHHH

[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.100]
This message paid for by the committee to keep America in the dark ages

[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.680]
That boy they're doing a good job, I'll tell that

[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.760]
So let me ask you, do you hear me now everything okay?

[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.400]
Yeah, we hear you find sounds wonderful

[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.060]
Okay good, that's good

[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.700]
This is getting pretty embarrassing you know

[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.300]
And it's always on that end, is it everyone this end?

[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.520]
No

[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.580]
Always on that end down there, which is one of the many many reasons

[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.460]
Far too lengthy to a document here in this short period of time like four hours

[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.880]
Why I'm glad that I'm not there

[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.040]
The home of incompetence and ineptitude

[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.380]
Just like yesterday we got a blockhead

[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.200]
See this is the problem when you put a bunch of ex-jocks on the ear who pretend to be broadcasters

[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.720]
I don't want to pick on blockhead Joe Rose but the fact is that this guy he how long has he been and was he a QA

[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.780]
And before they finally you know before he finally departed one way or the other I don't nine years something like that

[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.920]
Last time I heard huh I don't know I think it was at least yeah years

[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.020]
And this guy doesn't know a program log from from Mr. Whipple

[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.500]
He doesn't know what the hell program log looks like

[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.100]
And this is the deal you got a bunch of ex-jocks who don't know how to turn on a microphone who wouldn't know what the hell a goddamn log looks like if you stuck one up their ass

[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.020]
And that's why we had all that the hello it was very exciting radio yesterday

[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.100]
I thought it was fun

[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.380]
It was so great we had a pretty good time the good news is the black sack showed up today

[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.820]
That's good news

[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.920]
So everybody's got their free food

[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.680]
That's the most important part as long as they keep getting the free food they're happy especially George

[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.940]
Yep

[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.800]
996 votes 966 votes on a podium today

[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.100]
How do you rate the job that President Bush and his administration are doing?

[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.780]
He's a Bozo and disaster 422 that's 43.6%

[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.500]
Okay, he's doing okay 184 19% excellent 159

[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.340]
I think Robert voted 50 times on that 16.4% which is very scary to me by the way

[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:57.780]
Fair 134 13.8% and poor 67 6.9% when you consider its our ultra liberal audience

[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.960]
He didn't do that bad because you got to understand that during times like these

[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.960]
It's just not fashionable or criticize the president and his colleagues his cohorts his partners in crime

[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.500]
Just like this dog and pony show they put on yesterday we'll get to that's come back that

[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.820]
Puerto Rican guys what George says

[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.040]
Who?

[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.500]
Jose Padilla we'll get to him momentarily

[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.580]
We got bigger fish to five first

[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.580]
Well, I mean they arrested him on the 8th of May you don't think it was just like coincidence after all this heat coming down on the FBI and the CIA

[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.900]
And all these embarrassments that escrops just decided to make this announcement from Russian oil as yesterday

[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.580]
They arrested him on the 8th of May

[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.980]
And then last night on the CBS even news they're saying well maybe it was the suitcase bomb

[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.380]
Maybe it wasn't the duty bomb well you know

[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.800]
But there it's a dog and pony show and of course the majority of the people being the lemmings that they are out there

[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.700]
Just waiting to be lit by the nose oh look at this we got it we got a bad one we got an evil door let's hear it

[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.760]
And of course there's always that South Florida connection notice every every scumbag that comes down to pike

[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.260]
Even if they arrested like in Japan somewhere no matter where they find a scumbag there's always a South Florida connection

[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.580]
Speaking of scumbags let's talk about Pete Boulder momentarily if we can

[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.220]
They're last name

[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.440]
Got kid at the IOD INZ clear channel continues doing it the brilliant Barry Jackass writes in a hero this morning

[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.240]
Phil Latsman fired for criticizing shows I'm gonna tell you something Pete Boulder

[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.980]
I would call you scum but that would be an insult to all the scum on the face of the earth

[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.540]
Whatever whatever is about 20 steps lower than scum that's what you and your cohorts a cheap channel RPD Boulder

[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.320]
You little tiny scumbag you

[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.640]
Clear channel and the reason I'm using that term is because there's nothing else I can use on the year how about Schmidthead

[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.900]
Okay in fact when somebody's got a wild bout of messy diarrhea that's Pete Boulder where you find in the bowl

[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.820]
That's exactly what you find here on a double rated Schmidt that's him

[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.460]
Clear channel committed not that I'm such a big Phil Latsman fan even always listening right now and he's a big group of the show

[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.560]
Is he's okay never stole a freight train he's alright kind of weak now actually is a pretty good guy

[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.220]
Clear channel communications on Monday fire W I O D W I N Z sportscaster Phil Latsman

[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.000]
Who blasted his former or our employer is a classless place not committed to doing good radio

[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.360]
Well, that's the understatement of the century

[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:32.800]
Latsman said program director Pete the assassin Boulder said he was dropped because he criticized other programming on a station

[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.240]
Well, he sure got some nerve don't he that you're not criticizing other programming on that station

[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:45.540]
Latsman 33 said several months ago he referred to W I N Z's pre-nascar program the racing nuts as the illiteracy hour

[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.960]
And advised listeners to go down to the nearest trailer park for translation. I think that's a panic. I think that's great

[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:57.640]
In fact any with a blah blah I'm not going to apologize to Joe Castella because he just got bad taste the fact of the matter is that's true

[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:06.540]
Nascar's for rednecks that whole thing trailer trash and then some Jason Salahkin will take over for Latsman on W I N Z

[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.720]
I don't know I'm most fed all this time on this because nobody listens that station anyway they got fractions

[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.340]
Jason Salahkin will take over for Latsman on W I N Z 6 to 7 p.m. weeknight sports talk show and could get the job permanently

[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:26.240]
Latsman also been W I O D's heat pre-game show door. Yeah, it says Latsman also been W I O D's heat pre-game show

[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.500]
Nice go there Barry you illiterate little puddle hacker you turd

[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:36.560]
Clear channel doesn't care about quality programming Latsman said they were looking for an excuse to your rid of me because I made too much money

[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.160]
After 10 years there I got only two weeks severance pay

[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.700]
Latsman married with two kids and he'll seek another job in the market since very jackass

[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:51.200]
So you know the beat goes on Latsman gets canned gets dumped unceremoniously at I O D I N Z because he was making more than five bucks an hour

[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:58.940]
You know yesterday right toward the end of the show I was the very last story that I did was a story about Peter Gotti

[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:04.060]
And it mentioned it like John Gotti and I'm watching TV a little bit later on yesterday afternoon and guess who died?

[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.400]
John Gotti

[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.160]
John Gotti the godfather

[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.040]
He died?

[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.620]
He died the godfather

[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.880]
So now let me forget right before the end of the show today for me to talk about Pete Bulger

[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.280]
What are you laughing about? You don't mess with this kid okay? How many times have I done that?

[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:28.460]
Talked about somebody and all of a sudden but I'm bing but I'm bing don't see them no more just like Paulie and a godfather

[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.520]
Mother scratching idiot Pete Bulger how many lives you couldn't count on your fingers and toes

[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.420]
All the lives that that son of a bitch has ruined in that market just just pathetic

[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.760]
And of course he continues to be there because he's delighted to be the assassin I think he takes joy in it now

[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.720]
You know what his favorite song is don't you?

[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.620]
Pete Bulger I get it

[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.600]
Yeah that's his theme song Liar Liar Pants on Fire

[00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:01.480]
Well I'm not going to get sidetracked with it go back to those packs and days all the stories the bull crap

[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.780]
Speaking of very important people in broadcasting this is probably the most important little more important than Phil Lansman

[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.440]
In the heraldous morning so it must be uh unapauso por favor

[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.040]
Did I say that right?

[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.940]
Were you speaking Portuguese?

[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.000]
Apauso

[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.900]
Did not I guess answer?

[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.340]
Sure whatever

[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.820]
You don't say as Ray Leridina

[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.260]
I love it on him

[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.980]
Shut up as Ray Leridina of the Relentlessly Xanifaradishos Sabato Gigante host Mario Kreizberger

[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.000]
Did you know that was his real name?

[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.360]
I knew he was Jewish

[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.800]
Better known by his legendary stage name Don Francisco as voiced as son of a man to his audience for four decades applause please

[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.200]
Unapauso por favor

[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:50.260]
On Monday it was a subdued and humble Don Francisco who said at Bongo's Cuban Cafe to celebrate the launching of a special issue people in Esponial celebrating his 40th year on the year

[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:50.820]
Let's hear it

[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.240]
40 years on the air for that you boy for that to speak whatever he is

[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.840]
Juben

[00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:01.100]
In this business you don't quit said Kreizberger whose telogenic hers are in the show a spot

[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:06.900]
In the Guinness Book of World Records is the longest continuously winning program in television history I bet you didn't know that

[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.780]
I had no idea and I think he's Chilean

[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.800]
And you know what that's not right either because hockey night in Canada has been on longer than 40 years

[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.320]
But hey what is Guinness know how they don't know from their hockey they're like mole they don't know their hockey

[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:24.520]
In this business you get retired by people or by ratings he says luckily Kreizberger's had plenty of admirers about a hundred

[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.140]
Many of them worldwide tune into the weekly

[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:31.480]
Sabato Gigante or giant Saturday on Univision because they want to see a bunch of hot naked people basically

[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.900]
This is the first time people in Esponial and off show to the English language magazine issued a special edition

[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:44.120]
The staff found ample inspiration they famously ebudient Don Francisco who allowed the magazine access to his archives his family even his wardrobe

[00:10:45.840 --> 00:11:00.740]
And it goes on a great length much too long for me anyway wTVJ NBC anchor NBC's six anchor Jackie Nesbrall and little Estefan co-host of Univision Entertainment show El Gordo E La Flaca got their started Don Francisco side

[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:07.120]
And what a sad commentary that is I'm sure he's a wonderful guy but if he's responsible for Jackie Nesbrall well nobody's perfect

[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:13.420]
He's like my father my TV father said racial D as a model on the show the son of German Jewish immigrants

[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:20.740]
Oi! Kreizberger began a program in 1962 in his native chili bringing it to Miami 1986 it was initially a hard sell

[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.580]
We couldn't get advertisers said Kreizberger received a star in the Hollywood Walker family last year

[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:30.060]
We went to one big department store in this man says Spanish television your viewers are our shop lifters but we proved him wrong

[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.140]
That's a great line

[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:39.140]
So anyway Guinness book of records is wrong because he's been on here for 40 years hockey night in Canada has been on here for I think of 50 years

[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:44.120]
In fact it is 50 years because they're celebrating 50 years last time how about those red wings last night I was pretty boring

[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.740]
Oh man get that over with already

[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:53.400]
It's already the 11th of freaking June get the hockey over with already got let Carolina go home with a you know their banjo between their legs and nice job

[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.760]
Good you know boring but get it over with

[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:02.520]

I

[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:12.000]
18 at 560 WQM kind of a rough start here this morning when you say but we'll make it we'll make it to the one o'clock

[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:17.980]
Now our poll Eric was getting a little bit pushing this morning much a question much a question much a question

[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.420]
Yes, he George and I worked feverishly to put this all together

[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.020]
This is the first in an installment in many I

[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.760]
Didn't I talk about that yesterday? I believe you did

[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.880]
Because there are so many one hit wonders that you can't do it all in one day and then Eric not only has got

[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.080]
What's the question but then he also had like some other suggestions on it?

[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.200]
We'll get to those okay Mr. Hot shot Mr. Music expert we'll get to them

[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:45.560]
But just the crew your jets ok the question is and it's already up there because George factored to him a long time ago

[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.840]
Hours ago probably about through this month I thought some of the list

[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.880]
But I didn't know the question how we're wording it while the question is I'm gonna give it to him right now for Christ

[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.520]
I said much question the question is which of these one hit wonders was the best

[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.460]
Pretty simple and uncomplicated about that is there I'm not sure I understand that question

[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.920]
Yeah, pretty complicated pretty complex

[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:09.280]
Which of these one hit wonders was the best and I had some on the list that I I don't know where the hell

[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.640]
I got him off some of these other list but I looked at my billboard book

[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.200]
I couldn't find a one hit wonder billboard book. I'm very sorry at the world's largest bookstore

[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.120]
In Wood Street couldn't find it sorry

[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:24.460]
But I did look in my book to verify we had some on it that were not one hit wonders like the five man electrical band for example signs great song

[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.440]
But they had a couple of other always that other one I

[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.940]
Forgot I did too, but I'm not gonna bend down and get to buy I don't want to bend down to them

[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.320]
Please don't get a little bit back home dangerous and

[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.480]
Then there's the list you go to our website. I'm at a little later

[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.560]
I'll read the whole thing for just in case you're not you're your computer right now. You want to get motivated

[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.440]
And yes, there are many more in this like I said it's the first in a series

[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.280]
I don't know when we'll do the next moment. Maybe we'll do it again tomorrow. I don't know

[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.080]
Maybe you'll do it a week from a circus whenever how I feel like it out here like that, huh? That's when we'll do it Eric

[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.320]
When the mood strikes me like tomorrow

[00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.620]
See and this really shocks me is because I didn't put this on it. Did I put it on there? Oh, I did put it on there

[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.160]
It's a second

[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.660]
Well, the reason I put it on there is because I could only find two

[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:13.900]
Two CDs yeah, well, I didn't have a lot of time to scour you know on today. I'll scour all the record stores downtown

[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.840]
But I only found two one hit wonder CDs

[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.940]
So I had to put some of the stuff on here for example. I wouldn't

[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:25.600]
Personally, I wouldn't vote for this myself, but since we had now we had that comedy bit on it right right?

[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.740]
Right and I love those by the way

[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.060]
And who don't like Taco?

[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.960]
To go to why don't you know where fashion sits?

[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.640]
Did he say sets? Yeah, he said schmitz

[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.300]
But anyway

[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.960]
See John Sebastian had a lot of hits with love and school pool, but

[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.960]
This was a memory of his one hit by himself

[00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:01.600]
You didn't even know that you didn't know that was John Sebastian did you? No, oh, I forgot I knew it before and then I bet you most of our music

[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:07.140]
Experts in the audience didn't know that was Johnson better great Johnson Sebastian either because it was such a crappy TV show good theme

[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:11.520]
But the you see the theme always annoyed me because I associated it with that show it was a good theme

[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.960]
One it I didn't like it

[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.700]
You didn't like that sorry, no, oh, yeah, it was kind of dippy

[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.340]
But now that I know that's Johnson Sebastian. I view it with a whole I listened to it with a whole different altitude

[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.080]
See even even at Dippy start. I like it

[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.280]
Anyway, we'll get to the list and all that stuff just calm down here

[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.520]
We could go ahead put it up there

[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.800]
We gave it a list hours ahead of time today and you make it at very complex

[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:38.520]
Which of these one hit wonders was the best and this is just the first installment there probably like about

[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.140]
5,000 one hit wonders wouldn't you think?

[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.520]
At least since we didn't put any like time limitation on this in fact the one sheet that somebody faxed me was just

[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:54.240]
1970 alone of which we took many of them in the stuck them on here today just one year of like the last 52 years for example since 50

[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.060]
Anyway CBS news we better get to your good close personal friend. What's his name?

[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.380]
What's his name Jose Padilla? Oh, yeah, my buddy one of your people

[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:11.620]
Not necessarily not in your close immediate family, but he's like just like what's his name over there Don Francisco's one of my people

[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.280]
I'll take down Francisco over Jose Padilla any day, but anyway

[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:20.600]
US officials are backing away from assertions that the man arrested last month in Chicago last month

[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.440]
Was plotting a dirty bomb attack on the US according to a CBS correspondent Jim Stewart

[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.460]
You know that trippy little Jim Stewart on CBS. Nope

[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.100]
Basically says they lied

[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.360]
US officials now admit they're not sure what American forna dola al-Muhau

[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.980]
Muhau years plans were ready returned to the West last month and any plot including possibly exploding radiation

[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.120]
Bomin Washington DC was in the initial planning stages

[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:49.160]
But given what he trained for an Afghanistan they'd expected the worst in other words. They didn't know what that was going on

[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:56.300]
He researched nuclear weapons and received training in wiring explosive violent Pakistan and was instructed to return to the West to conduct

[00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.860]
Recona-Sons operations for al-Qaeda's a deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz

[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.060]
Investigators had known a muhajir for some time including his alias

[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:10.960]
Much of their information about him came from Abu Zubeid al-Qaeda's top surviving operations officer until his capture last March

[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.300]
Who tipped them off to muhajir's American mission?

[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.080]
He had indicated some knowledge of Washington DC

[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.020]
But I want to emphasize again that there was not an actual plan

[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.580]
We stopped this man in the initial planning stages said wolf woods

[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:28.560]
That was echoed by FBI director Robert Mueller who also said the plan to explode a dirty bomb had not gotten past the planning stages

[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.500]
But don't let that stop the media

[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.760]
Because right away as soon as this story broke as soon as the announcement made the rest even it was over a month before

[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:42.420]
The media starts going on about dirty bombs and blah blah blah blah and radiation and run for the hills and hide under the table

[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:51.640]
Muhajir born in New York as Jose Padilla was detained by the FBI in Chicago over a month ago when he flew in from Pakistan on May the 8th

[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:55.820]
Yesterday the last time I checked was June the 10th more than a month later

[00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:02.180]
US Attorney General John Ascroft speaking in Moscow where he was meeting with the Russian officials announced he rest yesterday

[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:09.040]
We've disrupted an unfolding terrorist plot to attack the US by exploding a radioactive dirty bomb ascroft said

[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.760]
The Attorney General said the government had multiple independent and corroborating sources that LL

[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:20.380]
Muhajir was closely associated with al-Qaeda and was involved in planning future terrorist attacks on innocent American civilians in the US

[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:27.060]
I'm not poop-pulling the fact that they got him now just cut his legs off and put him in a broom closet somewhere and you know, so we'll be safe

[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:32.880]
But it's a part of the whole dog and pony show that just never ends because they got to cover the rest now

[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.680]
They got to make it look like they have some idea what's going on, which of course they don't

[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.400]
Then there's the Broward connection which we'll get to from the Sun sentinel. Did you read that? Of course not

[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.700]
Somebody read it to you? You will I will

[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:51.200]
But before that CNN dot com says it's the chaos not the chemicals that likely would cause the most harm should a dirty bomb explode

[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.860]
Experts say heart attacks not radiation poisoning might claim more victims

[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.820]
So what we're trying to say is in spite of the arrest everybody don't don't panic

[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:04.120]
That's what we're trying to say don't get all bet out of shape in spite of the media trying to get you all whipped up into a

[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:09.840]
hysterical frenzy don't do it don't do it don't get all been out of shape. There is no goddamn dirty bomb

[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.040]
People with a half mile radius of even a particularly potent dirty bomb would be exposed to less than the average dose of

[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.140]
Radiation of person received naturally within a year according to the American Institute of Physics website

[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.620]
Or there's nothing like a good physics. That's what my mother says

[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:30.280]
Most people are working radiation environments annually received ten times the exposure of a person with a half mile of a dirty bomb the site says

[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:36.080]
Stress and fear induced heart attacks are more likely to cause death after a dirty bomb explosion than a radioactive material

[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.840]
But let me stress again as far as we know there is no dirty bomb

[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.660]
There's a dirty rat, but there is no dirty bomb

[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.040]
We should emphasize that unlike the rest of the media. They're exploiting this like crazy

[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:54.760]
It said it's the ignorance of the actual threat that produces the most harm people may mistakenly envision a small-scale version of the nuclear devastation experience that Hiroshima

[00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:00.520]
Japan but the radioactive material and dirty bombs would not likely cause any more harm than that of the explosion itself

[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.440]
According to the council on foreign relations the size of the explosive device would dictate the extent of any death toll follow that

[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:13.120]
I got it in other words not something really nice, but not anything you could all hysterical about but the media wants people to get hysterical

[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:18.140]
Because then no watch and it's good for ratings and that's good for business and that's what the whole world is about about business

[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:26.960]
927 at 560 WQM speaking of business here's a simple question for you if somebody offered to give you just hand over to you several thousand dollars over the next few years

[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:33.520]
Would you take it or be a little stupid not to do it which makes it really foolish to pass up a chance to refinance or buy a home at just

[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.900]
3.95 percent

[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:41.540]
Here's the deal is a Fannie Mae program available 3.95 percent for both refinancing and purchasing of homes think about it

[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:49.440]
Just 3.95 percent and all you have to do is call financial group at their toll free number 1 800 940 53 63

[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:56.560]
To be more specific you can get yourself a hundred grand with payments of only 475 bucks a month or get you 200 grand with payments of only

[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.420]
950 dollars a month you'll save yourself a crap load of money so it'd be downright stupid to pass up a chance like that

[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:08.600]
Do the math and do the next smart thing get the details by calling financial group toll free it's 1 800 940 lend

[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:15.840]
That's 1 800 940 53 63 there were an equal housing lender credit restrictions do apply and rates are sub

[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.120]
Like they're my natural team

[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.060]
We take the 10 on 440 560

[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.060]
QAF

[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.020]
Diddy Tuckett or Diddy Cockett

[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.120]
And bad to even touch myself

[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.820]

I know one who piles it high

[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:25.600]
No one stops until I'm unconscious

[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.080]
Let's have a piece of that pie

[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.680]
I close my eyes and I'm dreaming of four crimes

[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.420]
I'm getting some fear and some thinking too

[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:43.120]
I'm rolling around in a big plate of lasagna

[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.420]

Oh I don't want to keep a fool coming

[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.020]
I know one who piles it high

[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:54.300]
No one stops until I'm unconscious

[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.440]
Let's have a piece of that pie

[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.000]

[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.860]
Which one of these you like best out of this particular list?

[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.920]

Well he was Jewish once upon a time

[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.780]
Did he become like some kind of a born again nut?

[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.980]
I don't know anything about him

[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.640]

[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:41.940]
Are you aware of that conversation yes that's what fat boy was telling me in a hallway and of course when he says it let's hope we can keep him alive long enough to make sure it gets done next year

My landlord got a sense of humor my mattress over there is like a brick on a on a wooden platform that's my mattress in Amsterdam

[00:34:54.040 --> 00:35:00.760]
I mean it's a little better than that but that's what it feels like if your mattress isn't worth a crap then your back isn't any good and you feel like crap all the time

[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:05.940]
If you want to feel great get a great night sleep every night call the experts at Dalmatians one easy phone call man

[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:13.300]

And no store anywhere in the world can match their selection or they're exceptionally low every day prices no bait and swish

[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:37.000]

[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.320]

[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:57.980]
No now it's got 14 so I think it's a little suspect Norman Greenbaum is spirit in the skies got six mountain Mississippi Queen got five also five paper lays that I check

[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:07.620]
Oh die oh jeez the stench of commoner and look at that look what's got 50 well not 15 well whatever they like they like okay whatever they want to

[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:13.400]
Ditto with that's fine with me one hit wonders we could do this for like the next hundred years you know that Marble

[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:20.400]
It still only has my one vote that that's that's a sin if anything is a sin that's a sin

[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:28.340]
In fact this could be this could be the winter of all time or functions of somebody's life but it's not gonna win today's poll

[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:34.860]
And of course the winter of today's poll now we'll get to carry on next time we do this against whatever other ones

[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:41.920]
We come up with only one survives from today you don't understand that I know it's depressing but oh well not this one's an eco to make it nope you know

[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.280]
Oh

[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:47.660]
Great song

[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:53.760]
Did I mean paper release the night Chicago died has got five votes and that's only got George's vote at least the

[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.320]
Mystics and Hushabai's got four

[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.200]
Mine and three more

[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:03.820]
Dirty bomb suspect has criminal past in Broward from the early 90s. How do you like that? No surprise?

[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:09.400]
Every scumbag every degenerate every low life area trash every

[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.920]
Sunrise police lieutenant Charlie Vitale recognized the name instantly even a decade later

[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:20.100]
Jose Padilla lived in Lauderdale when Vitale arrested him after a road raid shooting incident in 1991

[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.760]
Vitale was a brand new detective on the job for only two years at the time

[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:28.620]
I almost shot him because he went for his gun Vitale said too bad it was almost Charlie

[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:35.740]
Padilla's in a lot more trouble now prosecutors announced yesterday that Padilla now Abdullah Al Mujah here after converting to Islam in the early

[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:41.320]
1990s is part of an al-Qaeda terrorist network that plotted to unleash a radioactive bomb La Bomba in the US

[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.900]
Maybe he listened to Richie valence one time too many you know it maybe put him over the edge

[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.080]
Guess we ain't gonna be here in him no more hungry. We got that there somewhere too, but yeah to La Bomba

[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:58.500]
But he had other hits unfortunately and then of course he died in that plane with the big bopper and buddy Holly buddy Holly

[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.420]
You know something I like buddy Holly, but I think he was a little bit overrated

[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:06.280]
I agree. Thank you for saying that. I mean buddy Holly had you know

[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:10.440]
He was good buddy on the crickets that'll be the day, you know and Peggy Sue

[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:14.160]
He was okay. He was pretty good. Just fine if he hadn't died

[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:19.060]
I mean the fact that he died and I plan crash made him bigger than life itself and a big bopper. I mean

[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:20.760]
You know he was fun

[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.800]
But he had chantilly lace. What else did he have?

[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:24.520]
Dye

[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.040]
Well, I guess I better look at that

[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:31.320]
Yep, get back to that story about Jose Padilla. See we're like mixing and matching today

[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:37.820]
We have lots of filler music by the way for you to look stuff up. Oh, no, I don't need filler music to look stuff up

[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.160]
If I want filler music, I got it right here

[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:49.300]
Oh, yeah, I know John now it's starting to bug me. What am I looking for the big bopper? Yes, he's still dead by the way

[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.700]
He's singing up there. Oh, that's right. He had the big bopper's wedding

[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:57.760]
So he doesn't qualify for one hit wonders because otherwise he would chantilly lace 8458

[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:03.080]
See that's another thing the byproduct of our polls is the age factor see

[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:08.980]
Because I think a tremendous number of our listeners weren't even born when most of these songs were it like Robert there for example

[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:12.500]
What does Robert know about these songs right? I?

[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.680]
Know some not all I mean he knew the the pro-claimers

[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:20.680]
I'm gonna be 500 miles because that was like only nine years ago and he's big on anything from nine years ago

[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:26.520]
Anyway, Padilla to a government interrogators after the rest may aeth in Chicago

[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:31.340]
They turned to Islam while incarcerated in the Barakaday jail and ultimately took his Islamic name

[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:37.260]
Not you love all the all these of jailbirds a good they go to jail and all of a sudden they become like a born again Christians

[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.580]
They become Muslims

[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:45.420]
FBI agent showed up at the sunrise police department about a month ago looking for his fingerprint cards and paperwork by tell said

[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.200]
Like some of the terrorists who flew airplanes in US buildings on 9 11

[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:53.580]
Padilla had ties to South Florida living there from 1990 to release 1997

[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:59.880]
Religious leaders at several local mosques say they did not recognize his name or his photo at the Lake Park Gardens

[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.480]
Condo complex in plantation

[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:07.960]
There was a plaque quoting scripture on a door at the home of Padilla's mother Estella or Tehga as for me and my house

[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:15.140]
We will serve the Lord there was also a statue of a cherub reclining two bows decorated with American flag patterns and a handwritten note

[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.840]
Please leave this family in peace

[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.200]
Victor Olds or Tehga's lawyer said Monday's announcement regarding the so-called dirty bomb plot

[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:30.100]
Cutter off guard and that before Padilla's arrested or here when he arrived from from Pakistan via Zurich holding ten thousand dollars in cash

[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.420]
His mother thought he was coming home to visit his family

[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.520]
She said to me that she never had any information that would have led her to believe that her son was involved in terrorist group old said

[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.760]
She knows that he was in the Middle East for a while, but that's nothing else. She knows

[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.580]
When Jose was for his mother as

[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:48.940]
Estella or Tehga moved him to the west coast while West Chicago rather from Brooklyn and

[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:50.740]
West Chicago they lived in a modest row house

[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.960]
They shared with two other families his father apparently died when he was young neighbors

[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:59.840]
We call that his name was Pucho or Pudgy and that he played softball in the streets Pucho, I guess

[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:05.700]
What do you mean you guess? I never heard that word but law enforcement you're learning something not even ten o'clock

[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:09.940]
And he's already learning esponial here today. This is thick learned in Spanish on the near Roger show

[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:14.220]
But law enforcement sources say he ended up pursuing less benign activities

[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:19.640]
He joined the Latin kings a street gang that used to promote itself as a non-violent source of empowerment for young Latinos

[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:25.380]
Before dozens of its leaders were sent to jail the sources also say was involved in a gang-lang murder when he was only 13

[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:32.040]
On the night of August 1585 to Shiva's 15th birthday Pudgy and five others attacked and robbed three men on Chicago street

[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.660]
Quar Records said one victim was fatally stabbed and Pudgy kicked him in the head

[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.660]
Because he was a juvenile records are not available on what charge Pudgy a face or the outcome of the case in

[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:45.440]
1991 he moved to Florida where he was living with a girlfriend and working at hotels for 200 bucks a week

[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:51.300]
According to a successful workers compensation claim that knitted him an additional five bucks a week and driving a car with tinted windows

[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.440]
And that important that we know that he was driving a car with tinted windows boy

[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.760]
This I've tied to this unsent and although mess around important part of the profile

[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:04.760]
October 891 Pudgy was driving a black Toyota to sell money flashed a handgun and two men another car during a traffic incident

[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:10.960]
Both cars stopped at a gas station Oakland Park Boulevard and University drive where a Pudgy pulled out a gun fired at the windshield and missed the

[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.680]
Court of the police report no one was injured. I know that intersection very well. No the gas station

[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.660]
He was a 20 year old vitality just got angry and popped off around

[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:27.540]
Staking out the house where Pudgy lived with his girlfriend at 2315 Northwest 55th Harrison Lawyer Hill eight hours after the road

[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:32.740]
Regents and it by tell didn't know about Pudgy's extensive arrest record a record that include his involvement in a murder and robbery as a juvenile

[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.880]
Pudgy was walking up to the houseman by telling his partner a yoke from to get to the on the ground

[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.920]
He started backing up and reached into his waistband for the gun before officers of doodam

[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:44.640]
There were only a couple of times I could look back and know for sure that something was very close

[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:50.600]
And that was one of the vital said Pudgy was charged with aggravated assault firing a firearm from a vehicle and carrying concealed weapon

[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.660]
1991 and spent 303 days in Broward County jail

[00:45:55.120 --> 00:46:01.580]
He told police at the time of Zerestead worked for two weeks at the holiday in on University drive and plantation setting up banquet rooms

[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.020]
Boy, this is this is all like too close to home, you know what?

[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.620]
Enrico's on and on and on Pudgy

[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:13.080]
Alive did a number of locations around South Florida including the sundown apartments in Lauderdale

[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:16.780]
Where residents at a yellow and brown garden department complex had never heard of them

[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.120]
Lest in a mile from Lauderdale Lauderdale

[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:24.100]

Minutes later news reporters knocked on his door informative of muha muha jurors a link to his two bedroom one bathroom apartment in the single story

[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:51.580]
Maybe I should say this this could be like valuable someday you know, I doubted

[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:58.040]
It says Bobby Blum and Montego, which is not that and even on the inside when you look at the little insert there

[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:01.860]
It's got to be a descriptor that it says Montego and of course that even the song is Montego Bay

[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.160]
You made a mistake

[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.820]
No matter what you call it it sucks

[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:16.600]
I got the goddy story here and this is gonna take a long this is a very lengthy story from news day and like I told you this morning

[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:25.180]
Every New York paper of course has got lengthy lengthy lengthy articles and editorials and stories and stuff about John

[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:28.220]
Goddy, but I think this one's the best and it goes on forever

[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:38.520]
John goddy once considered America's most powerful mobster, but also the man who helped cause the demise of the modern mafia

[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:44.720]
died yesterday in a federal prison hospital from complications of cancer while serving a life sentence from murder and raccotour

[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:53.200]
Goddy 61 who'd been dubbed the Teflon Don after you escaped convictions and previous trials was convicted in 1992 of raccotouring conspiracy

[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:59.920]
Including six murders and sent to the country's toughest prison US-Pentry had Miriam Illinois with no chance for parole

[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:06.220]
It was transferred to the federal prison hospital in Springfield in the zary last September when his throat cancer became more advanced

[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:12.900]
Goddy was pronounced that at 12.45 pm yesterday and autopsy will be conducted to determine the another interesting

[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:17.580]
He died at 12.45 right and at 12.55

[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:21.640]
10 minutes later I did that story about Peter Goddy and John Goddy you see

[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:27.520]
How do you like that huh as Neil psychic powers again put that mystery out of shame that pony bitch

[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:33.480]
And autopsy what that music's too hot for your reading

[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:41.880]
And autopsy will be conducted to determine the exact cause of his death at a stemolution by prison spokeswoman Diane Smith

[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:47.760]
Roger better the once robust mobster Goddy start and crime as a queen struck hijacker

[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.800]
hijacker become steadily debilitated

[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:53.380]
Unable to do any physical activity or take solid food in his final days

[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:55.280]
So that's good news. We like you're an aunt

[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:57.820]
Unless of course you happen to be a mafia fan

[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:03.520]
Just like somebody would say that we were upset when sentino or we were happy when sentino got shot on a causeway

[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:06.220]
We were Christball and when sonny got shot on a causeway

[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:07.660]
Look what they do boy

[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:09.440]
Yeah you idiot

[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:10.900]
I

[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:18.400]
Often referred to with the dapper dawn because of his flamboyant attire the silver-haired Goddy became the boss of the Gambino organized crime family following that a

[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.920]
Sebra 16th 1985 slang of his predecessor

[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:26.560]
Podcast the Lana outside of sparkstake house in midtown manhattan remember where I'm sure you've seen it on TV

[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:32.060]
The pictures they showed in the newspapers are the bloody pictures of bloody pictured man. What a mess

[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:37.360]
Goddy's orchestration of the Christmas time assassination of Castelano and Vodka guard Thomas Balotti

[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:41.120]
Was a naked gram per power which befitted his brutal leadership style

[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:43.080]
And the yellow delacroche

[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:48.440]
Goddy's mob meant to run under boss of the Gambino crime family had dampened the repetiastness of younger members of the crime family

[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.440]
The satisfied with Castelano's rule

[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:55.660]
But the death of delacroche on December 2nd 85 removed the last impediment to the killing of Castelano

[00:54:55.660 --> 00:55:01.280]
Who was viewed by many in the mob as a greedy everwishes boss be set by legal problems that made him vulnerable

[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:06.380]
The fact that some of Goddy's crew from the Bergenhund and Fish Club in Ozone Park including brother Gene

[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:10.840]
Had been implicated in heroin traffic something banned by Castelano under penalty of death

[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:17.440]
Forced the aspiring mobster to strike first before he was killed because of the drug dealing the Castelano hit card the rest of the mob off guard

[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:26.920]
Goddy had very little choice had run gold stock from ahead of the state organized crime strike force in the 80s about the Castelano hit and because Goddy was so first and then ruthless

[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.200]
There was a no uh

[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:34.920]
There was no to nobody to go against him. Well, I've misprinted there in news day back. There was no to go against him

[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:41.900]
The highlight of his last trial in a federal courtwoman Brooklyn came when Goddy's former underbar Salvatore Gravano

[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:46.920]
Testified that Goddy directed the killing of Castelano and sat with Gravano in a car less than a block away

[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:51.340]
While a team of his henchmen shot down Castelano in a close aid like we just said moment to go

[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:52.460]
Thomas Vallotti

[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:58.660]
During his reign and at least up until his imprisonment Goddy ruled the crime family with an iron fist

[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:05.480]
But it was his mouth specifically secret mutterings about his crimes picked up by hidden FBI bugs that landed Goddy in prison

[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.120]
On January 17th 1990 and a tape Goddy was heard talking about his love for the mafia

[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.600]
And this is going to be a Kosa Nosha till I die

[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:16.680]
He said be it an hour from now or be it tonight or a hundred years from now when I'm in jail

[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:19.380]
It's going to be the way I say it's going to be a Kosa Nosha

[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:20.780]
our thing

[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:28.260]
But the irony is that Goddy's musings profanities and indiscretions caught on the surveillance tapes are now viewed by most experts

[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:33.360]
As the major piece of ammunition federal and state investigation needed to cripple a Kosa Nosha in New York City

[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:38.940]
Goddy gotty no no he brought attention to himself with a flashy lifestyle that included two thousand dollar bioni suits

[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.440]
Kind of like what's his name? They're like Joey Zaza

[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.180]
Maybe someday he'll make you famous too, remember that I remember

[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:49.540]
Hey sure. I have a Bella Fagura, but hey Joey

[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:50.700]
Zaza

[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:54.600]
Anyway, not only were two thousand dollar bioni suits like Greg Reed

[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:59.340]
But he was also unable to avoid electronic surveillance. He when he knew he was the target of investigators a gold stock

[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:05.920]
Some of the most damaging tapes were made at the apartment of an elderly widow above the Ravenite social club on Mulberry Street in little Italy

[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:11.820]
The recordings were used at the federal trial of Goddy in his underlings in 1992 and convictions in the case effectively

[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:17.720]
Decapitated leadership of the Gambino crime family leaving a power vacuum filled unsuccessfully for the most part by inept leaders

[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:20.720]
including Goddy's son John a Goddy known as junior

[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:30.240]
He brought the Gambino family to its knees and Andy Currens a former FBI special agent who investigated the crime family

[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:36.120]
Guys he put in charge were loyal to him to the extent of anything else not people who were earners or had any respect and organized crime circles

[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:43.260]
He was the epitome of the thug said Joseph coffee a private investigator who has city police detective also progody in the crime family

[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:47.500]
He ruled strictly by intimidation as opposed to mother mob figures like Luciano who was smart

[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:50.560]
Lansky who was smart not dumb like Frado but smart

[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:54.140]
Despite his pension for crime in mayhem Goddy had a keen sense of humor

[00:57:54.620 --> 00:58:03.060]
But some of his anthics in court done for the benefit of reporters only served to incents prosecutors and FBI agents who would target it and for him for prosecution kind like Al Goldstein

[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:11.580]
For example in his 1992 trial Goddy once blew a kiss toward a prosecutor at another point when it appeared that defensive attorneys have caught a witness in a contradiction

[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:16.280]
Goddy drew an imaginary pistol from his waistband and fired off some fake bullets for FBI agents

[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:22.880]
During one rest break Goddy pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wrapped it around his face in the best imitation of a western bandit

[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.480]
During jury selection U.S. district judge

[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:31.440]
I. Leo Glasser threatened to move the trial of another city because of the media coverage when the judge briefly left the conference room

[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:37.340]
Goddy said we're going to move it stutka at West Germany his words both in and out of court were often a profane

[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:40.320]
On tapes played at his trials got mommy better stop right there

[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:40.560]

Yes, you're gonna go way over why don't want to go over to break we gotta come back to it come back to stuttgart

[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:49.840]
Or as they say as some of the egoims say stuttgart

Rogers on sports whole radio

It's a new book that's shocking the country after 20 years shaggy of Scooby-Doo speaks out

[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:24.780]
Just closing the behind the scenes antics that could bring down the whole cartoon industry

[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:29.900]
Oh my god. I tell you oh like we weren't just solving mysteries in that mystery van right school

[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:34.520]
Like we used to have a bumper sticker on the back that said when this van's a rock and don't come on

[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:36.240]
And

[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:42.800]
I got to tell you film and ethnic lesbian city carpet munchers belly robin. Yep. I know what's hard to believe

[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:47.560]
scrappy do like the only reason like he got his job he was pimping for Daphne

[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.680]
Like how about Fred like how many guys do you know the where yellow scar?

[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:59.660]
Like that's right. Scooby and I used to sit in the front of the mystery van and like do ball hits and like watch film and Daphne get it on

[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.680]
Like what do you think we ate so much

[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:03.700]
It's the new book

[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:05.540]
Scooby-Doo

[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:13.100]
Like you would have got away with it had it not been for those damn kids on book shelves across the country everywhere

[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:46.180]
You

[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.900]
Remember that don't you yep you do oh

[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:51.580]
Yeah, don't I

[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:57.160]
The new radicals you get what you give which actually was an album cover which made it number 36 on the chart

[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.100]
I don't know how they all you do that. I have the CD

[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:05.620]
Anyway, did you know this little known fact that the group new radicals is actually soda rock singer musician Greg Alexander?

[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.860]
No, I did not know that well now you know that

[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:16.200]
From the album maybe you've been brainwashed to on MCA or whatever the hell new radicals a medley of their smash so there you go

[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.700]
That's not on a list of obvious reasons

[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.980]
I'm a little bit skeptical about that soft sell and tainted love aren't you I don't buy it for a second?

[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:27.620]
About that because it's the corny is one on there that they recognize

[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.920]
I beg your pardon the game players. That's the corny a song on there that they recognize

[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:39.820]
Well, I don't think that's the cornyest one. I won't buy again that they recognize the night Chicago die these punks

[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.300]
They don't know any of these older ones like the night Chicago died

[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:48.940]
They don't know how corny those are unbelievable by eMF has got six. It's well. Whatever. It's gonna be. It's gonna be okay

[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:52.440]
Just calm down. I'll get back to my John Gotti crap. Oh, please

[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.000]
Like I said, it's long and it's very long his words both in and out of court were often profane

[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:06.160]
Untaped played at his trials. Gotti could be heard uttering expletives after losing huge bets on slow horses and lackluster football teams

[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.440]
And while blasting mobsters who not show them respect

[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:14.660]
At his last trial appearing without his long-time attorney Bruce Cutler have been disqualified because of legal conflicts

[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:17.840]
Gotta gave the appearance of a man who realized he was going down to the feet

[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.900]
On several occasions in loud a size. He called the judge in prosecutors faggots and worse

[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:23.940]
Faggots

[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:32.320]
Gotti who lived in a white clappboard house and Howard Beach that sports a large satellite TV dish was practically unknown publicly when he took over leadership of the Gambino

[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.000]
Cran family

[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:40.820]
But he soon gained the status of a fokia with him any because of his acquittals expensive suits hand-painted silk ties and swash buckling ways

[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:45.280]
Though married to Victoria L.D. Georgia in the early 1960s

[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:51.280]
Gotti reportedly was link romantically to blonde beauty Lisa Gastino from a wife of jets football star Mark Gastino

[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:57.420]
Remember guard Mark Gastino who was done was it him that was Diana? Was it her that was dying? I don't know

[01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.360]
Robert would know

[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.980]
What one day she was dying then the next day she wasn't fine

[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:08.200]
Well, maybe that maybe somebody made it off or she couldn't refuse, huh? Maybe that's what that was all about

[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:14.720]
Gotti a one-time petty thief and hijacker worked his way up through the mob the hard way by earning respect and being ruthless

[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:18.020]
Way needed to be born in the South Bronx October 27th

[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:24.280]
John Joseph Gotti was the fifth of thirteen children raised by his father John a construction worker and mother Fanny

[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.840]
Immigrants from the Naples region of Italy. Dinapoli. Napoli

[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.100]
Ever been to Naples

[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.360]
Florida

[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.460]
That's what I'm talking about toilet

[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:38.320]
When he was 12 them and by the way you people over there in Naples the beesleys giving my checks on time

[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:42.280]
Okay, I appreciate the ones that are a day early previous but let's get them there on time you assholes

[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:46.020]

[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.200]
Prince

[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.280]
Bruce Springsteen

[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.340]
And Simon and Garfunkel

[01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:01.380]
Universal's the only major label not not participating in rhapsody in your pants

[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:08.920]
PJ McNeely a top digital music aim list with consultants gardener G2 said for listeners by far the most significant internet service provider deal

[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:14.340]
That's been struck for like hosts an incremental step in a strategy of offering more paid services to grow revenues

[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:22.100]
Nignely said he thinks listen dot com's got a good chance of becoming much more popular than the industry sponsored streaming music sites music net and press play

[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:27.380]
Those each have only three of the five labels participating cap how many songs can be downloaded per month

[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:31.440]
And I've never disclosed how many subscribers they've attracted from our user standpoint

[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:37.560]
Listen as perhaps the most advanced of the services that are out there because all the deals they have structured with record labels McNeely said

[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:45.800]
But McNeely said a major limiting factor on the potential priority of like coaster our popularity of like host rhapsody is that the services are tied to your PC

[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:52.200]
Which is a problem for people who want to be able to download songs and save them listen to later on a portable music player or like in their car

[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:56.240]
Or like on something with like good speakers, you know what I mean? I know it might like sound like a real song

[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.360]
Like music

[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:04.560]
McNeely said gardener estimates only 16% of adults regularly listen to streaming music at home or work

[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:10.640]
And a big question is how many people would rather spend 120 dollars a year for continuous one-time access to songs instead of buying CDs

[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.620]
They can keep or other options which we of course will mention

[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:19.980]
Sean Ryan the chief executive of listen dot com studies competent users will find the wraps of the system a simple

[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:25.660]
Easily understandable way to get access to music without the risk of introducing viruses to their computer by using illegal

[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:28.240]
Napster inspired music sharing services. That's right

[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:33.020]
Don't be using that illegal stuff. You risk introducing a virus to your thing

[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:36.140]
I would never and there's nothing worse than having a virus in your thing

[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.980]
Digital music should be for all users. It's not for the very young with the very geeky or the very cutting edge Ryan said

[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:43.900]
It's just for people to want choice

[01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:48.140]
It shouldn't be challenging. It shouldn't be threatening. It's just be another way to get music you want to listen to

[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:55.980]

[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:41.760]
I let all my pussy but my pussy wasn't there

[01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:46.200]
Well well well my cat fell in the well

[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:50.880]
Oh, push, push, push, push, push, get a kid a kid like that fell in the well

[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:55.720]
I got a letter and I climbed down to my fence

[01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:00.740]
I saw in the jeep that my pussy was soaking wet

[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:01.280]
Oh, right

[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:05.100]

Then I want to get in her mouth that's pretty as pussy that fell in the well

[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:24.240]
Then there was a pussy that could quite compare with her

[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:28.640]
Really has a picture with her long and soaking fur

[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:33.220]
Well, well, well, well my cat fell in the well

Oh, push, push, push, push, push, get a kid a kid like that fell in the well

[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:42.620]
If you had a pussy that you wouldn't try to sell

[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:47.480]
Never left her wander or she might fall in the well

[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:52.080]

Yeah, there's a lot of these on here that are fairly obscure and is one disc that I've got

[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.820]
For example, I don't think I play this on here

[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:30.800]
Did I?

[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:31.340]
No

[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.020]
Anybody ever heard this?

[01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:37.840]
Oh no

[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:39.020]
You did?

[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:41.340]
It was a picture five minutes

[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:42.620]
All over the place

[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:43.560]
Couldn't get rid of it

[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:45.160]

[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:02.560]
What?

[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:04.480]
There's a mistake on this disc

[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:05.580]
Uh oh

[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:06.780]
Because I just looked it up in the book

[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:09.500]
They also had do you want crying which you only got to 37

[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:13.160]
But you know one hit wonder should be somebody that only had one like in the top four

[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.540]
And they also had that's the way which reach number 16

[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:16.420]
Guess what?

[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.280]

Katrina and the waves not a one hit wonder

[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:43.080]

[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:45.900]
Well, we looked uh had egg on our post you know what?

[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.800]
Something as important as this and then even though this one's got the right name of the song

[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.880]
This is a different group doing Montego Bay

[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:54.120]

[01:24:55.940 --> 01:24:57.100]
Ever hear this? No

[01:24:58.300 --> 01:24:59.460]
Want to hear it? No

[01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:01.760]
Oh it's my favorite song

[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:14.780]
I don't like the song in the first place by Bobby Blan or by uh Amazulu or any other Zulu

[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:16.620]
Him wild

[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:21.000]
You keep me hanging on the song that definitely didn't need to be done again

[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.600]
That's a one hit wonder

[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.960]
What happened? This is what happened to be America

[01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:33.360]

[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.960]
Million times an hour

[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.240]

No this this now this disc is called one hit wonderful volume two

[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:56.460]
More hard to find one hit wonders which is why I brought it

[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:02.860]
Because when you see when you're looking for this and you see where this that specifically says that and then you look it up in your book and you realize

[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:09.260]
That the crap you realize you've been had you've been led down to freaking garden path Kim wild my ass

[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.740]
That that song didn't need to be done again. No it did not

[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:30.120]
Supremes done just a fine job on that and kids in America which I know everyone to hear that again

[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:34.880]
So we just continue and now this one I'm sure that there's nobody else done this

[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:37.200]

[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:40.200]

I thought it was Axel X

[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:16.180]
Axel F F as in fake

[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:18.860]
F as in fascist

[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:22.820]

It's a preview inquiring. No, it's not a preview. It inquiring minds. Well, we better do some investigative work in

[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:38.960]
Maybe we can find the answers on that nifty website that Eric talked us about yesterday

[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.620]
Even though it doesn't exist. I'm sure you just got it wrong

[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:43.940]
No, I wrote it down exactly the way he

[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:49.940]
Passed it along to us and then not only that but I checked every other possible variation out on the above thing

[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:55.520]
Doesn't exist you tried it with hyphens. I tried it with hyphens with hyphens with everything that exists

[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:59.740]
Nice try area. Although he did straighten out the name of that song my baby loves love

[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.200]
My wife plans against still don't have any votes

[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:07.240]
Nobody but me by the human beings you know the fact that nobody but me by the human beings has gotten no votes

[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:12.760]
Is another reason I'm glad I'm not in song for a man some of you people your taste is deep inside your echo man

[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:14.780]

God how is that possible nobody but me by the human beings

[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:27.380]

[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:31.860]
In every commercial like I said yesterday. There's a zillion commercials based on that song

[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:38.840]
Well there's something really really wrong no one of the music is so bad and soft-foot on fm. You know

[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:44.360]

Gabe Kaplan Gabe Kaplan why didn't like him either no there was just something about him

[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.160]
You always he always acted kind of like Gabe I

[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:11.420]
Just think you're an anti-Semite if a person here's a fact you just a similar all from a chronic Tim pots chronic

[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:13.560]
Hey Tim

[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:18.900]
For person has an editing software like cool edit pro tools or Vegas pro they can never

[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:22.760]
And see we're not gonna like promote stuff like that

[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:28.620]
Convert it and burn your CD no we don't though. Oh, he says play Indiana wants me now you're talking to him now

[01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:32.920]
You start to make some progress and how's mom doing remember Tim pots and this does awful comedy CDs

[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:39.320]
Oh, yeah, yeah, I had forgotten all about that and is a chronic factor in a terminal neatly and just obsessed

[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:42.380]
But he's okay means well just that he's a little off, you know

[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:47.560]
He's once there Indiana wants me by our Dean Taylor which now how many votes is that god if that doesn't have a lot of votes

[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:51.320]
I'm walking out I'm getting up and walking into the other room for while anyway

[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.640]
Indiana wants I don't see it

[01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:00.640]
Uh, ah two votes. Oh man

[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:07.500]
Jesus K Christ and Joseph Indiana wants me by our Dean Taylor's got two votes

[01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:12.240]
The best one hit wonder of all time. There's something wrong with this to do that town

[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.340]
There's something in the drinking water. I don't want to start any rumors

[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:18.080]
But it can't just be plain stupidity or bad taste

[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:22.000]
Yeah, of course they must have bad taste to listen to this show

[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:28.120]
Johnny Taylor John Taylor James Taylor. Oh, where the hell's our Dean Taylor

[01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:32.380]
Whenever he's something if he's not in here. Oh, here it is

[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:40.200]
Made number five in 1970 in September of 1970 our Dean Taylor born in Toronto, no less in 1939 a

[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:45.920]
First pressing featured sirens on the intro, but evidently after that they took him off

[01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:51.140]
You know what I think that might have been what I think you don't remember they passed that thing on radio

[01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:55.560]
You're not supposed to play things with the sirens and stuff like that yet freaks people out when they're driving in their car

[01:31:55.560 --> 01:32:00.020]
No, no, it's not just that it freaks them out, but it's you're not supposed to play him because it's like a false alarm

[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:06.900]
Right for the reason you just said anyway Indiana wants me was number five was on the charts for 13 weeks on rare earth records

[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:10.080]
It was a medley of his smash and it's got two lousy votes

[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:15.720]
God, and I'm looking at bokeh brine didn't send that one to me. I'm gonna go out that and buy that today

[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:21.280]
In spite of all these suggestions of downloading stuff and stealing music all these terrible things

[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:23.800]
Who the hell do you think we are here a bunch of thieves or what?

[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:26.240]
God crazy person

[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:31.820]
I'll have you know that both of these CDs I went on what the with the Recrappy Canadian money. It's not worth too much

[01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:34.000]
I went out there and bought yesterday at Sam's

[01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:39.480]
Which is still in business downtown by the way even though they they got bought out and they were like going out of business

[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:43.160]
And I don't know who they'll bought them, but they the places like in it perpetually looks like it's out of business

[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:45.260]
But it's open you know what I mean I do

[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:51.360]
Kind of like they can't make up their mind in fact last night they had a midnight sale and

[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:54.640]
They were like had a whole bunch of brand new releases that were being sold a midnight

[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:57.420]
I'm pleased to say an encounter like that yeah

[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:00.260]
look like closed. yeah like Q-A-M

[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:05.800]
Like yesterday 1056 and 560 WKM the good news is we got the logs today

[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:09.000]
We got everybody's mail today. They got their black sacks today

[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.260]
What the more could you want?

[01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:16.480]
Except, Halitz's 2002 Near Rogers Neal Deal blowout sale in the good news is that's going on right now too.

[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:20.640]
Life is great. Stop by Halitz Pontiac GMC say how to Tom Laman say,

[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:25.760]

[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:28.920]

And right now the lower sale prices marked right on the invoice and all 2002 cars and trucks and stock.

If you're real nice, Tom will read it to you. Choose 1.9% financing up to a $3,500 rebate.

[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:43.560]
Why do you at Halitz? Be sure and take a peek at the complete line of GMC SUVs,

[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:48.200]
including the Envoy, which by now you should know, was voted by Motor Trend as DSUV of the year.

[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:53.500]
Plus, take a peek at the all-new Vibes SUV that's got the power of a sports car at a fraction of the price.

[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:57.280]
And as always, Halitz got a great selection of dependable pre-owned cars,

[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:02.460]
trucks and SUVs waiting for you to. If you return down for credit by some of douchebag, a car dealer somewhere,

[01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:05.300]
if you're not good enough for the other guys, you're good enough for Halitz,

[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:08.440]
they'll get you deal worked out somehow, even if you knew you have to forest.

[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.160]
How come they were picking on him again this morning?

[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:15.020]
Who was? The audience. I mean, Motor is credit. He and the guilty defendant,

[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:18.040]
and but the audience was like picking on him like being a scumbag. We like Diffle,

[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:22.460]
and by the way, he's doing great. It's the Tuta, and by the way, a Tom Lehman like some too,

[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:55.560]
You call that a hairy penis?

[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:59.940]
Coming up tonight on Inside the Behind the True Hollywood celebrity music

[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:05.000]
biography profile story. We take a good, hard, stiff look into startup.

[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:11.260]
Their infectious pop-stylings infected us with an infection until we took some antibiotics

[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:15.040]
and a thing for the one away in a week or so. They were to pow.

[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:28.360]
People are all you're asking us where we got the name to pow.

[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:33.900]
In this weird interview, the power leads singer Carol Decker makes the rash assumption

[01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:37.480]
that we give a flying f*** about her in her stupid band.

[01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:43.680]
Well, to pow was a character on Star Trek. She was a vulcan high priestess.

[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:49.040]
Interesting enough, confessing that she named her band after a Star Trek character,

[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:53.860]
branded Carol Decker as such a hopeless geek that it prevented her from getting laid during

[01:35:53.860 --> 01:36:00.180]
your entire tenure as a famous person. It's ironic, you know, because as you probably know,

[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:05.940]
Vulcan's have to mate with every seven years or they like explode.

[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:12.260]
Why no, Carol, you annoying strange person. We didn't know that. But let me ask you this.

[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.100]
If the band to pow doesn't have a hit every seven years, do they explode too?

[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:23.440]
Well, I don't know. I mean, like, what are you getting at? I mean, will he had that one

[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:31.060]
hit and has been well over time? Ladies and gentlemen, a little glimpse of what the world

[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:37.400]
would be like if TV show announcers had all the power. It's a big juicy, shopping-wet

[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:43.740]
luggage show business tonight on Inside the Mind. You know what? I think we made a mistake.

[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:49.500]
We we. We we. Yeah, I think the name of that star. I mean Eric made a mistake, but that

[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:54.380]
goes without saying. My baby loves loving is the name of that. I think you're right.

[01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:59.560]
We're in a positive here at the end. Oh, sorry, Eric. Did you look it up? I just looked it up.

[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:05.360]
Well, they kind of mumbled it. Let's see, question, a question mark in

[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:08.340]
the series are from Bay City and Saginaw Michigan. Just like I said, how do you like that?

[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:14.620]
There's also a Saginaw Bay City in Midland, Texas. So in other words, maybe that's where they got

[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:20.140]
the mistake in Billboard, but they are definitely from Saginaw, Michigan makes no mistake about that

[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:23.420]
because I was living in Michigan and playing that on the radio at the time. How do you like them,

[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:29.120]
apples? I feel I know my Michigan boy and baby. So anyway, Tapao speaking of that was next time we

[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:32.960]
do this. Yeah, whenever the hell the mood strikes like maybe tomorrow or four weeks, whenever

[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:38.600]
the hell I feel like it, you know, I kind of enjoy it. Even though we get bogus votes, Tapao,

[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:42.800]
pop rap, we'll put them on here next time. Pop rock group from Shrewsbury, England.

[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:48.320]
Carol Decker vocals, Bering Howard guitar, Mick Chetwood keyboards, Paul Jackson bass,

[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:52.840]
and Timberges drums. Van name after a Vulcan princess, an episode of the TV series Star Trek.

[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:59.780]
Did you know that? Yeah, I shouldn't admit that. Oh, you were the one.

[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:05.060]
Heart and Soul reached number four in 87. That was a medley of their smash. So Tapao will be

[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:10.480]
on there one of these days. By the way, something. Yes, I don't know what site you were looking for,

[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:15.040]
that one hit wonder central dot com. He's already he already put it up there in an

[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:20.540]
blazing green on my okay, because I hate here. One hit wonder central website is one hit wonder

[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:26.040]
central dot com. Okay. Thank you, Eric. It's great. He's trying to rub it in now just because

[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:30.020]
he made a mistake on white planes and we made a mistake on her too. So I do like that. Take that.

[01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:36.460]
Take that, Mr. Hatch. Hot. Soft cell and tainted loves got 36. Are you do by that for a minute?

[01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:45.060]
No, looking glass by Brandy 16. I mean, Brandy's the name of the song. See, that's interesting.

[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.640]
You look at some of these and you can't tell what's the name of the group in the song, but we know

[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:52.340]
what it is. Brandy or a fine bitch. A Norman Greenbaum, a spirit in the sky. I also got 16.

[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:59.320]
Mountain Mississippi Queen 15. Zaguar and Evans in the year 2525 has got 13. And then it's downhill

[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:03.100]
from there. No, no, no, no, no, hey, hey, it's got 12. Now, where is the Indiana wants to be by our

[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:10.080]
Dean Taylor? That better have a one or two more votes. I'm going to be two. Oh, oh my God.

[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:16.220]
I'll tell you, I knew before the show started. There was no God, but now I know for sure positive.

[01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:21.500]
Hey, you want a good laugh? Here's a great story for from the Sun Central Day. I was good for a few

[01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:27.980]
chuckles. Boint and officials say power company will help build Marlon Stadium there. That's right.

[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.840]
When City Commissioner Mike Ferguson suggested building a stadium for the Florida Marlins in

[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:39.500]
Boint and Beach last year is proposal was met with laughter and ridicule. But Ferguson says the idea

[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:43.500]
is no laughing matter. And now he's found a company to bankroll part of it, but he won't identify

[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:48.860]
the potential financial backer. In a June 1st letter to Marlon's president David Samson,

[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:53.320]
Ferguson says he has an offer from an unnamed California based power generation company

[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:58.580]
to spend maybe and run to spend $350 million on the project. The company would supply

[01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:03.000]
power to baseball stadium using state-of-the-art technology letter states Ferguson said yesterday he

[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:08.520]
couldn't reveal the name of the company. Otherwise more laughter probably would start. In May 2001,

[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:13.220]
Ferguson proposed building a 400 to $500 million $65,000 seat stadium where they were

[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:19.460]
tractable roof inside Quantum Corporate Parkoff I 95. I'm sure a lot of us would drive all

[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:24.300]
the way up there to Boint and Beach to see tomorrow, wouldn't you? Yeah. Robert would go.

[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:31.740]
He got free tickets. I'd go if I got free food like at the sky box and like a free helicopter ride.

[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:36.620]
Limo, the idea raised more than a few eyebrows but Ferguson said he remained serious about

[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:40.400]
attracting the Marlon's to Boint and Beach. Ferguson said two thirds of the team's four

[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:45.420]
thousand season ticket holders come from Broward, Palm Beach and Martin counties, but Samson said

[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:49.280]
that number seemed a little bit high. Well maybe Commissioner Ferguson was a little high when he

[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:53.220]
gave out those numbers. During last night's Marlon's game in Kansas City, which the Marlon's won,

[01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:59.860]
by the way next reading. What was it? The 15th eight? Robert doesn't know. Something like that.

[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:05.320]
You know something you work on a show where all they talk about is soccer and basketball and

[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:10.160]
little bit of baseball and you don't know the score last night's Marlon game. I'm pretty sure they

[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:14.920]
said it went. I'm pretty sure that it went 14 innings and a Marlon scored seven on the top of

[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:20.100]
the 14th and one 15th eight. I believe so. Does it make a difference? No, no. There were 500

[01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:24.020]
team. During last night's Marlon game in Kansas City, Samson said it wouldn't be fair to comment

[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:28.160]
further till he reads a proposal. Ferguson estimates the cost of building the stadium is closer to 500

[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.700]
million. He said he based that figure on other stadiums built around the country. He suggests

[01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:35.640]
baseball could spend about 100 million of the total cost with some of it coming from the Marlon's

[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:39.380]
to baseball commissioners office and the players union pension. Another 50 million could come from

[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:43.800]
the local county, state and federal agencies. He said Ferguson said the quantum pike started because

[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:48.520]
of its proximity to I-95 in the trial rail station was crucial to the deal. It's right by the trial

[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:53.700]
rail. Oh, you want to have a board? Asked whether the unnamed California based company

[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:57.320]
seemed serious about its offer. He said I would think there'd have to be some due diligence done,

[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:02.040]
but when somebody surfaces with $350 million worth of bonds, I think they have to be given some

[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:07.080]
sort of credibility. He said Ferguson said he could give no details about the proposal to issue

[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:11.460]
bonds. Major League baseball and the Major League Players Association both said they hadn't seen

[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:16.240]
the letter and couldn't comment. Everybody is mum. The Marlins have a lease at PP Park in North

[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:20.940]
State County through 2003 with 7 and 1 year options after that. Since new owners took over the

[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:24.880]
team in February, the Marlins have avoided talk of a new stadium and focused instead on the team's

[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:29.180]
500 performance. The team officials repeatedly have stressed that they generate more revenue

[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:33.460]
particularly at PP Park where the team's lease favors H. Wayne High Pingo who owns the stadium

[01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:37.300]
and once on the team as we know before he sold them down the river. Last week, where'd emerged the

[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:40.960]
team that has had preliminary discussions with the University of Miami about moving into the

[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:47.100]
Orange Bull in 2004, temporarily, as a way to generate more revenue. Right. Now what's it going

[01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:54.860]
to be about a 75-foot home run down the lines in the Orange Bull? 110 feet. No, seriously, the

[01:42:54.860 --> 01:43:01.180]
Orange Bull is not configured for baseball. Isn't it old and ready to collapse? Yes. A dump, a toilet.

[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:05.940]
Point and beach Mayor Gerald Broning said he thought the letter has great merit in the ideas worth

[01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:10.260]
pursuing if the company's offer is legitimate. I think it's a good scheme, Broning said. I think

[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:13.640]
somebody would have to go through the formal procedure and all of the bells and whistles to do it.

[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:17.880]
So there you go. The Boynton Beach Marlins. Let's hear it. They're doing it baby and Boynton Beach.

[01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:24.120]
I told you to get a chuckle or two out of that. Here's another one you might get a chuckle or two out

[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:29.040]
of in a sadistic way known what a prick you are. George? Yes. Vatican accused Kentucky Bishop

[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:34.380]
resigns. This one we had a story on and now he's out. Bishop J. Kendrick Williams of Lexington,

[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:38.260]
Kentucky accused in several sex abuse cases resigned yesterday. The Vatican be saying

[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:43.140]
the bishop who is denied the charges has been on administrative leave. The Vatican said the

[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:47.280]
Pope accepted the resignation submitted under church law for illness or some other grave reason.

[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:53.280]
In lawsuits against the Archdiocese three plaintiffs alleged abuse by Williams. James W.

[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:57.140]
Bennett alleged Williams abused him in 1981 while Bennett was a 12 year old altar boy.

[01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:01.460]
David Hall, the alleged Williams, followed him when Hall was an 18 year old high school senior,

[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:05.840]
a third plaintiff who filed suit last week also accuses Williams of molesting him when Williams

[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:09.980]
was a priest in Louisville. In a statement last week, Williams said I have never sexually abused

[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:15.200]
anyone at any time in my life. Do you believe me? No. Williams is the third bishop brought down in the

[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:19.120]
sex abuse scandal rocking the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. in January. The announcement of his

[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:23.660]
resignation comes two days before American bishops meet in Dallas to decide on proposals to deal

[01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:27.240]
with sexual abuse and the clergy and how to cover all of this up. How to cover their ass.

[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:33.900]
Monk shooting the river on motive remains mystery. Remember I asked yesterday about the Abbey? Right?

[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:40.180]
Well, a Roman Catholic Abbey in conception of Missouri is that I guess that is because it's with the T.

[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:45.780]
It's not not a Spanish name. Look. A Roman Catholic Abbey erupted in gunfire as a 71 year old man

[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:49.380]
wheeling two assault weapons killed two monks and moved into others before committing suicide,

[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:52.900]
leading bewildered residents in conception Missouri wondering about a motive.

[01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:57.280]
Interviews with relatives and neighbors of Lloyd Robert Jeffries, a Jeffress.

[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:01.600]
Or maybe didn't like his last name Jeffress, J-E-F-F-R-E-S-S.

[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:05.180]
Healed that no clues is to either be tarry packed two rifles and separate boxes,

[01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:09.500]
drove his green Chevy cavalier to far Northwest Missouri on Monday and then opened fire

[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:13.600]
in the hallway of the conception Abbey official set. Investigators were digging in a Jeffress

[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:17.020]
religious past but there was no immediate indication if the shootings were related to the sex

[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:19.840]
scandal in which priest around the country had been accused of molesting youngsters.

[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:24.220]
Jeffress also did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or booze and had no known criminal past.

[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:29.140]
It doesn't make much sense to have a patrol sergeant sheld in lion's set and makes you wonder what

[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:31.360]
goes through a person's mind to make him do something like this.

[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:36.040]
Griefstrick and residents in conception about 90 miles north of Kansas City offered prayer,

[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:39.900]
food and flowers to those at the Benedictine monastery and seminary. The doors of the conception

[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:43.680]
Abbey were locked for the first time in a recent memory overnight and a highway patrolman stood guard.

[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:48.460]
The Reverend Gregory Poland, Abbott of the Abbey City, mistook the first shot as a window breaking,

[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.860]
the monks and staff varicated themselves in their rooms when they realized shots were being fired.

[01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:54.580]
The whole thing lasted about five minutes, maybe even less Poland said.

[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:59.520]
Investigators interviewed Jeffress's daughter in Norbourne laid Monday but gained no insight into

[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:03.900]
a possible motive. How do you like that apple, saw? They're shooting the monks, which brings back great

[01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:07.180]
memories of the monks in though. I'll tell you that was a great place. You never got to eat there,

[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:11.760]
huh? No, I never. Ah! Man was that good. That was back in the days when South Florida was worth

[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:16.820]
being in. Speaking of food, let me tell you about getting in shape for a summertime. Maybe you want

[01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:20.160]
to go to the beach, put out a bathing suit. You certainly don't want to look like a beached whale.

[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:27.140]
The beast is lost 32 pounds on balance for life. This man is a shadow hoodie, any store fat tub.

[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:30.820]
But he's a shadow hoodie once was and we're going to get him on a road to like being healthy

[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:34.860]
and looking human, maybe you can get laid sometime before the year is out. Do you think so? Ah,

[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:38.000]
well, let's not get carried away. That'll be like saying we're going to get clearance laid

[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.600]
before the year is out. Anyway, the beast in a bathing suit, maybe that's coming to a beach near

[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.520]
you pretty soon. Watch out. Balance for life is the answer to losing that weight. It's a bitch. I

[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:50.320]
can tell you personally, losing weight. I mean, you try atkins and scatkins and this program and

[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:54.560]
that one balance for life is based on Dr. Barry Sears' The Zone diet, which is extraordinarily

[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:58.100]
complicated, but they take all the work out of it for you because they prepare all the meals.

[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:02.540]
The best ingredients that money can buy, three delicious or motley balanced gourmet meals, two

[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:06.540]
delicious snacks and little 60 Nautz bottle water in your little black sack, which they deliver to

[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:10.960]
you just about every day at six o'clock in the morning to homework where we might be. They insist

[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:14.820]
they deliver that one yesterday, but we doubt it. Anyway, if you want to get on a road to

[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:18.340]
losing some weight and don't forget they let you choose between two alternatives for each meal each

[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:22.060]
day or on a program. Get in shape for summer and the rest of your life studying right now with

[01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:26.060]
balance for life. Like I said, the food is delicious and it really works. The weight comes pouring

[01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:30.760]
off just like on the beast column today, nine five four five six eight thirty two twenty nine.

[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:36.280]

Four years ago you gave me your nominations to be five pretzels.

[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:08.480]
This is some grab. I've been watching you during that macarena on television.

[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:17.120]
And if I did have your silence, I would like to demonstrate for you.

[01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:22.940]
The Al Gore version of the macarena.

[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:24.040]
I'm not trying to.

[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:27.380]
Macarena.

[01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:36.280]
Macarena. Would you like to see it again?

[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:49.920]
When you're alarm goes off in the morning.

[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:54.580]
Macarena. When one of your children reaches for cereal and fruit.

[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:55.400]
Macarena.

[01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:58.140]
Macarena.

[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:01.640]
Macarena.

[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:02.740]
Macarena.

[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:04.320]
Macarena.

[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:06.240]
Macarena.

[01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:09.820]
Very disturbing facts here.

[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:15.040]
Says VH1 had a show not too long ago. The all-time number one one hit wonder was the macarena.

[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:18.240]
It's a thank God for those who went into obscurity and those two were.

[01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:19.360]
I don't know.

[01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:20.460]
Most del Rio.

[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:21.260]
Oh yeah.

[01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:27.460]
Flamengo guitar duo from Seville, Spain and Tonyo Romero Mengi and Rafael Ruiz.

[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:28.980]
Pedagones.

[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:35.680]
For our fame duo in the 60s in 1993 they wrote and performed macarena which became a worldwide dance craze

[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:38.580]
and was remixed by the Miami production team of the Bayside Boys.

[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:40.000]
Remixed.

[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:44.720]
So in other words macarena Bayside Boys mix was the hit.

[01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:46.940]
I say keep in mind.

[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:49.060]
Keep in mind, low-stell Rio next time we do this if I make a note.

[01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:49.340]

[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:05.500]

How about Louis-Louis not the song but the group.

[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:21.100]
Did we hear them?

[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:22.380]
The group.

[01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:24.440]

A rock group formed in Spain.

[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:54.920]

[01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:58.900]
My co-girl vocals born in Germany Tony Martinez guitar.

[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:01.120]
Oh by the way I have a song called F the Macarena.

[01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:04.300]
Okay but we'll have to find it somewhere.

[01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:05.940]

[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:17.240]
Los Bravos then put that down too for next to go round.

[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:19.000]
Black is black.

[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:21.240]
Pretty big hit reach number four in 1966.

[01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:23.800]

[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:25.200]
Uh oh.

[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:26.940]
Yeah.

[01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:27.600]
We have a problem.

[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:29.940]
We have a problem captain.

[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:33.400]
Looking glass brandy or a fine girl.

[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:34.340]
Hey to break the news.

[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:35.520]
How does he do this?

[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:35.960]
Can he do it?

[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:36.680]
I guess he can do it.

[01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:38.900]
If he can add ones on he can take ones off right.

[01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:39.480]
Right.

[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:41.760]
Sorry Eric we screwed you up.

[01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:46.280]
Now I got this of a list that somebody facts me and obviously the person who facts me was full of crap

[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:47.800]
which often happens in this crowd.

[01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:49.940]
You know people pretend they know something they know nothing.

[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:54.060]
Brandy was the number one song in 1972 for looking glass.

[01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:59.580]
Pop rock group formed in New Jersey but Jimmy loves Mary Ann made number 33 so they did have another hit.

[01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:04.400]
Not a big gigantic oozing hit but if it made the top 40 it was a hit right.

[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:05.060]

[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:08.700]
So that in charge for three weeks he can put that out of there.

[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:13.320]
Yeah sorry about that because at the moment it started tied for a second right.

[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:16.120]
With 18 votes but there it goes any second now.

[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:17.400]

[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:20.700]
Look through the looking glass one last time see if Alice is still in there.

[01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:23.320]
Sorry we can just give their votes to soft sell.

[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:25.780]
Yeah let's put some more votes on it.

[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:26.600]
They've only got 41.

[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:32.320]
I mean god only knows we want in fact I just might play that till one o'clock just to goose him up some more votes.

[01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:35.900]
Because he need our help.

[01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:43.120]
I was never crazy about this song in the first place before they showed it again but now.

[01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:57.920]
But now.

[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:01.240]
Thank you very much.

[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.480]
Oh here are some very bad news by the way.

[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:09.940]
From the Herald they leaves reject US proposal to beam radio marty signal.

[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:10.440]
Not a shame.

[01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:11.960]
Are you kidding?

[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:16.400]
Belize may be tiny but it knows how to but it knows how to say to Washington.

[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:22.040]
Belize is flatly rejected a US proposal to convert a voice of America relay station to beam US

[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:25.060]
operated radio marty propaganda signal stored Cuba.

[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:28.720]
The denial has this made Cuban American supporters of the radio station.

[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:33.540]
New City Belize facility might have helped a radio marty side step efforts by Cuba to jam its signal.

[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:34.560]
They're jamming it.

[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:39.880]
And by the way special hello to all our listeners in Havana and also where do you think they can hear us in Cuba?

[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:41.140]
Absolutely.

[01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:44.480]
We got a few hits on there when you look in the domain thing on our website.

[01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:45.700]
We get a few not too many.

[01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:48.660]
My family members recall when QAM would play music.

[01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:50.620]
When is the uh let me go?

[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:52.360]
To how would Fidel?

[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:57.920]
But Belize a former British colony in Central America sought to avoid getting ensnared in US Cuba frictions.

[01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:02.060]
It did not want to risk that Havana would retaliate by withdrawing more than 100 doctors and nurses.

[01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:03.520]
It had sent to Belize.

[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:07.280]
We don't want to get involved said Vaughn Gillis spokesperson for the Belize government.

[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:09.840]
Belize has good relations with both Cuba and the US.

[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:11.280]
Good thinking Vaughn.

[01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:16.760]
The US operates two AM radio transmitters near the town of Punda Gorda and the southern most part of Belize.

[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:18.340]
Punda Gorda?

[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:20.840]
Why should we be the only ones?

[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:22.960]
Yeah, some of the we stole fat.

[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:23.400]
We stole fat.

[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:24.680]
We stole that name to have it.

[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:26.500]
There's a two eggs someplace else also.

[01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:32.040]
The transmitters send both English and Spanish voice america's broadcast throughout central America each evening.

[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:34.560]
As a sister facility in the voice of america,

[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:39.100]
Radio Marti was established in 1985 to offer an independent source of news and entertainment to Cubans.

[01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:45.640]
Radio Marti is being toured Cuba on AM from marathon in the Keys and on shoreway from Greenville, North Carolina and Delano, California.

[01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:48.420]
Delano, California?

[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:51.680]
Okay.

[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:53.520]
Okay.

[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:54.480]
I don't get it.

[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:55.480]
Maybe it's by way of China.

[01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:01.000]
In late 2000 US officials began scouring the Caribbean looking for an alternative broadcast site

[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000]
to send the signals of radio marty tour Cuba from a different latitude,

[01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:06.580]
making it more difficult for a cubit of locket signals.

[01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:11.040]
They went to the Turks in Kekos, they went to the Bahamas, and they went to the Cayman said one official

[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:12.280]
insisting on anonymity.

[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:20.140]
Then they noticed the Belize facility and quickly a lot of $750,000 in the 2002 fiscal year budget to enhance the site.

[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:25.120]
An appeal went out to Prime Minister Said Musa of Belize from permission to change the use of the facility.

[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:29.140]
No one seriously expected Belize, an unspoiled nation popular with US scuba divers,

[01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:31.960]
and Mayan archaeology buffs to refuse.

[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:35.660]
But two months ago they did just that, setting tongues wagging around Capitol Hill

[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:38.880]
about how the Bush administration took it on the chin from Belize.

[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:42.040]
Oh, this is even more embarrassing than Las Melvinas, you know what?

[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:46.060]
Belize felt that it had too much to lose since 1999.

[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:50.460]
Belize had hosted an increasing number of Cuban physicians and nurses working in remote villages.

[01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:54.560]
Gild, the government spokesman also noted that more than a 100 Belizean students

[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:57.160]
are in Cuba on full scholarship, some of them studying medicine.

[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:00.780]
As word arrived in Washington, the spring that Belize might turn down the US request,

[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:04.900]
the State Department sent two diplomatic notes to Belmopon, Belize's capital.

[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:08.120]
The second one was apparently sternly worded to the congressional staffer said,

[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:09.600]
and you know what? They still said, no.

[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:10.300]
How do you like that?

[01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:11.140]
All right.

[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:13.460]
Let's hear it for the balls and Belize, baby.

[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:13.920]
Yeah.

[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:15.880]
Just say no to Uncle Sam.

[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:17.560]
Don't let him push you around.

[01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:21.440]
Don't let them make you a pimple like the middleman, like we'd like to do everybody else,

[01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:24.720]
like the forced and coerced them, make him not if they can't refuse to do our bidding.

[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:25.960]
And they just said, no.

[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:26.780]
Good for you.

[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:30.060]
26 past 11 at 5.60.

[01:56:30.140 --> 01:56:31.160]

Is that all they talk about?

[01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:56.980]
Is that all they talk about?

[01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:57.980]
Yeah. I know.

[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:01.160]

[01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:57.580]
I'll save the results and then when we get to the ultimate eventual final one way down the road.

[01:59:57.580 --> 01:59:58.540]
Yeah, we'll take it.

[01:59:58.560 --> 02:00:00.340]
We'll take the top five from each one.

[02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:02.060]
Okay, see what I'm saying.

[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:09.160]
I'm not saying it's soft sell that maybe all of those 42 votes are legitimate, but we have all three eyebrows raised.

[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:14.900]
But anyway, if we're emphatic facts who says bar none, the greatest one hit wonder of all time is.

[02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:17.560]
Did I mention this yesterday when I suggested we might do this poll?

[02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:18.200]
Yes.

[02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:22.020]
96 tiers by question mark and the mysterious from Sagittall Michigan.

[02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:23.700]
Oh, by the way, I thought I mentioned it again.

[02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:27.440]
Well, I'm not going to say it's the best of all time, but certainly and it's doing pretty well.

[02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:29.620]
It's got 13 votes.

[02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:31.280]
It's like in the top 10.

[02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:34.400]
Pretty good choice pal, whoever the hell you are.

[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:35.900]
Whatever you are.

[02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:40.140]
We shall be your kindleware.

[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:48.100]
A North Adams, Massachusetts man, says he told church officials he was molested by the Reverend Richard Levine, years beat that's with a G.

[02:00:48.380 --> 02:00:53.660]
Richard Levine, years before the priest was charged with sexually abusing boys and removed from his duties by the ICC's of spring.

[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:54.300]
Springfield mass.

[02:00:55.420 --> 02:00:58.280]
What are sure a lot of crap going on in mass intuitions, you know what?

[02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:04.300]
Paul Bebo said he had a priest and none in his brother tell the late Bishop Leo O'Neal in 1986.

[02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:06.400]
What? That sounds like the beginning of a joke.

[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:09.600]
A priest and none in his brother.

[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:11.020]
Are you making light of this?

[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:11.340]
Sorry.

[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:14.580]
You better ask the Lord for forgiveness, Mr.

[02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:17.280]
You better start clenching and rosary beads real tight.

[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:18.480]
Domino for biscuits.

[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:24.020]
You better stick another extra wafer in your purse and have a couple extra glasses of wine just to be on the safe side.

[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:32.220]
Paul Bebo said he had a priest and none in his brother tell the late Bishop Leo O'Neal in 1986 that Levine molested him between the ages of 13 and 15.

[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:34.660]
Bebo was 17 at the time he'd be tellin' us.

[02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:42.040]
Stenny, by Bebo at a news conference yesterday the Reverend Eugene Hohn and his sister Eunice Tassoni said they told O'Neal that Bebo reported abuse to them.

[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:47.280]
We were assured Levine would never contact with boys or be left alone with any children after that said by Bebo 33.

[02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:50.820]
A former Berkshire County Commissioner ran unsuccessfully for North Adams Mayor last year.

[02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:56.020]
But from 1986 to was arrest in 1991 we know Levine was abusing and raping other boys.

[02:01:58.260 --> 02:02:02.740]
See, then this whole thing is so sad because these people should have been in jail.

[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:08.280]
It's not an internal question for these glium to decide, well, what should we do? Should we move them over here?

[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:11.060]
Should we restrict his contact with young boys?

[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:15.620]
It should report it to the authorities and put his ass in jail. That's what you should do.

[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:21.260]
That Bebo hasn't yet filed a lawsuit. He said he's speaking up because he thinks it'll help a greenfield man.

[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:24.280]
He says was Levine molested by Levine and is suing the diocese.

[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:30.100]
The man identified in court records only as John Doe says that diocese knew that Levine was abusing children and didn't stop him.

[02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:36.320]
Those lawyers, John Stobersky filed a motion yesterday to get access to impounded records from the criminal prosecution of Levine.

[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:39.860]
Stobersky says these documents will show that the diocese was negligent.

[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:44.500]
In a prepared statement that diocese acknowledged that O'Neill received a report that Levine was molesting a teenager,

[02:02:44.940 --> 02:02:50.140]
after a mental health evaluation of Levine, the diocese determined that the priest could continue his duties this statement said.

[02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:53.700]
Can I read that sentence again?

[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:58.940]
After a mental health evaluation of Levine, the diocese determined that the priest could continue his duties.

[02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:06.360]
Even though he was molesting a minor, the diocese was aware of no further complaints concerning whether Levine was arrested in 1991.

[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:10.900]
The statement said, Levine 61 pleaded guilty in 92 to indecency and suffered fondling to Walter Boyes.

[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:16.700]
He was sentenced to 10 years probation and psychiatric treatment. Church officials banned him from ever serving as a priest in the Springfield diocese.

[02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:24.760]
In 1994, the diocese sent a lawsuit for $1.4 million with 17 alleged victims of Levine, including several from Springfield.

[02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:27.940]
Makes you want a barf.

[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:33.020]
And this whole thing in Dallas starting Thursday, this dog and pony show that they're continuing,

[02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:38.620]
a lot of stupid people out there are going to be convinced, oh look at their really putting their nose to the grinds down now.

[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:39.540]
They're really doing it.

[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:44.600]
All they're doing is trying to cover their ass because this whole scandal is bad for business.

[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:54.800]
Speaking of that, the appeal score justice was considering whether the transcripts of Cardinal Law and Bishop John McCormick's deposition should be released immediately took himself off the case yesterday.

[02:03:56.420 --> 02:04:05.480]
Massachusetts appeal score Justin L. Dorford issued a two-perregraph order, recusing himself after a party whom he did not name, was represented in the case by Palmer and Dodge.

[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:08.440]
Dorford was a partner with the Boston firm from 1981 to 1990.

[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:14.860]
Dorford had given the art style sees a Boston and Loris were plaintiff seeking the public release of the transcripts until noon yesterday to file written arguments.

[02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:18.600]
He's before the case to Chief Justice Christopher Armstrong for a further action.

[02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:22.420]
It was not immediately clear what impact this would have on the release of the documents.

[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:31.920]
Law and McCormick, the law's former aide and out Bishop of New Hampshire, have sat for questioning under oath by Loris for a man who claims, retired priest Paul Shanley repeatedly repudied him as a child.

[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:37.860]
The lawsuit by the family of Gregory Ford claims Law failed to properly oversee priest in the Boston art stasis as we well know.

[02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:44.940]
Shanley became a central figure in the ongoing scandal when Church documents showed he publicly advocated sexual relationships between end and boys.

[02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:55.260]
Middle-sex cows superior court judge Raymond Brasard had ruled transcripts and videotapes of the deposition to be released as soon as they were registered with the court clerk because they were of legitimate public concern.

[02:04:55.260 --> 02:05:01.040]
But the art stasis of P.L. saying it should have 30 days to examine the tapes and transcripts for errors before they made public.

[02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:02.840]
In other words, try to figure out how to cover their ass.

[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:08.880]
The decision would have an impact on when the transcript of the future deposition of Bishop Thomas Daly is made public.

[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:16.760]
Daly was being deposed yesterday in a separate church abuse case bought by alleged victims of the frock priest John Gagan who has been accused of molesting 130 kids in a Boston art stasis.

[02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:19.640]
He was scheduled to be questioned these Shanley case later this week.

[02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:24.200]
Not looking too good you know what for anybody with a brain?

[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:31.180]
Of course I would like to say this anybody with a brain wouldn't still be involved with that organization in the first place or any of this organized religion crap.

[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:33.440]
I just have no patience for it anymore.

[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:38.040]
How long can you be stupid you know? How long can you go through life being professionally stupid?

[02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:49.040]
Oh the good book says this, the good book says that and yeah living in a stone age technologically very advanced and emotionally kind of like Amsterdam you know.

[02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:56.420]
Or they and with them it's the other way around that's right they got it they got it the right way socially advanced technologically they're they're lagging with that.

[02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:06.480]

Authors boys minds.

[02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:48.480]

[02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:42.220]

[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:45.400]
Authors boys minds.

[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:46.720]
Hard in the law.

[02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:48.700]
Authors boys minds.

[02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:55.600]
You know, as soon as I started playing that I thought there we go.

[02:08:55.660 --> 02:08:56.620]
Here's another one hit wonder.

[02:08:57.580 --> 02:08:58.280]
Guess what?

[02:08:59.400 --> 02:08:59.780]
Wrong.

[02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:00.460]
I looked it up.

[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:02.320]
Good thing I got this book, you know, the billboard book.

[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:02.880]
Yep.

[02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:09.320]
Bobby Fuller IV I fought the law reached number nine in 1966 but loves made a fool of you

[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:15.080]
1966 may have 66 written in 1958 by Buddy Holly by the way before he died.

[02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:19.020]
Well, he could have written it after he died and like sent it from heaven.

[02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:20.040]
He's up there looking down.

[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:21.580]
Why do people say stuff like that?

[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:22.140]
They're weak.

[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:26.300]
Oh, they're look, they're up there watching the game right now like they had Larry McCarty on

[02:09:26.300 --> 02:09:27.200]
it right off in the red wings.

[02:09:30.220 --> 02:09:34.540]
And he's talking about his father who died from cancer, you know, and his grandfather

[02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:36.040]
and this was uncle and they're all dead.

[02:09:36.340 --> 02:09:38.520]
Well, I'm sure they're up there watching the game up upstairs.

[02:09:38.740 --> 02:09:39.320]
They're watching down.

[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:41.280]
You know, why do people talk such crap?

[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:45.240]
It's the same reason that people are still involved in all these goddamn religions.

[02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:47.260]
It's the same reason they go to Miss Cleo.

[02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:51.760]
It's the same reason that every time you have a psychic or a goddamn fortune teller on

[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:53.660]
here, the phones are just about blow out.

[02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:57.080]
People are desperate to be conned.

[02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:59.100]
That's why that Miss Cleo thing is a shame.

[02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:04.600]
All these religious fakers are on there with the goddamn toll free numbers at the bottom of the screen

[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:07.380]
so they can rip off your money, take your credit card.

[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:11.000]
God, I'm sorry.

[02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:11.880]
Oh, God.

[02:10:13.380 --> 02:10:15.540]
When are people finally going to wise up?

[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:16.420]
Is it ever going to happen?

[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:17.400]
Oh, I don't think so.

[02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:19.400]
Yeah, but that John Edward guy, he's for real.

[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:20.720]
Yeah, there's another one.

[02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:25.420]
And the stupid women who watch that crap, they can't get enough of it.

[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:27.680]
I'm not so sure who's Dumber.

[02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:32.940]
The people who watch that or the people who watch Oprah or the people who believe in fairy tales like Jesus Christ.

[02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:33.600]
Things like that.

[02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:34.960]
I think they're all the same people.

[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:36.280]
Yeah, probably right.

[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:39.920]
Body fuller for loves made a fool of you reach number 26.

[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:42.460]
So sorry, but nice try.

[02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:45.460]
Now what's going on with our poll or something strange going on here, Eric?

[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:49.040]
I don't want to start picking on Eric, but this thing's been stuck on the same number of votes.

[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:51.920]
Yeah, it stuck at 276 for like the last 10 minutes.

[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:54.820]
Since he took off brandy, there's something that was are going on.

[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:57.380]
Don't tell me there's nobody else voting on this.

[02:10:57.700 --> 02:11:02.860]
Which of these one hit wonders was bet soft sell tainted love 42 votes, which were very dubious about.

[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:04.640]
It could be number one though, you know?

[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:06.320]
Okay.

[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:09.380]
I said it could be.

[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:11.500]
It might miss a C.B. Queen 20.

[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:13.820]
Norman Greenbaum, Spirit of the Sky 18.

[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:17.600]
Steam, Nanai, Hey, Hey Kissing, Goodbye, Andy M.F. Unbelievable 15.

[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:20.340]
Zagrin Evans in the year 25, 25, 14.

[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:23.600]
Question Mark and Mathurians, 90 thick fear at that 13.

[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:28.860]
Blue's image, Rod Captain Ride, Taco putting on the Ritz and Paper Lace Nightshake, I would have had you to have 12.

[02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:30.440]
After that, it's pretty far downhill.

[02:11:31.180 --> 02:11:33.520]
Although Johnson Bastion, Mark of that Carter's got eight.

[02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:41.340]
And you know something? White planes, my baby loves love and we change the name of that three times and still has no votes.

[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:43.600]
Oh, that's changing again. Maybe that'll help.

[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:45.420]
Yeah, let's make up another name for it.

[02:11:45.420 --> 02:11:46.880]
Let's say it's by the Beatles.

[02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:49.360]
I'm not buying those taco results either by the way.

[02:11:49.860 --> 02:11:50.420]
Why not?

[02:11:51.100 --> 02:11:52.200]
Because that's another crock.

[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:54.040]
I can't imagine anybody actually liking that.

[02:11:54.100 --> 02:12:00.460]
See, this is the problem when we take a pool that's objective like this and you don't want to accept the, you know, the fact that a lot of people out there have got bad taste.

[02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:10.060]
I mean, Norman Greenbaum in Spirit of the Sky, if that's in the same league with a lot of the other stuff like incense and peppermints by the strawberry alarm clock or Harsher Buy the Mystics,

[02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:12.040]
which still has got only six votes.

[02:12:13.060 --> 02:12:17.660]
Our Dean Taylor, Indiana wants me still stuck down here with three, with three freaking votes.

[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:20.240]
And let's see if this thing changed on there.

[02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:21.840]
How many votes does it say on your screen?

[02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:22.940]
276.

[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:24.640]
Yeah, it has just been loaded manually too.

[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:26.760]
It's been stuck on there for like 10 minutes, Eric.

[02:12:26.860 --> 02:12:28.500]
And I know that there are other people voting on this thing.

[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:29.180]
Gotta be.

[02:12:30.140 --> 02:12:32.740]
Something's very strange with our pool, okay?

[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:34.440]
We got a strange pool today.

[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:43.100]
1148 at 560 WQM Supreme Court shoots down gun appeals testing individual rights throwing firearms, bad news.

[02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:47.340]
But what do you expect from those fascists on the bench anyway, huh?

[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:49.220]
The same people that gave you George W.

[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:50.100]
Oh, sorry, Robert.

[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:52.840]
What's on with the pool?

[02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:52.980]
Yeah.

[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:54.680]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:56.380]
Never met a fascist he didn't like.

[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:59.380]
Maybe he knows some of the people in Sicilya, Scalilla.

[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:09.300]
The Supreme Court said Monday, well, not here two cases that would have offered a test of the Bush administration's newly articulated position, that the Constitution protects an individual's right to own guns.

[02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:13.540]
Without comment, the court turned down two men convicted of violating federal gun laws.

[02:13:14.020 --> 02:13:19.500]
The men had argued that the laws are unconstitutional because the Second Amendment gives Americans the right to keep and bear arms.

[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:26.500]
The cases marked the first time that the Bush administration had told a Supreme Court that has reversed a decades old policy on the Second Amendment.

[02:13:27.060 --> 02:13:33.260]
Until now, the government has said the amendment protects a collective, not an individual, right to gun ownership, and the NRA is proud, baby.

[02:13:33.460 --> 02:13:34.020]
They love it.

[02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:34.960]
They're thrilled.

[02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:37.680]
They got their hands in both of George's pockets.

[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:42.280]
The distinction is important because gun laws necessarily restrict individual rights.

[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:48.820]
The administration also said its new position is not undermined federal gun laws because the Second Amendment right is still subject to reasonable restrictions.

[02:13:49.480 --> 02:14:02.420]
Using that rationale, the administration urged the High Court not to accept the appeals of Timothy, Joe Emerson, and John Lee Henley, both were properly convicted of violating laws the administration considers reasonable limitations of the gun rights solicitor general Ted Olson said.

[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:05.680]
The Second Amendment reads a well-regulated, well-we know what it says.

[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:11.080]
The Supreme Court interpreted that in 1939 as a protection of militia rights not of individual ones.

[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:16.960]
Decades of just a tabaran policy arrested on that which preceded most federal laws regulating who may own what type of gun.

[02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:32.060]
The current position of the United States is that the Second Amendment more broadly protects the rights of individuals, including persons who are not members of any militia, or engaged in active military service or training to possess and bear their own firearms, Olson wrote in footnotes, attached to the filings in the Emerson and Henley cases.

[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:41.780]
That right, however, is subject to reasonable restrictions designed to prevent possession by unfit persons, or to restrict the possession of types of firearms that are particularly suited to criminal misuse Olson wrote last month.

[02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:51.160]
Olson, the administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, was reflecting a view that Attorney General John Ascroft had voiced last year in a letter to the National Rifle Association.

[02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:57.800]
The text and the original intent of the Second Amendment clearly protected the right of individual individuals to keep in bear arms Ascroft wrote then.

[02:14:58.700 --> 02:15:04.380]
At the time Ascroft wrote the letter was unclear whether it was expressing his personal view, or stating a new policy position for the government.

[02:15:04.820 --> 02:15:16.820]
That question was mostly answered last November when he sent letter to federal prosecutors, praising an appeal score to citizens that found the Second Amendment does protect individual rights, but noting that those rights could be subjected to limited nearly tailored specific exceptions.

[02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:28.540]
That opinion by the 50 West Circuit Court of Appeals went on to reject arguments from Emerson and Texas Physician that in 1994, Federal Gun Law was unconstitutional, the law was intended to deny guns to people under judicial restraining orders.

[02:15:28.540 --> 02:15:37.940]
In my view of the Emerson opinion and the balance that strikes, generally reflect the correct understanding of the Second Amendment Ascroft told prosecutors, the appeals put the Justice Department in an awkward position.

[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:45.900]
Although the government won both cases in lower courts using the old interpretation of the Second Amendment, Ascroft had switched gears by the time the appeals reached the high court.

[02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:49.020]
Well, they better check with the NRA and make sure it's AOK.

[02:15:49.620 --> 02:15:51.300]
OK? Like those things would say?

[02:15:51.540 --> 02:15:51.820]
OK.

[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:52.320]
OK.

[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:54.740]
Now, how does that think of it as it's still stuck?

[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:56.960]
I'm reloading.

[02:15:57.500 --> 02:15:58.520]
Oh, it finally moved.

[02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:01.340]
So, yeah, there was something stuck on there.

[02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:04.340]
Stuck in the middle with you.

[02:16:04.940 --> 02:16:05.400]
Steelers wheel.

[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:06.340]
Yeah. Great.

[02:16:06.460 --> 02:16:08.160]
Did we say that that qualifies?

[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:09.800]
You have to look that up.

[02:16:10.140 --> 02:16:11.780]
Let's feel you hit that I know of, of theirs.

[02:16:12.660 --> 02:16:13.660]
Well, I have to put that on.

[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:16.000]
The next time we do this, which I think will be a long ways down there.

[02:16:16.220 --> 02:16:16.620]
I don't know.

[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:17.180]
How do I know?

[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:20.780]
I'm throwing away, uh, faxes of things that we already know about.

[02:16:21.340 --> 02:16:22.900]
People's suggestions that we already know about.

[02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:23.380]
They're already different.

[02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:24.980]
So, now that we're getting your response on this?

[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:26.020]
Yeah, a little bit.

[02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:28.820]
Or that they don't qualify like BJ Thomas.

[02:16:28.820 --> 02:16:29.920]
I'm sure had more than one.

[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.060]
BJ Thomas, are you people crazy?

[02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:34.760]
BJ Thomas had a crap load of hits.

[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:37.060]
Hooked on a feeling.

[02:16:37.980 --> 02:16:38.700]
Rock and roll low.

[02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:39.120]
Oh, by.

[02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:42.160]
Ah, brain drops keep falling.

[02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:43.160]
That's the only thing that's the only thing that's the only thing.

[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:43.980]
Brain drops keep falling on my thing.

[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:45.760]
He had a Schmidt load of hits.

[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:46.660]
BJ Thomas.

[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:48.060]
Steelers wheel had star.

[02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:48.840]
Sorry.

[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:51.980]
Stuck in the middle with you and star.

[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:52.720]
Don't you remember star?

[02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:52.980]
No.

[02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:53.840]
Why do?

[02:16:54.180 --> 02:16:56.200]
I don't know how it goes, but I remember it vaguely.

[02:16:57.140 --> 02:16:59.680]
Just to show you, who faxed that?

[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:01.020]
That doesn't have a name.

[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:04.280]
I want to trace that fax and get that person and just knock a little sound.

[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:05.400]
God, they were the two by four.

[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:05.980]
Hey, Scott.

[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:06.280]

[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:07.460]
Get one that's Scott.

[02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:09.220]
You're probably a pretty good guy, Scott.

[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:09.860]
Send some pictures.

[02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:11.000]
But Jesus Christ.

[02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:14.280]
God is that fast, my ass, when we get something stupid like that.

[02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:14.920]
Jesus Christ.

[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:17.060]
I'm so low to my good cry.

[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:19.040]
Mama, Billy and Sue.

[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:20.500]
The eyes of a New York woman.

[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:21.340]
Hooked on a feeling.

[02:17:21.340 --> 02:17:23.920]
Rain drops keep falling on my head, which is number one for four weeks.

[02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:24.940]
Everybody's out of town.

[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:25.880]
I just can't help believing.

[02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:27.960]
Most of all, no love at all.

[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:31.180]
Mighty clouds of joy, which wasn't a big hit, but probably the best record you ever made.

[02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:31.580]
You remember that?

[02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:32.260]
Yes.

[02:17:33.380 --> 02:17:36.520]
Rock and roll Lullaby, which in for my money is the second best song you ever did.

[02:17:37.380 --> 02:17:39.560]
Hey, won't you play another somebody done somebody wrong song?

[02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:40.120]
Of course.

[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:41.420]
Which also reach number one.

[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:42.580]
And don't worry, baby.

[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:44.140]
A remake of the Beach Bull.

[02:17:44.180 --> 02:17:44.540]
Oh, I had to play that.

[02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:45.820]
I'm going to tell you something, folks.

[02:17:46.140 --> 02:17:50.620]
BJ Thomas, who was raised in Rosenberg, Texas, all the way is not Jewish.

[02:17:51.180 --> 02:17:51.900]
Is great.

[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:54.120]
One of the greatest voices in the history of rock and roll.

[02:17:54.300 --> 02:17:55.300]
Is there any question about that?

[02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:56.220]
And the question again, Christian, now you know.

[02:17:56.380 --> 02:17:57.440]
I don't care about that.

[02:17:57.640 --> 02:17:59.300]
He can believe whatever he tells he wants.

[02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:00.480]
No, he has a great voice.

[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:00.840]
I agree.

[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:01.360]
But he's a...

[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:02.680]
BJ Thomas is great.

[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:07.340]
And he probably had to become a born again Christian because all those people can't imagine what the BJ stands for.

[02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:09.900]
But he's...

[02:18:09.900 --> 02:18:11.740]
God, I mean, Scott, get serious.

[02:18:13.140 --> 02:18:15.140]
Although you know something, these books are pretty damn expensive.

[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:19.880]
I mean, that's the only way you're really going to know all the BJ Thomas you shouldn't own, Scott.

[02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:26.660]
Well, you just first have my experience about BJ Thomas's every time he's go to the record store and you see BJ Thomas's greatest hits all over the place.

[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:29.020]
In the display rack.

[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:32.040]
Yeah, there are not too many CDs out there with so-and-so's greatest hit.

[02:18:33.980 --> 02:18:35.960]
Oh, here's Lauren, who's also a chronic factor.

[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:38.080]
She says, I don't know if it's on a current list of one.

[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:39.840]
It wonders and nominate the next time.

[02:18:40.220 --> 02:18:41.680]
The boys are back in town by Tin Lazy.

[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:42.380]
That's a good one.

[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:43.880]
Yeah, Tin Lazy.

[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:45.600]
Did I say Tin Lazy?

[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:48.100]
You just says Tin Lazy or Tin Lazy, whatever the real name is.

[02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:51.600]
My favorite line in the song is if that chick don't want to know, forget her.

[02:18:51.900 --> 02:18:52.620]
Well, that's good.

[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:54.500]
The boys are back in town.

[02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:56.980]
They play that a lot at the Ahaki Games here in Toronto.

[02:18:58.440 --> 02:18:59.420]
Don't ask me why.

[02:19:00.020 --> 02:19:02.200]
Well, it's better than that stupid stop in titles.

[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:03.560]
I don't think they're one hit wonder.

[02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:05.320]
They're not.

[02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:06.840]
Tin Lazy, they had jailbreak.

[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:08.400]
Ah, Jesus.

[02:19:08.580 --> 02:19:08.940]
That's a very good...

[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:09.440]
There we go.

[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:12.880]
You know, this book weighs about 400 pounds.

[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:13.900]
I hate to break the news to you.

[02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:17.180]
This is a heavy-duty book that costs $38.95 Canadian A,

[02:19:17.180 --> 02:19:18.580]
which is about $25 US.

[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:21.060]
This is the top 40 billboard book.

[02:19:21.300 --> 02:19:22.280]
Now, what is it I'm looking for?

[02:19:22.460 --> 02:19:22.840]
Tin Lazy.

[02:19:23.060 --> 02:19:24.120]
Oh, 38 Spacals.

[02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:28.160]
There's jailbreak.

[02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:31.940]
Well, guess what?

[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:32.740]
Didn't make the charts.

[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:33.400]
Uh-oh.

[02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:38.820]
He gave us that big dramatic thing there and you're wrong.

[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:39.280]
What's funny?

[02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:40.740]
The Bokobrine emailed me that one.

[02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:41.380]
But not that one.

[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:42.080]
The Bokobrine's book.

[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:42.500]
The Crab.

[02:19:42.660 --> 02:19:46.600]
The boys are back in town, reached number 12 in 1976.

[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:49.020]
Rock Group from Dublin, Ireland, Tin Lazy.

[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:53.720]
Phil Lennart, Focals and Bass, Brian Robertson, and Scott Gorham, the guitars,

[02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:58.080]
and Brian Downey on the drums law died in 86 at the age of only 34.

[02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:00.800]
And we're not going to speculate as to why.

[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:03.340]
So, I do like that, huh?

[02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:04.160]
Mr. Houchot.

[02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:04.880]
There were one.

[02:20:04.980 --> 02:20:05.960]
So, might make an order that.

[02:20:06.280 --> 02:20:06.440]
Okay.

[02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:09.420]
Can I get to this one quick thing before we do the break?

[02:20:09.780 --> 02:20:13.220]
Moroccan Police have dismantled a terrorist cell with links to Osama Yomamabin-Laden-Zelkite

[02:20:13.220 --> 02:20:14.920]
and Eberk, arresting three Saudi nationals.

[02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:16.580]
He government officials said yesterday.

[02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:20.740]
The three men were planning suicide operations against the American and British warships,

[02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:24.100]
patrolling the straight edge of your border, the Moroccan officials said on condition of anonymity.

[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:26.680]
The names of the suspects who arrested and may were not released.

[02:20:27.460 --> 02:20:30.560]
The arrest were made with the help of intelligent services of several friendly countries,

[02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:31.820]
one of the officials told the AP.

[02:20:32.260 --> 02:20:36.100]
It's the first confirmation of a crackdown in Morocco since the US and its allies launched

[02:20:36.100 --> 02:20:38.460]
the military campaign in Afghanistan to destroy Al Qaeda.

[02:20:38.820 --> 02:20:42.940]
In October 2002, suicide bombers in a small dinghy, rammed the USS Coldest Dwarren

[02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:46.240]
and a port in Yemen blasting a hole on its side as we know killing 17 sailors.

[02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:49.640]
Okay, there you go.

[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:52.940]
Oh, it also says in the last sentence, I guess I shouldn't throw it on.

[02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:56.640]
If Al Qaeda operatives are confirmed to be behind the attack with Mark III's terrorist groups,

[02:20:56.820 --> 02:21:00.620]
first known successful operation outside the war zone in Central Asia since 9-11.

[02:21:01.180 --> 02:21:02.480]
We just mentioned that in passing.

[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:06.800]
So, Thin Lizzy qualifies, make sure we keep that on the list,

[02:21:06.900 --> 02:21:08.460]
along with Tepau and all of us.

[02:21:08.700 --> 02:21:10.700]
And BJ Tom is, I'm distraught.

[02:21:10.700 --> 02:21:13.980]
And you know what I'm going to do, I'm going to go out and buy me a BJ Tom of CD today.

[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:14.780]
All right.

[02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:17.240]
Just to show Scott a thing or two, okay about music.

[02:21:17.940 --> 02:21:20.620]
11.50 C.M.I.D. clouds of joy was just, oh, great.

[02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:22.780]
Just phenomenal. I got to hear it right now.

[02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:27.360]
Three minutes till noon at 5.60 WQM, if your carpets look and smell like crap.

[02:21:28.220 --> 02:21:31.200]
Well, you know, we can ring our hands and wish about what slabs we are.

[02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:35.820]
But the fact of the matter is, all the Aghest, all the company, all the pets walk in and back and forth,

[02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:38.420]
smirring all of that schmutz into the fibers of the carpet.

[02:21:38.420 --> 02:21:42.240]
Right now, it's springtime again, which means time for good spring cleaning for your carpets too,

[02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:43.920]
from our good friends of dry concepts.

[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:45.640]
Nobody in the universe does it like them.

[02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:48.140]
That's why I use it in my house for over 20 years now.

[02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:52.540]
They take all the panic and the nervousness out of having your carpets clean because you know ahead of time,

[02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:54.880]
they give you a written guaranteed price before they start the job.

[02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:57.920]
And by the time they get finished, your carpets look and smell just like brand new.

[02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:00.680]
They're drying a couple of hours and you're going to have the biggest smile on your push.

[02:22:00.980 --> 02:22:02.260]
You've had in a hell of a long time.

[02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:06.380]
So don't be fooled by those 5.99 scam specialists that leave your carpets so for two days.

[02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:08.180]
And so I'm going to let you end of the job.

[02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:11.080]
Treat yourself and your carpets to a real great spring cleaning today.

[02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:16.440]
In Broward County, called dry concepts of this number, 954-370-7778.

[02:22:27.140 --> 02:22:27.940]

[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:30.280]
Agent.

[02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:32.040]
Stand in Kaplan.

[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:36.080]
Meet nights in 10 on sports radio 516-QAM.

[02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:37.920]
Ah, the Steve Goldstein.

[02:22:38.180 --> 02:22:39.120]
But you can call me Kelsey.

[02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:41.040]
Whenever I'm in town, I listen to...

[02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:42.240]
Wait a minute, I am in town.

[02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:44.040]
It's the 12th of one hour.

[02:22:44.440 --> 02:22:44.600]
That!

[02:22:45.100 --> 02:22:48.080]
Father's Day should be spent with that special man in your life.

[02:22:48.220 --> 02:22:49.900]
And for the golf course, see you later.

[02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:51.620]
A lot later.

[02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:54.540]
But what if that isn't around on Father's Day?

[02:22:55.180 --> 02:22:56.500]
That's when you need to call?

[02:22:56.500 --> 02:22:57.500]
Redded Add.

[02:22:58.220 --> 02:23:06.420]
Father's Day with your Redded Add starts early, as he shows up unannounced at 630 to run his lawnmower right under your bedroom window.

[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:09.360]
What the...

[02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:10.540]
What the...

[02:23:10.540 --> 02:23:10.760]
Wake up!

[02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:19.180]
And when your Redded Add comes inside, he'll have straight for his favorite seat in the house to spend 25 minutes doing what every dad loves to do.

[02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:20.540]
Damn it, we're just a plunger!

[02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:24.560]
And spending a day with Redded Add is just like spending it with your real dad.

[02:23:24.860 --> 02:23:25.840]
Get me a beer!

[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:27.980]
Here you go, Uncle Dad.

[02:23:28.420 --> 02:23:31.000]
Now what took you so long, you'll never have gotten tough at this.

[02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:32.920]
I love you, Uncle Dad.

[02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:34.040]
Yeah, you know.

[02:23:34.300 --> 02:23:36.320]
Now get your head out of the way you're walking the screen!

[02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:42.140]
Make this Father's Day one that's just like every other Father's Day you've ever had with Redded Add.

[02:23:42.940 --> 02:23:44.780]
You know something, maybe that's what I should have had.

[02:23:45.680 --> 02:23:48.180]
Come on one at 560, WQM, it's a big new one.

[02:23:48.300 --> 02:23:51.000]
Now we've got the Mad Dog Gym Manusus back today between the one and three.

[02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:52.680]
We got Hank in studio three o'clock.

[02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:56.540]
You know I heard somebody yesterday talking to Hank about the Belmont.

[02:23:57.720 --> 02:24:02.900]
Or no, Hank was talking about Andy Byer who of course is considered the greatest Thirbert handicap in all of the country.

[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:05.160]
And they have the buyer ratings, the speed ratings etc.

[02:24:05.420 --> 02:24:07.820]
And so on, he's written many books on Thirbert raising and handicrapping.

[02:24:08.660 --> 02:24:17.420]
But for Andy Byer or anybody to question that War Amblem lost all chance to win when he stumbled out of the gate and nearly fell down on his ass right on his nose.

[02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:21.400]
I've been getting to wonder if Andy Byer ain't doing like magic mushrooms or something like that.

[02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:24.820]
Just like the Humphrey said once that, that was it, that was the end.

[02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:28.300]
Anybody who knows even just a teeny tiny little bit about horse racing.

[02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:29.020]
But anyway.

[02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:33.960]
So this Faxor who was doing about Tin Lazy and Tin Lazy and the boys are back in the glamour back in town.

[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:37.860]
It says to Powell, head Vulcan female ruler on Star Trek.

[02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:44.020]
She made Spock Fight Kirk to the death when Spock needed to get laid or risk dying from green balls on his home planet.

[02:24:44.620 --> 02:24:46.240]
I don't know if you could die from green balls.

[02:24:47.180 --> 02:24:48.820]
Oh, if you haven't really died.

[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:50.920]
Spock's, how about Blue Balls?

[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:53.660]
Spock's woman had eyes for Kirk and this fight would determine who would get her.

[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:58.560]
Bones dragged Kirk so he'd appear to die during battle later on when he's Spock saw Kirk was alive on the Enterprise.

[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:01.020]
He smiled for the only time ever on the show.

[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:01.860]
How do you like that?

[02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:03.740]
I'll start direct trivia for you.

[02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:05.900]
God is that boring stuff, you know?

[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:06.300]
Yeah.

[02:25:06.340 --> 02:25:08.160]
Like Bill Shattonor said, get a life.

[02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:09.480]
But thanks for the great facts.

[02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:12.940]
Paul says, you know what Americans want?

[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:14.460]
What do Americans want?

[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:15.360]
Not money.

[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:16.900]
Not getting laid.

[02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:20.400]
Four and five Americans would give up some freedoms to gain security.

[02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:21.280]
That's what they want.

[02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:21.800]
Security.

[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:22.960]
They want to be safe.

[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:26.840]
Maybe we can all get together and eat it loose and the Bronx will be safe.

[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:31.540]
And four and ten worry terrorists will harm them or their family in New Gala poll shows.

[02:25:32.260 --> 02:25:34.020]
Four and ten worry the terrorists.

[02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:36.840]
See, this is the new deal now since they got caught with their pants down.

[02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:38.720]
Since all the whistleblowers came out of the closet.

[02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:42.800]
We got scuba divers are going to get us.

[02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:47.260]
And we got the dirty bomb and the clean bomb and the neutron bomb and the big bomb.

[02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:47.900]
Yeah.

[02:25:48.380 --> 02:25:49.480]
Can everybody know a panic?

[02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:54.500]
And then of course we got those brilliant statements from people like Robert Mueller who keeps saying,

[02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:57.460]
well, it's not a question of if it's just a question of one and there will be another attack.

[02:25:57.560 --> 02:25:58.520]
And it will be a nuclear attack.

[02:25:58.760 --> 02:25:59.580]
It could be in ten minutes.

[02:25:59.580 --> 02:26:00.380]
It could be in ten years.

[02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:01.440]
It could be in a hundred years.

[02:26:01.620 --> 02:26:03.480]
Well, I mean, talk about covering your ass.

[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:07.320]
This guy's even covered his ass for like long before he's pushing up daisies.

[02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:10.020]
Is that incredible or what?

[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:11.300]
It's very credible.

[02:26:13.860 --> 02:26:18.840]
About a third of those poll favor making it easier for authorities to access private email and telephone conversations.

[02:26:18.900 --> 02:26:23.540]
More than 70% are now in favor of requiring U.S. citizens to carry ID cards with fingerprints.

[02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:26.900]
And 77% believe all Americans should have smallpox vaccinations.

[02:26:27.260 --> 02:26:32.580]
I hate to break the news to you though, but if you go on the internet and find out that there's some very bad side effects from the current smallpox vaccine.

[02:26:32.580 --> 02:26:36.640]
I just mentioned that before you get whipped up into a frenzy.

[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:40.200]
What a bunch of goose steppers the public is, you know.

[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:45.620]
It was amazing the percentage of people who were willing to give up freedom to get back some sense of personal security,

[02:26:45.980 --> 02:26:48.880]
steady lane Christians and senior research director for the Gallup organization.

[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:53.120]
These aren't people who were necessarily near the twin towers, near the Pentagon, near the Maraud building.

[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:54.280]
These are just average people.

[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:59.580]
The telephone survey conducted in March included 934...

[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:02.420]
To compare results with the general population survey.

[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:10.120]
The poll showed 8% of Americans are very worried and 31% are somewhat worried that they or someone in their family would become victims of a terrorist attack in the U.S.

[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:12.140]
In New York City the level of worry is higher.

[02:27:12.260 --> 02:27:15.860]
19% said they're very worried and 34% said there's their somewhat worried.

[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:19.620]
Washington DC and Oklahoma City reported levels of fear close to national average.

[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:24.360]
Scientists involved in the poll said they were not surprised many Americans remained fearful after September 11th.

[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:29.500]
The magnitude of the event was just so profound that Carol Northay, South Ketrick professor at Washington University in St. Louis,

[02:27:29.780 --> 02:27:34.740]
who said talking to the war in Afghanistan, airline security and terrorist threats is propelling the fear.

[02:27:34.900 --> 02:27:36.060]
And you know who's doing the propelling?

[02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:37.120]
I give up.

[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:38.820]
The media?

[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:40.260]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:27:40.620 --> 02:27:41.080]
The media?

[02:27:41.420 --> 02:27:42.920]
Just thick and they talk bad.

[02:27:42.980 --> 02:27:45.380]
Yeah, I was going to give you like a little clue there from good old Tammy Faye.

[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:47.560]
And I hope Carlos has a wonderful life with Tammy Faye.

[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:48.680]
I hope they all love together.

[02:27:49.540 --> 02:27:51.460]
Birds of a feather on and speaking of that.

[02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:54.340]
This next story from the Boston hero.

[02:27:57.780 --> 02:27:59.860]
Save Boy's life since parents died food.

[02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:01.240]
Say it again.

[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:03.360]
Cult and aunt.

[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:04.260]
Okay.

[02:28:04.340 --> 02:28:06.320]
And when you look at that you see all the letters are written there.

[02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:06.960]
You see what I'm saying?

[02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:07.320]
Yeah.

[02:28:09.020 --> 02:28:09.380]
C'mon.

[02:28:10.820 --> 02:28:12.180]
Say that for your show.

[02:28:12.300 --> 02:28:17.380]
Okay, we're not going to do gratuitous filth on this show because of the fact that you know you're just a pervert.

[02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:18.460]
We're not going to do that.

[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:20.120]
What was it?

[02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:27.960]
Content massed in eternal ant of a baby boy who started that because of her religious parents will not feed him solid food.

[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:31.540]
Testified yesterday that she pleaded with a child's father resumed feeding him.

[02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:32.400]
Remember this story?

[02:28:32.860 --> 02:28:33.080]
Uh-huh.

[02:28:33.620 --> 02:28:35.500]
Only days ago it made me sick.

[02:28:35.980 --> 02:28:37.040]
Well, I'm like even sicker.

[02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:42.820]
Renee Horton said her brother-in-law, Jacques Robodo, defended the decision to feed a baby exclusively from his mother's breast by saying,

[02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:44.280]
this is from God.

[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:46.460]
This is what we have to do and we have to have faith.

[02:28:46.700 --> 02:28:48.900]
Like I told you, the religious people are the crazy people.

[02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:50.120]
Like that.

[02:28:52.500 --> 02:29:01.380]
I've carried was pregnant unable to produce milk for her son and Jacques Robodo 29 is on trial for first degree murder for letting the 11th month old boy starve over two month period.

[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:08.360]
Samuel Robodo and another second child who was still born eventually were on earth from a makeshift grave in Back to State Park in Maine.

[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:11.740]
Karen Robodo faces a second of a murder charge in upcoming trial.

[02:29:12.140 --> 02:29:14.920]
In April 99 after Samuel had become so weak he could barely move.

[02:29:15.300 --> 02:29:18.360]
His mother called a prayer meeting of the separatist religious sect based in Seaconc.

[02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:22.060]
Karen wanted to pray for Samuel as a group persistent.

[02:29:22.240 --> 02:29:25.100]
And they also remember the sect testified in Bristol Superior Court.

[02:29:25.860 --> 02:29:34.480]
The morning after the prayer session, Jacques Robodo announced to the group that Samuel is sleeping with God according to the testimony of Renee Horton's husband, Daniel, who was also member of the sect.

[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:36.780]
About a month earlier, Daniel Horton testified.

[02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:41.760]
Jacques Robodo had heard a radio news report about a New York woman whose baby died while eating nothing but breast milk.

[02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:44.860]
Horton said Robodo considered the news report intent by Satan.

[02:29:47.860 --> 02:29:48.740]
Force sterilization.

[02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:51.800]
I know that Samuel was not going to die.

[02:29:51.960 --> 02:29:53.740]
Horton said Jacques Robodo told him at the time.

[02:29:53.940 --> 02:29:54.520]
Well, guess what?

[02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:56.600]
Wrong.

[02:29:57.320 --> 02:30:07.680]
As he ascents the trial began a week ago, defense attorney Francis O'Boy crossed exam with the witnesses to emphasize his contention that his client was being manipulated by sect founder Roland Robodo Jacques's father.

[02:30:08.500 --> 02:30:15.020]
The other Robodo ostracized the group members almost all of whom were his own extended family if they ignored the teachings or leadings from God according to witnesses.

[02:30:16.100 --> 02:30:17.140]
Like that crazy.

[02:30:17.660 --> 02:30:24.540]
In this case, Jacques Robodo's sister Michelle Mingo had claimed that God told her in late February of 99 that Samuel should take nourishment only from his mother.

[02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:32.280]
When Karen Robodo initially bought the changing her healthy son's diet, Jacques told her if someone has a leading, we have to take it as if the apostle Paul had said it.

[02:30:32.740 --> 02:30:34.440]
And we have to...

[02:30:36.820 --> 02:30:37.840]
Yeah, that's why.

[02:30:38.100 --> 02:30:41.120]
Because he's just playing stupid, like all the religious nuts.

[02:30:41.700 --> 02:30:49.660]
Shortly after the death Daniel Horton and his wife and children left the sect, although they clearly felt that what had happened to Samuel was wrong, the Horton still were told by the decision to leave the group.

[02:30:50.140 --> 02:30:55.880]
Roland considered the group to be God's camphorton said the attitude of the group was if you left your leaving God.

[02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:57.480]
How do you like that, huh?

[02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:03.440]
Like I said, the religious people are the crazy people speaking of the Horton's, by the way, from days of our lives.

[02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:04.800]
Yeah.

[02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:17.400]
All you guiding light people are two of you that we have left in the audience. You know great, we got the not the original Ed Bar, but the last Ed Bar, finally came back from Africa and Mindy and Wusty and all the other goyem came back for the big Riva and Riva and what's his name?

[02:31:18.060 --> 02:31:19.220]
Josh's 85th time they got married.

[02:31:20.840 --> 02:31:27.600]
But there's trouble in paradise. I'll tell you that right now because at the end of the show yesterday, all of you is up to World Tricks and the lights go out.

[02:31:30.040 --> 02:31:32.900]
Didn't pretty heavy duty and now and now here's a.

[02:31:35.580 --> 02:31:43.920]
A big deal with the multi billionaire who now of course is in hell or somewhere, but he's running around with like a little nap sack on his back along with Timmy and his nap sack and little total.

[02:31:44.300 --> 02:31:46.800]
How come total don't have a nap sack? God damn it.

[02:31:47.860 --> 02:31:55.040]
Speaking of depressing stories, Griffin, Joja, a Georgia woman's accused of fatally shooting her two middle-aged son, Saturday night at a small town nursing home.

[02:31:56.080 --> 02:32:09.320]
Carol Carr, 63 who faces double murder charges, was a frequent visitor to Sunbridge, Karen rehab center and Griffin, where son's Michael Randy Scott 42, an Andy Byron Scott 41, lived for the past four months, Griffin, Pulley, Sergeant James Landham said.

[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:17.900]
Both suffered from an undisclosed long-term degenerative disease, Landham said, Carr of nearby Hampton shot them in with a small caliber handgun, shortly after 9 p.m. Landham said.

[02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:23.240]
Arrested by the officer responding to the call, the mother said she shot her son because she didn't want them to suffer anymore, police said.

[02:32:23.560 --> 02:32:27.760]
She went freely and voluntarily with the police when he arrived, didn't show any violence to anybody else.

[02:32:30.900 --> 02:32:32.360]
Landham, with an hour of each other.

[02:32:32.980 --> 02:32:37.980]
Grief counselors were on hand over the weekend to work with patients, their families and employees, nursing home administrators, Chuck Brown said.

[02:32:38.300 --> 02:32:41.820]
Right now we're just concerned with helping our residents get over this and working with our employees, he said.

[02:32:42.040 --> 02:32:44.700]
How do you like that? She put them out of their sufferings, how their pain and misery.

[02:32:46.780 --> 02:32:51.240]
A lot of people would like to put some of their siblings out of their misery. Right George?

[02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:52.700]
I love all my siblings.

[02:32:57.340 --> 02:32:57.800]
By do?

[02:32:59.700 --> 02:33:00.440]
How about your mother?

[02:33:00.860 --> 02:33:05.400]
Oh her. Well I'm talking about the things that are out of our misery, all of our siblings.

[02:33:06.120 --> 02:33:12.840]

Yes, yes, it's some kind of a home.

[02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:41.600]
There's a portal. Yeah, a portal house.

[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:42.840]
That's amazing.

[02:34:43.660 --> 02:34:44.660]
Crossing over.

[02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:48.500]
If a pet has passed, John Edward will make contact.

Okay, I'm getting a vision. I see a blank white white.

[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:55.360]
He's white. He's white.

[02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:56.780]
He's white. Yes, yes. She's a white.

[02:34:57.620 --> 02:34:58.140]
Joe.

[02:34:58.720 --> 02:34:59.580]
Terrier. Yes.

[02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:02.440]
As she wants you to know, everything's okay.

[02:35:02.580 --> 02:35:02.740]
Oh.

[02:35:02.820 --> 02:35:06.040]
She's in heaven now and drinking out of same penis oil.

[02:35:06.140 --> 02:35:07.740]
Oh, my feet.

[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:09.280]
Crossing over.

[02:35:09.500 --> 02:35:10.600]
The John Edward.

[02:35:10.980 --> 02:35:14.360]
Now your dead pets are just a phony, psychic away.

[02:35:14.700 --> 02:35:15.900]
Hey, we got some good news for you.

[02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:17.020]
I pulled today.

[02:35:17.980 --> 02:35:19.820]
We got a whole bunch of one-hit wonders on air.

[02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:21.600]
And this is the first of several polls we're going to do on this.

[02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:22.560]
Like about 6,000.

[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:25.400]
Oh, the Joe Jeffrey group, my pledge of love.

[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:27.520]
Oh, write that down, please.

[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:30.000]
I don't remember the Joe Jeffrey group.

[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:31.540]
My, this is my pledge of love to you.

[02:35:31.900 --> 02:35:33.160]
What year was that? 50 something?

[02:35:34.020 --> 02:35:34.020]

[02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:37.620]
Born in Buffalo, New York.

[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:39.660]
Joe Jeffrey, R&B singer and guitarist.

[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:42.300]
My pledge of love was up to number 14, but that was big.

[02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:43.200]
It was on the charts eight weeks.

[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:45.320]
You'd recognize it if you heard it.

[02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:47.080]
You might mark that down for one day next time.

[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:47.800]
My pledge of love.

[02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:48.760]
Yeah.

[02:35:49.300 --> 02:35:49.700]
Joe Jeffrey.

[02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:54.100]
My baby loves love, and which we find it got the name right.

[02:35:54.240 --> 02:35:54.600]
Gotta vote.

[02:35:54.880 --> 02:35:56.060]
I've got one white plan.

[02:35:56.200 --> 02:35:58.040]
Oh, I don't want to get too carried away, but it got one.

[02:35:59.300 --> 02:36:01.640]
It's got as many as human beings and alive and kicking.

[02:36:03.500 --> 02:36:04.800]
Speaking of alive and kicking,

[02:36:05.780 --> 02:36:07.840]
Jail X school teacher Mary Kay LaTournault

[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:09.880]
has now said to Mary the student she first had sex with

[02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:11.180]
when she was just 12 years old.

[02:36:11.180 --> 02:36:12.600]
When he was just 12 years old.

[02:36:12.980 --> 02:36:13.560]
Let's hear it.

[02:36:13.620 --> 02:36:14.020]
Incubate.

[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:15.960]
Vili Fula.

[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:17.240]
How do you pronounce this?

[02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:17.980]
Fulao.

[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:18.960]
Is that it?

[02:36:19.580 --> 02:36:20.940]
That's what they kept saying during the trial.

[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:23.640]
F-U-A-L-A-U.

[02:36:24.740 --> 02:36:26.240]
God, there's a lot of letters in there, A.

[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:27.680]
L.

[02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:29.640]
Off a lot of vowels in there, A.

[02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:32.820]
Vili Fulao, who fathered two girls with an out 40-year-old

[02:36:32.820 --> 02:36:34.460]
boundary in the course of their illicit affair,

[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:37.980]
has turned 18 and I want to marry this scandal-tart beauty insider.

[02:36:37.980 --> 02:36:38.680]
Say, yeah, beauty.

[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:41.160]
Why do they do that?

[02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:44.180]
Duty rhymes with duty, which is just what she looks like.

[02:36:44.540 --> 02:36:46.360]
They're very much in love reveals a pal of Mary Kay.

[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:48.720]
She's never wavered about wanting to marry Vili,

[02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:50.660]
and now he's decided that she's the only woman for him,

[02:36:50.840 --> 02:36:52.160]
probably the only woman that would touch him.

[02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:53.960]
Man, is he grotesque or what?

[02:36:54.300 --> 02:36:54.800]
Yes, quite.

[02:36:55.340 --> 02:36:57.140]
It could be a mid-summer jailhouse wedding,

[02:36:57.240 --> 02:36:58.720]
and they plan to make a video of the ceremony

[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:01.280]
in seller-world wide, and probably a bunch of suckers out there.

[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:01.700]
They'll buy it.

[02:37:01.740 --> 02:37:03.040]
Probably even some of you would buy it.

[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:05.920]
But before the odd couple can tie the knot,

[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:07.760]
Vili has to petition a judge for permission.

[02:37:08.220 --> 02:37:10.300]
Mary Kay is currently serving a seven-and-a-half year sentence

[02:37:10.300 --> 02:37:11.900]
in the women's-day prison at Pretty Washington.

[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:16.980]
When she was a 34-year-old teacher in a mama-four children

[02:37:16.980 --> 02:37:17.900]
with then-hubby Steve.

[02:37:18.580 --> 02:37:21.420]
The judge banned her from seeing her boy lover for life,

[02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:24.300]
but Vili is now an adult, could ask for that ruling to be overturned,

[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:25.720]
explained Seattle Attorney Ann Bremner,

[02:37:25.860 --> 02:37:27.280]
who's a friend of the jail teacher.

[02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:29.580]
It probably would be because there's legal precedent.

[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:32.240]
A male teacher was jailed in Washington state

[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:34.360]
for having sex with a female student was allowed to marry her

[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:35.540]
and was released from prison.

[02:37:35.740 --> 02:37:38.000]
That's a bright ray of hope for Mary Kay, they say.

[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:40.300]
Ironically, Vili and his mom, Suna,

[02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:43.520]
lost a lawsuit made 20th in which they accused the Highline School District

[02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:45.700]
in Kent, Washington of failing to protect him

[02:37:45.700 --> 02:37:47.560]
from sexual abuse at the hands of Mary Kay.

[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:49.300]
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

[02:37:49.980 --> 02:37:53.260]
Man, not that we got too many crank lawyers out there

[02:37:53.260 --> 02:37:54.700]
filing all kinds of wild lawsuits.

[02:37:55.480 --> 02:38:00.200]
They lost the lawsuit made 20th when he accused the school...

[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:03.760]
At the trial, he testified,

[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:04.700]
I loved her at least.

[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:07.660]
I thought I loved her, but now he's changed his tunes, say,

[02:38:07.740 --> 02:38:10.420]
sources and is determined to marry the bitch, Mary Her.

[02:38:10.980 --> 02:38:13.040]
One cloud in the outcouples future is Mary Kay's health.

[02:38:13.300 --> 02:38:15.660]
She has a job in the prison library, works on art projects,

[02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:17.680]
and is kept in the prison volleyball team,

[02:38:17.940 --> 02:38:20.180]
but she's also undergoing test to see if she's got cancer,

[02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:21.560]
says the rest has been Steve.

[02:38:22.220 --> 02:38:24.120]
Still, all the Shameless School teacher can talk about

[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:26.560]
his marrying Vili, and after her release moving with him

[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:29.540]
and their kids Audrey 5 and Lexus 3, their friends are Hawaii.

[02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:32.280]
She's already planning her wedding dress as the pal.

[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:34.200]
She's told friends she can't wait to walk to the altar

[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:35.140]
even in the prison chapel.

[02:38:35.460 --> 02:38:37.860]
Why see he's Hawaiian, huh? That's why he's got all his age in his name.

[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:41.800]
Now, I've been in Hawaii many, many times, and I got this word.

[02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:43.860]
The only really grotesque people there

[02:38:43.860 --> 02:38:46.060]
like the sumo wrestler kind of guy, you know what I'm talking about?

[02:38:46.060 --> 02:38:50.120]
Right. The big fat tubs, but I guess he's one of them without the body.

[02:38:50.260 --> 02:38:52.040]
You know what I'm all the fat? Give me time.

[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:52.860]
He's got...

[02:38:55.280 --> 02:38:57.220]
This may look like Robbie Benson.

[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:00.880]
I'll speak in a billy old-debili Joe Bobby Gentry.

[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:02.420]
Now, did we decide she had another head?

[02:39:02.620 --> 02:39:03.320]
You had to look it up.

[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:04.200]
Oh!

[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:06.980]
I'm telling you, man, I'm getting the hernia.

[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:10.160]
I'm filing a lawsuit against Billboard for making such a heavy book.

[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:13.520]
Bobby Gentry, not a night, wasn't I playing that this morning?

[02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:14.440]
You were?

[02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:16.260]
Oh, right now that I have that.

[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:19.120]
You got me?

[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:21.180]
Well, what do you mean I got you?

[02:39:21.260 --> 02:39:22.180]
I don't know what you had it from.

[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:23.840]
We have some interlude music though.

[02:39:24.380 --> 02:39:25.880]
Well, guess what? It doesn't qualify anyway.

[02:39:28.780 --> 02:39:30.240]
Oh, bandit gold, feeder pain.

[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:35.180]
Excellent. And that on our thing today, probably not doing all that well.

[02:39:36.100 --> 02:39:36.580]
Good song.

[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:39.200]
Now, what am I looking for? The old-debili Joe?

[02:39:39.380 --> 02:39:40.760]
I'm probably just as well if I don't find it.

[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:41.620]
Oh, I guess what?

[02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:43.780]
It's right before Runaway 67 by Del Shannon.

[02:39:44.140 --> 02:39:46.120]
I think it was just after that that he blew his brains up.

[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:47.440]
After he recorded that piece of crap.

[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:51.580]
About Runaway 67, he came to anything else right?

[02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:55.080]
And he said, that's a good idea.

[02:39:56.980 --> 02:39:57.480]
Hey, Robbie.

[02:39:57.880 --> 02:39:59.160]
Robbie just done it with some old guy.

[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:04.160]
Was a third of June another sleepy, dusty, day out today.

[02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:06.580]
Don't drop Robbie or a young man.

[02:40:06.760 --> 02:40:07.460]
You got your whole life ahead.

[02:40:07.740 --> 02:40:10.720]
I was out chopping cotton in my brother.

[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:14.420]
So how many times do we have to hear that is a grandfather was the first rabbi in the state of Texas?

[02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:15.280]
Isn't that getting a little bit old?

[02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:18.180]
I didn't know that.

[02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:20.380]
Well, you just learned that.

[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:22.780]
More very startling information on the New York Times show.

[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:24.360]
Well, that's because you're anti-Semitic.

[02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:24.620]
Oh.

[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:28.860]
Bobby Gentry, Odebili Joe was number one for four weeks in August of 67.

[02:40:29.700 --> 02:40:31.840]
Then she also had let it be me with Glenn Campbell.

[02:40:32.660 --> 02:40:33.020]
Fancy.

[02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:34.280]
I remember Fancy.

[02:40:34.460 --> 02:40:38.400]
And then all I have to do is dream which he sang with Glenn Campbell and ripped off the Everly Brothers.

[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:39.740]
And we're still ever forgiven for that.

[02:40:39.900 --> 02:40:40.740]
That freaking bitch.

[02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:42.440]
I was bailin' hey.

[02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:43.500]
Get outta here, Bobby.

[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:45.460]
Go back and jump off the bridge with Robbie.

[02:40:46.140 --> 02:40:48.160]
Robbie Benson to just turn 92, I should point out.

[02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:49.380]
How old do you think he is?

[02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:51.120]
He's got to be 45.

[02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:51.820]
At least.

[02:40:52.340 --> 02:40:52.900]
Is that you?

[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.400]
And he knows something the sad part of it is he probably still looks the same.

[02:40:55.760 --> 02:40:56.040]
He does.

[02:40:56.580 --> 02:41:00.100]
He's one of those people who never broke out of his childhood and always he always looked the same.

[02:41:00.180 --> 02:41:01.980]
Which is probably why I couldn't get like any serious roles.

[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:04.440]
Remember you played the rabbi's kid or something like that in one movie?

[02:41:05.260 --> 02:41:06.020]
I saw that movie.

[02:41:06.020 --> 02:41:08.980]
The baseball one, the one that starts out there playing stick ball or something like that.

[02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:09.760]
I don't know, I didn't see it.

[02:41:09.820 --> 02:41:10.980]
And then he was in a movie with a monkey.

[02:41:12.260 --> 02:41:14.320]
And he was in that basketball movie one on one.

[02:41:14.540 --> 02:41:15.200]
That was pretty good movie.

[02:41:15.420 --> 02:41:15.860]
I mean, you know.

[02:41:16.420 --> 02:41:16.740]
Huh?

[02:41:18.140 --> 02:41:19.300]
You didn't see one on one?

[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:20.980]
No, I'm talking about the one with a monkey.

[02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:24.680]
Where he told you your coach to stick it with a red hot poker to stick it like up his...

[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:25.020]
RECOM.

[02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:25.400]
Ask.

[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:31.480]
Speaking of John Gotti and somebody should tell the examineries that I realized I clipped his up before he died.

[02:41:31.640 --> 02:41:34.100]
But you know, considering they have all those psychics in the tabloids,

[02:41:34.100 --> 02:41:35.300]
wouldn't you think they would know ahead of time?

[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:36.400]
That he was going to die yesterday?

[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:38.960]
I sure knew it.

[02:41:38.980 --> 02:41:41.100]
Blog got that inspiration to read that Gotti's story almost...

[02:41:41.700 --> 02:41:43.200]
Almost a minute that he died.

[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:44.620]
Do you get it?

[02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:45.280]
Ten minutes later.

[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:46.020]
Probably took...

[02:41:46.020 --> 02:41:47.100]
It took ten minutes for the psychic...

[02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:50.820]
...to show today.

[02:41:52.300 --> 02:41:52.620]
Okay.

[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:54.440]
I'm serious.

[02:41:54.540 --> 02:41:54.880]
I'll back.

[02:41:54.980 --> 02:41:55.340]
No, no, no.

[02:41:55.340 --> 02:41:57.700]
I don't wish any ill health on anybody in the world.

[02:41:58.020 --> 02:41:59.940]
But in this case, I'll make an exception.

[02:42:00.060 --> 02:42:01.280]
Just like Michael and the Godfather.

[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:03.740]
Just this one time, I'll make an exception.

[02:42:05.740 --> 02:42:07.680]
And the reason being, not that we...

[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:11.020]
I didn't hate people who are not before yesterday, but now we find out...

[02:42:11.020 --> 02:42:11.600]
You're last name.

[02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:13.780]
Got fired by people who are over there, I.O.D. and I.N.Z.

[02:42:14.020 --> 02:42:15.920]
Phil Latsman, who's kind of like an innocuous guy.

[02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:17.460]
He knows a little bit about sports.

[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:18.780]
He never stole a freight train.

[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:19.680]
He's not a troublemaker.

[02:42:19.900 --> 02:42:21.000]
He's a pretty decent guy.

[02:42:21.140 --> 02:42:21.700]
You're last name.

[02:42:21.700 --> 02:42:25.340]
And he gets stabbed in a back by people who are the assassin over there at Cheap Channel.

[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:30.020]
So, before the end of the show today, we're going to put a goddamn voodoo hex of curse...

[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:31.700]
on Pete Borgher.

[02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:35.940]
Because if he gets struck by a bolt of lightning,

[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:39.880]
if he should drive off the edge of the etsylphore to expressway and detroit,

[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:44.020]
if somebody should run him over across in the street, then...

[02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:45.440]
Then I'll say,

[02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:46.140]
All right!

[02:42:47.020 --> 02:42:48.080]
Anyway, getting back to the mob.

[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:52.340]
Uncle Vito needs you, and now more than ever, another John Gotti's dead.

[02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:53.700]
Help wanted.

[02:42:53.860 --> 02:42:55.500]
Can you shoot a bullet in the back of somebody's head?

[02:42:56.260 --> 02:42:58.180]
Can you run gambling in a storsion operations?

[02:42:58.180 --> 02:43:00.060]
Are you good at blackmail and driving and get away car?

[02:43:00.340 --> 02:43:01.920]
Can you cram a zonny into your mouth and say,

[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:03.540]
Forget about it at the same time?

[02:43:04.060 --> 02:43:05.940]
If your answers are yes, then here's a job for you.

[02:43:06.260 --> 02:43:09.220]
The mob is looking for a few bad men to take over for dead and...

[02:43:12.420 --> 02:43:13.060]
If he...

[02:43:13.060 --> 02:43:15.760]
I think I probably will do it since it's my goddamn show.

[02:43:15.880 --> 02:43:16.560]
I think that's what I'll do.

[02:43:16.820 --> 02:43:17.660]
I don't want to rush through it.

[02:43:18.920 --> 02:43:21.880]
Because we savor every little tidbit, everything about the mob.

[02:43:21.980 --> 02:43:23.280]
We love the mob on this show, don't we?

[02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:30.380]
I have to do a escalfonantial group at 1-800-94053-63.

[02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:33.120]
That's 1-800-94053-63.

[02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:36.280]
To be more specific, you can get 100 grand with payments of only...

[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:41.380]
Come on, Jackson, we win on all the action.

[02:43:41.580 --> 02:43:43.760]
We are worldwide leader in sports.

[02:43:44.060 --> 02:43:46.860]
Sports Radio 560-EU-A-M.

[02:43:47.020 --> 02:43:48.520]
Gotta keep your shots straight here.

[02:43:49.820 --> 02:43:55.520]
With his trusty card, Eka, took shots of Eriola.

[02:43:56.660 --> 02:44:02.500]
He compared their nipple size, but he messed up no surprise.

[02:44:03.060 --> 02:44:04.540]
What a big bonehead!

[02:44:05.980 --> 02:44:10.520]
Colped out with his camera, said he had shots of...

[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:15.180]
And a buddy must have smoked some tubes.

[02:44:15.180 --> 02:44:18.320]
They were someone else's boobs.

[02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:21.500]
This guy is a major tool.

[02:44:21.940 --> 02:44:24.180]
At first he thought it was to...

[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:27.640]
Never check the lady's face.

[02:44:28.180 --> 02:44:30.880]
That's why he's in this card case.

[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:32.180]
He's a freaking fool.

[02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:33.880]
A quack.

[02:44:34.420 --> 02:44:37.200]
They should take his camera back.

[02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:40.360]
None of this makes any sense.

[02:44:40.580 --> 02:44:41.980]
What's with the nipple?

[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:43.360]
The fence.

[02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:45.320]
It's a freaking crock.

[02:44:45.380 --> 02:44:48.740]
Please, please, please, I bought it with the tennis girl.

[02:44:49.220 --> 02:44:51.280]
I started laying there on the beach and I said,

[02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:53.300]
That's crazy, I'm gonna come with boobs.

[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:54.520]
It's Call of Duty!

[02:44:54.820 --> 02:44:57.220]
Hope they make him pay millions.

[02:44:57.980 --> 02:45:00.780]
Cause he shot the wrong melons.

[02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:03.760]
And approved that they were hers.

[02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:06.360]
They were banning ten knockers.

[02:45:07.220 --> 02:45:08.740]
What a big bonehead.

[02:45:09.460 --> 02:45:12.320]
Okay, gotta look in a book here for a million different things though.

[02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:13.080]
They're coming on the facts.

[02:45:13.180 --> 02:45:15.320]
Did he just all start coming in like recently or what?

[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:18.480]
Like I said, I was sorting out the ones that we already had.

[02:45:19.020 --> 02:45:21.180]
Okay, Brownsville station smoking in the boys room.

[02:45:21.180 --> 02:45:23.220]
Which we also talked about off the year before the show.

[02:45:23.300 --> 02:45:23.740]
But guess what?

[02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:24.340]
It's...

[02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:25.980]
Sorry, Frank.

[02:45:26.300 --> 02:45:26.440]
Right.

[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:29.760]
Some of the kings of the party reached number 31, so they had another hit.

[02:45:30.060 --> 02:45:30.180]
Sorry.

[02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:32.800]
Electrocavenu by Eddie Grant.

[02:45:32.980 --> 02:45:33.380]
You remember that?

[02:45:33.620 --> 02:45:35.000]
Yeah, I was on MTV for a while.

[02:45:35.900 --> 02:45:37.340]
Rage sounding kind of.

[02:45:38.100 --> 02:45:38.320]
Oh.

[02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:39.500]
Well, let me see.

[02:45:39.580 --> 02:45:40.260]
Here's Amy Grant.

[02:45:40.260 --> 02:45:41.380]
Here's Earl Grant.

[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:42.800]
Here's Eddie Grant.

[02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:43.260]
And guess what?

[02:45:45.140 --> 02:45:46.100]
Remanting the stone.

[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:47.440]
Oh, yeah, from the movie.

[02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:49.460]
Like my mother said, what's that movie all about?

[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:50.440]
She got very upset with you.

[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:51.100]
You heard the name of that movie?

[02:45:52.620 --> 02:45:53.760]
Well, you can only use your own.

[02:45:53.900 --> 02:45:55.800]
And you see, you're supposed to be a pervert.

[02:45:55.860 --> 02:45:57.960]
And I'm of course a sub pro claim pervert.

[02:45:58.120 --> 02:45:59.260]
And yet she hears the name of a movie.

[02:45:59.420 --> 02:46:00.320]
Remanting the stone.

[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:01.360]
And right away, she's there.

[02:46:01.420 --> 02:46:02.200]
Oh, what's that about?

[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:02.700]
It is.

[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:04.360]
Her mind is filthier than both of us.

[02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:04.740]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:06.300]
She's got a filthy mind, ma.

[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:09.540]
Electric Avenue was number two for five weeks by Eddie Grant.

[02:46:09.540 --> 02:46:11.080]
But he don't make the, uh, okay.

[02:46:11.500 --> 02:46:13.300]
Here's one that does make it.

[02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:15.820]
Tom Cochrane life is a highway.

[02:46:17.220 --> 02:46:17.760]
Remember that?

[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:19.040]
Yeah, and I'm writing it.

[02:46:19.220 --> 02:46:20.360]
Well, I looked it up already.

[02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:21.580]
That was a medley of a smash.

[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:22.320]
Tom Cochrane.

[02:46:22.480 --> 02:46:23.180]
How you spell that?

[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:28.760]
CoCHRANE.

[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:29.280]
Okay.

[02:46:29.660 --> 02:46:31.820]
Similar to, but not a match with the Johnny Cochrane.

[02:46:32.500 --> 02:46:34.700]
It says, can you tell me the name of the Billboard One hit wonderboard?

[02:46:34.700 --> 02:46:36.580]
Well, I don't have the one hit wonder book.

[02:46:38.340 --> 02:46:43.260]
I mean, I'm reading from the Billboard The Top 40 hits book, which is a big fat thick.

[02:46:43.520 --> 02:46:46.200]
It's big and it's fat and it's thick and a book to over 800 pages.

[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:50.400]
But there is, in fact, if you go to that website, what is it, the website that Eric was touting?

[02:46:51.600 --> 02:46:52.340]
That he finally found out.

[02:46:52.340 --> 02:46:53.000]
Now you ask me.

[02:46:53.660 --> 02:46:53.780]
Huh?

[02:46:54.820 --> 02:46:57.180]
I just, I just had it up there on the website too.

[02:46:57.340 --> 02:46:58.360]
Well, go to the Hig and Wonders.

[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:01.000]
One hit wonder central dot com.

[02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:01.540]
All one word.

[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:04.280]
No, as a matter of fact, just do a search for one hit wonders.

[02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:08.360]
And on there, one of the things that'll come up is the Billboard The Book.

[02:47:08.460 --> 02:47:11.800]
You can order it right off of there from Amazon or just just go to Amazon dot com if you want.

[02:47:11.900 --> 02:47:12.180]
Either way.

[02:47:13.080 --> 02:47:15.980]
And you can order the book because I can't find it myself and a book either.

[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:19.560]
And let's see, as this go Red Wing kicks her hurricane asses, that's right.

[02:47:19.700 --> 02:47:23.640]
Get it over with already on Thursday and how come they got two days off for the TV networks again?

[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:24.500]
Jesus Christ.

[02:47:24.980 --> 02:47:27.120]
Get it over with as much as I'm a hockey fan and I love it.

[02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:29.180]
First of all, Carolina makes me ill.

[02:47:29.320 --> 02:47:30.980]
Not just because they beat the leaps because they're boring.

[02:47:30.980 --> 02:47:32.460]
They're coma inducing.

[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:38.400]
They've been and even though the ratings are up both in the US and in Canada, they don't ask me why

[02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:41.220]
because they've played some of the most terminal hockey I've seen in my life.

[02:47:41.220 --> 02:47:44.860]
All those one nothing and two to one and, oh, God.

[02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:48.400]
Any real fan wants to see some goal scored, God damn it.

[02:47:48.660 --> 02:47:52.260]
Not this ponderous clutch and grab and trap crap.

[02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:53.680]
Anyway, get it over with.

[02:47:53.700 --> 02:47:54.180]
Please Thursday.

[02:47:54.220 --> 02:47:54.660]
Detroit.

[02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:55.300]
Thank you.

[02:47:55.800 --> 02:47:57.740]
Let's see Mississippi queen by mountain.

[02:47:57.760 --> 02:47:58.840]
Ah, here we go again.

[02:47:59.140 --> 02:48:01.360]
Just when I put the book down, I got to pick it up again.

[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:02.720]
I feel like I'd email Pacino.

[02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:08.700]
They insist these nuts, not a one-hit wonder mountain and Mississippi queen because of this

[02:48:08.700 --> 02:48:09.420]
and because of that.

[02:48:09.620 --> 02:48:10.760]
So let me look it up, okay?

[02:48:11.940 --> 02:48:14.040]
Do we agree we'll buy by whatever it says in the book?

[02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:14.720]
Whatever it says in the book.

[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:15.040]
Mountain.

[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:16.560]
Mississippi queen.

[02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:17.900]
They're only hit.

[02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:20.480]
Oh, I didn't know this.

[02:48:22.940 --> 02:48:27.140]
Felix Papalardi played guitar with a member of the group and then of course went on to be with the wrestlers.

[02:48:27.140 --> 02:48:30.620]
Did you know he was shot to death on 417, 1983 at the age of 44?

[02:48:30.900 --> 02:48:32.140]
No, I never knew that.

[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:34.380]
Oh, my God.

[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:36.440]
Felix Papalardi, the young rascals.

[02:48:37.540 --> 02:48:39.380]
I don't think I'm ever going to be the same again.

[02:48:40.380 --> 02:48:43.720]
It says it's not really one-hit wonder the group with guitarist, Leslie Weston, keyboard man.

[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:45.160]
Felix Papalardi had many classics.

[02:48:45.380 --> 02:48:51.400]
For example, Yazger's Farm Woodstock, Boys in the Band, Nantucket Slay Ride, Papalardi Road

[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:52.740]
dozens of classics with the rascals.

[02:48:53.100 --> 02:48:55.160]
Leslie Weston was one of the great guitars to the era.

[02:48:56.900 --> 02:48:57.720]
Well, let's see.

[02:48:57.880 --> 02:48:58.940]
Glitter Rhyme, where am I?

[02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:05.240]
Male Hard Rock group in New York City, Leslie West, Vocals in Bays, Felix Papalardi guitar, Steve Knight keyboards, and Korky Lane drums.

[02:49:05.700 --> 02:49:07.220]
Papalardi was shot to the Vagor City III.

[02:49:07.420 --> 02:49:08.840]
But that was their only hit Mississippi queen.

[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:10.280]
So we stand by it, okay?

[02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:11.560]
For once we got it right.

[02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:13.040]
Just this one time we got it right.

[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:16.840]
Here's another one, Starlight Express, afternoon delight.

[02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:17.920]
Oh, boy.

[02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:19.460]
Yeah, exactly. That's my feelings.

[02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:20.260]
But I'll look it up.

[02:49:20.500 --> 02:49:21.940]
I think it qualifies that.

[02:49:22.660 --> 02:49:29.740]
Now you would imagine so after you remember that piece of, I mean, Brenda K. Starr is the one star, buddy, Starrcher.

[02:49:31.880 --> 02:49:34.400]
Here's one for you that I find by accident.

[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:35.540]
Yeah.

[02:49:36.980 --> 02:49:38.920]
Starland Vocal Band afternoon delight.

[02:49:41.580 --> 02:49:42.880]
They have the wrong name of the group.

[02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:46.040]
It's not Starlight Express. It's the Starland Vocal Band.

[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:48.100]
Oh, they do have Starlight Express on this.

[02:49:48.100 --> 02:49:50.560]
Yeah, hey Joel, you know, you're like partly right.

[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:52.900]
You're like better, you know, I mean, get with it, Joel.

[02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:55.700]
What about that brother's Johnson?

[02:49:57.640 --> 02:49:58.600]
Probably pretty big.

[02:50:03.480 --> 02:50:05.200]
I thought they had other songs than that.

[02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:08.640]
Hey, I'm busy cleaning my foot up.

[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:09.320]
You know what I just did?

[02:50:09.680 --> 02:50:13.240]
You ever cut your ankle with like the sharp nail of a toe?

[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:15.200]
Not with my toe. No.

[02:50:15.700 --> 02:50:16.280]
Other things.

[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:17.680]
Sharp other things.

[02:50:18.820 --> 02:50:22.140]
Are you bleeding all over the, just like, no, not all over the places a little bit.

[02:50:22.140 --> 02:50:23.700]
I'm just doing a little clean up job down there.

[02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:25.260]
Okay, just relax. It's not a big deal.

[02:50:26.580 --> 02:50:27.420]
Not signed as well.

[02:50:27.540 --> 02:50:31.980]
Well, you know, anyway, Starland Vocal Band afternoon delight was number one for two weeks.

[02:50:31.980 --> 02:50:34.440]
That was the medley of their smash pop group form to Washington DC.

[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:38.580]
Bill and wife Taffy Danoff, John Carroll and future wife, Margot Chapman.

[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:43.860]
Bill and Taffy at front of the Folk quintet, Fat City, back in Denver, our Technicom Country Road,

[02:50:44.020 --> 02:50:46.240]
hosted their own TV variety series in 1977.

[02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:51.060]
Well, the 1976 Best New Artists Grammy Award afternoon delight number one for two weeks in 1976.

[02:50:52.100 --> 02:50:52.740]
Hate it.

[02:50:54.180 --> 02:50:55.900]
And now we got to look up the brothers Johnson.

[02:50:58.520 --> 02:51:01.360]
I don't want to see the brothers Johnson just a thought of it.

[02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:07.020]
Here you go. No, they got all they had stomped and so I brought 23 and get the funk out of my face.

[02:51:07.220 --> 02:51:10.600]
And I'll be good to you. That's funk with an end, by the way, just in case face.

[02:51:11.360 --> 02:51:12.320]
So thank you very much.

[02:51:12.380 --> 02:51:15.520]
Can I get back to my story about the mob wants you because probably a lot of people out there.

[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:17.460]
If they're not going to call fast, maybe they'd call the mob.

[02:51:20.100 --> 02:51:26.600]
Experts say ranks of New York's five organized crime plans have dropped from 634 soldiers to mere 570 full-time gumbas.

[02:51:27.040 --> 02:51:30.560]
Mob bosses like John Gagati are in the big house. It says, guess what?

[02:51:31.660 --> 02:51:32.020]
Dead.

[02:51:32.580 --> 02:51:36.860]
While others have turned into songbirds for the feds, not to mention those who've gone to the big crime cloud in the sky.

[02:51:37.340 --> 02:51:40.220]
And something's got to be done. You have to inject blood into the family says a source.

[02:51:40.220 --> 02:51:46.780]
Inside us say two of the top clans, the Genevase and Lucaisy folks, have officially opened the books hoping to induct new members.

[02:51:47.360 --> 02:51:54.380]
You can also apply to the Columbus who lost 26 good fellows in recent years or the bananas who've seen five of their guys, made guys go missing.

[02:51:55.440 --> 02:52:03.800]
The de Cavalentes, the New Jersey based group of no good nicks on which they're based, they based the sopranos, already are on a recruiting drive that's added eight new hoods to their books.

[02:52:04.600 --> 02:52:09.300]
But they still need more help to carry out their notorious enterprises. That's why they're putting the word out on the street.

[02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:11.040]
How do you apply wonder?

[02:52:12.420 --> 02:52:13.300]
Facts of Resonay.

[02:52:15.100 --> 02:52:21.800]
It's not easy to become a good fellow, though. First your name has to be circulated around through the bosses and then may take a little while considering a lot of them are doing time in the pen.

[02:52:22.260 --> 02:52:28.440]
If you get the okay from underworld mob figures, you have to go through official initiation process and we're not taking talking secret handshake here.

[02:52:28.940 --> 02:52:36.640]
The ceremony includes burning a saint's picture in the bleeding palm of an inductee as he takes the oath of Omar Ta, a found-ever in the divulge he tells the family's business.

[02:52:37.260 --> 02:52:42.260]
Because if you do, you'll be sleeping with the fishes. There's no buyout package or 401k plan in this biz.

[02:52:43.020 --> 02:52:51.640]
And don't forget a nickname if you're an accountant whose real man, a man, a career is William Nelson, forget about it. On your mob application, try something like William the Crunchy Nelson. Maybe then you'll see any change.

[02:52:53.680 --> 02:52:54.640]
Love those nicknames.

[02:52:55.980 --> 02:52:57.440]
Oh, here's some good news finally.

[02:52:59.620 --> 02:53:03.140]
Two pieces of good news while we head to bad news about radio marty. Here's some good news.

[02:53:03.680 --> 02:53:15.020]
Miami Beach will land with reputations the capital of the Latin music industry this fall when South Beach, South Beach based MTV Latino America premieres the MTV Music Video Music Awards Latino America Jackie Gleason Theater.

[02:53:16.460 --> 02:53:24.480]
All right, a Spanish language version of the parents, a network's popular and transcending MTV Video Music Awards. The show will reflect the growing popularity of Latin rock and pop.

[02:53:24.920 --> 02:53:29.460]
Approximately 80% of the word categories will feature Latin American artists who make up three-fisted performers.

[02:53:29.460 --> 02:53:39.700]
The live broadcast of the October 24th award show will be available in 12 million households in Latin America and made available to MTV's other neighbors in the US, Europe and Asia, which will have a worldwide reach of 3.2 million homes.

[02:53:40.780 --> 02:53:47.600]
What's the date for that? October 24th. I'll be back in South Florida. Maybe we can go there. Well, you can take my ticket. Okay.

[02:53:49.800 --> 02:53:57.280]
MTV Latin American president Antoinette Zell said the industry, oh, I'm by the way, congratulations to Ann Rique. He finally said, you know, he finally figured it out like Brittany.

[02:53:57.900 --> 02:54:05.040]
He's doing a Brittany thing now. Forget about singing anymore. He just selling sex. That's all selling his body. I think they have a word for that.

[02:54:05.740 --> 02:54:13.840]
MTV Latin American president Antoinette Zell said the industry, synergy and civic support in South Beach where the channel has been based in launching in 1993, made an ideal spot to kick off the show.

[02:54:13.940 --> 02:54:20.520]
There's so much talent and labels are here. She said, and the city's really been fabulous since our inception from finding us real estate, helping us with the show.

[02:54:20.520 --> 02:54:30.340]
As with the US MTV music awards, most windows will be determined by votes from viewers. Charlie Singer, the shows executive producer, said nominees, performers and awards categories will be announced in the next few weeks.

[02:54:30.880 --> 02:54:35.400]
Miami Beach Mayor David Dürmer said the MTV event is an important addition to the city's reputation and economy.

[02:54:36.220 --> 02:54:46.040]
There are some, this is basically solidifying the fact that Miami Beach is the entertainment capital of the Americas and the center of Latin American music industry. Dürmer said it's probably the single largest music event ever to be broadcast from the city.

[02:54:46.040 --> 02:54:57.060]
The special events give us recognition that advertising can never buy. I keep hearing it, South Beach is on a way out. You hear that? All the time. Everybody's selling out, everybody's moving out.

[02:54:57.680 --> 02:55:06.220]
I just mentioned that so that what's your name can, you know, Barbara Kavitman can spin around or grave a little bit. Now we didn't need gambling, Barbara, we got art's record, baby.

[02:55:08.980 --> 02:55:16.860]

[02:56:10.300 --> 02:56:18.760]
Power demon and steam Gold Eagle steam with morning through 69 and sports radio 560 2 a.m. Oh my God.

[02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:07.140]
Cup 46 at 560 WQ a mad dog back today after Joe Rosas in yesterday stealing our program logs.

[02:57:08.700 --> 02:57:19.520]
Here's a fact that says and you know it's amazing how you know granted we make plenty of mistakes and will be the first ones to tell you when we screw up which we do a lot but this one says alive and kicking is Tommy James. Well guess what?

[02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:32.860]
Tommy James and nothing to it alive and kicking pop rock group from New York City Peppy Cardona male vocals Sandy Toto female vocals John Perizio guitar Bruce Sedano organ Thomas Wilson bass and Vito Albano.

[02:57:34.120 --> 02:57:41.660]
This sounds like a new mob family don't it? Vito Albano drums Sedano later married Donna Summer and was a member of Brooklyn Dreams.

[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:49.060]
But alive and kicking and tighter and tighter which reached number 7 and 1970 that was a medley of this match Tommy James had nothing to do with that.

[02:57:49.580 --> 02:57:59.540]
What does that mean? I don't know either. Do you think maybe that was an aim of one of his songs Tommy James and his Shawn L's alive and kicking? It might have been. Maybe that's what they meant.

[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:08.540]
Let's see no it was not so I don't have no idea who wrote this G. E. C. Riley Harper Valley PTA that's a good one.

[02:58:08.540 --> 02:58:16.600]
Yep but I think she had something else. Not that big but on the heels of it. How do you spell G. E. C. Riley?

[02:58:18.140 --> 02:58:28.220]
She stole it. Are you I? No sir. That's not R. E. I. L. L. Y. No. What I would guess. No. How about just R. I. L. E. Y. It's got a boring. All right.

[02:58:29.620 --> 02:58:35.280]
The end rhymes G. E. C. Riley good one. Redeemed yourself on his facts. Write that down for next time.

[02:58:36.500 --> 02:58:45.440]
Number one for week in 1968 Harper Valley PTA a medley of her smash written by Tom T. Hall. No less. Also it says Bobby Bland also had

[02:58:45.440 --> 02:58:50.600]
lived a little girl dancing true on your love light and I'm trying to think why is he a right about Bobby Bland and you want to know why?

[02:58:50.600 --> 02:58:59.440]
Why? Maybe I miss spoke when I was talking about Montego Bay and I said Bobby Bland. Bobby Bloom had Montego Bay not Bobby Bland.

[02:58:59.520 --> 02:59:04.880]
You must have miss spoke because it's right here on the CD and we've been reading it off the CD.

[02:59:06.360 --> 02:59:09.420]
Bobby Bloom Bloom. Okay got it. How about Brian?

[02:59:09.680 --> 02:59:15.780]
Somebody said something about when we were talking about the Cavalier or when you were talking about one of the young

[02:59:16.420 --> 02:59:22.260]
rascals. We look Cavalier. Yeah. Felix Cavalier is the guy but you were saying some different name because that's what the fact said or something.

[02:59:22.840 --> 02:59:26.220]
Yeah. Mandage called up and dove was correcting us on that.

[02:59:27.600 --> 02:59:33.080]
And correct it this on what? Because we were you were saying some different name other than Felix Cavalier.

[02:59:33.580 --> 02:59:42.440]
Oh my god. Come to butt out. Come to stick with Tom Brady. Okay. He probably like to. Anyway now speaking of Bobby Bloom see it's amazing.

[02:59:42.440 --> 02:59:51.560]
The one thing I love about these billboard top 40 books. Not only do they have artists by artists all their hits and then you go in the back and they've got them alphabetically by the name of the song.

[02:59:51.780 --> 03:00:00.340]
If you wouldn't know the title of the song you see who the artist was all kinds of good stuff all kinds of charts but under each artist they've got for example in the groups they have the name of each member.

[03:00:00.540 --> 03:00:09.500]
And if they're still alive things like that Bobby Bloom born in 1945 in New York City died from an accidental shooting on 228.748.28.

[03:00:09.500 --> 03:00:19.320]
How do you like that huh? No idea. Top singer songwriter much session work in the 1960s but is only hit Montego Bay reached number eight October 1970.

[03:00:20.160 --> 03:00:32.160]
Bobby Bloom not Bobby Bland Bobby Bloom okay. This guy probably heard Joseph Gackie last week and was thinking more like Bland you know what I'm saying. Bland like Joseph Gackie.

[03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:50.020]

[03:03:41.660 --> 03:03:47.880]
We take a good hard stiff look and to start up this British fans big hit was either a song about a

[03:03:47.880 --> 03:03:49.880]
Some homosexual encounter or masturbation

[03:03:50.680 --> 03:03:54.780]

Chet Stools talks about the bands only hit love plus one it's saying pretty clear to me

[03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:22.640]
That's a fellow saying I just gave into the sensual delights of anal sex I mean I think still others think love plus one refers to a third sex partner

[03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:31.840]
Like 80s rock groupie Melissa Schuster who has been a third sex partner with such luminaries as the guy who sang back up on that one springsteen tour

[03:04:31.840 --> 03:04:33.720]
And the human leagues dog

[03:04:33.720 --> 03:04:35.640]
And I have a skink you third sex partner

[03:04:35.640 --> 03:04:40.340]
I can't help but think love plus one is about being a third sex partner

[03:04:40.340 --> 03:04:48.460]
But was this song really only a reference to being alone and needing to use your hand was Rosie poem the plus one referred to in the title

[03:04:48.460 --> 03:04:56.700]
The bands lead singer Nick Hayward may have provided a clue back in 1982 when he said it's pretty much a song about wiking off

Okay

[03:05:28.820 --> 03:05:34.900]
And you went right along with it by the way see how easy you were because I've already forgotten about Felix Cavalier in the young rascals

[03:05:34.900 --> 03:05:41.240]
Why is that well because I remember them but I keep forgetting about him because his solo career was ever so well
