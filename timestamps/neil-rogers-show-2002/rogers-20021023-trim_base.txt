[00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.460]
He's all choked up he can't help himself.

[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.100]
Delby, Delby, talking on a sports show.

[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.660]
Trying to be my show.

[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.680]
Your voice sounds just like a sad, then-year-old girl.

[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.880]
A little sports host, she'll...

[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.900]
What else are you there for?

[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.440]
Delby, Delby, talking like a baby.

[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.360]
Who needs a little training?

[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.460]
Why can't you understand?

[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.580]
You don't sound like a man.

[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.780]
Remove the rubber bands and choke.

[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.580]
Your scrubs come guilty.

[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.620]
Delby, delby, delby.

[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.500]
Deldy, your lucky man is fit to care.

[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.100]
Cause, Kelly, you don't feel

[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.380]
long there on the air.

[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.820]
And, Kelly, the sports can wait till your voice cracks.

[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.300]
Cause, anyone who sounds like that should find another job.

[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.940]
And they should only take you back when both your babies drop.

[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.000]
Elk-elty, delby.

[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.180]
When you're gonna grow up, you make us want to grow up.

[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.280]
You feel these squeaky pooh, go to broadcasting school.

[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.400]
Your pretty, you bastard voice makes you sound like a plus.

[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.300]
Your a-hats.

[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.240]
Your a-hats.

[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.800]
Your a-hats.

[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.420]
You have a great day too, Gildy, and Paradise.

[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.280]
You'll ever be able to do that.

[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.940]
Who's into the moron hour at 9 o'clock, you'll hear more?

[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.100]
Okay, here we go with more 903-560-WDQM.

[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.540]
At least it's a little something.

[00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.720]
It's a little bit of an open there.

[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.260]
Promoted the McBride jet bush debate.

[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.020]
I didn't even watch it.

[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.680]
Cause I've already decided I'm gonna vote for it.

[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.800]
Whatever I watch that, you know, terminal.

[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.440]
Right.

[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.960]
And I sure wouldn't put Robert Greeper as much as we like Robert.

[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.320]
You know, if anybody thought the beast was unprofessional

[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.520]
and didn't belong on the air, I mean, Robert's a good guy,

[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.620]
but does he belong on the air?

[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.820]
No.

[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.580]
Even to say hello?

[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.920]
No.

[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.180]
So the idea that I would put him on to like critique the,

[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.340]
in addition to which keeping his politics in mind,

[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.840]
him critiquing a debate among any candidates

[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.080]
or between or above.

[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.100]
And anyway, we don't want to get bogged down on that crap.

[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.020]
We got plenty of other crap.

[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.440]
How is Fat Boy doing with those hour by hours, by the way?

[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.120]
As soon as they come in.

[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.300]
I got news for him.

[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.500]
Unless he comes through with that in the next hour or two,

[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.880]
he's not going on no trip to Vegas.

[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.120]
Today's the day our sales department's leaving for a week in Vegas

[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.860]
because they did such a wonderful job.

[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.600]
It's July and August and Sputth of the fact that George was on.

[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.300]
And Moe.

[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.600]
Oh, sorry.

[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.000]
How low can you go?

[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.320]
Oh, that's what we'd like to find out.

[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.680]
When we see those hour by hours.

[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.320]
Because that's what it's all about, sweetheart.

[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.300]
That's what it's all about is, you know,

[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.400]
coming through with the production produce something.

[00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.840]
Not talking a big game.

[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.940]
Not talking about how we sound better than ever before.

[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.080]
Let's see what you've got.

[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.700]
What do you got?

[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.760]
What do you bring to the table?

[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.640]
Who you got out there?

[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.640]
Where's the audience?

[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.840]
You know, that's what it's all about.

[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.800]
Not being pompous in the full of crap.

[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.220]
Anyway, so, uh, Gildi, I guess, had a little plug there

[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.580]
from one of the callers about 20 of.

[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.660]
And even that took, they took coverage with.

[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.620]
Well, I don't think Gildi did.

[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.300]
Because when we first came here and started playing that song,

[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.780]
Gildi was going out and performing it live,

[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]
which I find is shocking, but he was like lip-syncing it

[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.180]
at various spots around town.

[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.040]
Now, of course, he has to like zip his lip.

[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.720]
798 votes in our pool yesterday.

[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.000]
What do you think a Niels knew

[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.120]
to want comedy bits are?

[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.400]
Well, it's something we started back in September

[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.580]
on the anniversary of 9-11.

[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.320]
And we've been doing that every Wednesday

[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.020]
from noon to one.

[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.860]
It's opposed to like, you know, I don't know.

[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.140]
I don't know.

[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.080]
Just in the middle of the week.

[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.260]
It's just a nice break.

[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.660]
314 people said, I love it.

[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.060]
That's 39.3%.

[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.740]
It's okay.

[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.700]
254, 31.8%.

[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.100]
So that's 71.1%.

[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.700]
We do like it or they love it or they're embracing it

[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.380]
or they're just waiting with baited breath.

[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.700]
So we'll be doing it again today.

[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.680]
It's a waste of time, 119, 14.9%.

[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.780]
And I hate it.

[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.440]
BAH!

[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.980]
111, 13.9% said that.

[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.640]
It makes me so mad when I hear that.

[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.980]
I want to go out and kill some people.

[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.440]
Yeah, but at any rate, too bad.

[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.440]
Because we're going to do it again today, noon to one.

[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.320]
And see, that will replay the audio of the debate

[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.520]
between McBride and Jeff Bush.

[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.020]
What do you think?

[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.680]
Now, I think we'll stick with the comedy bits.

[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.420]
There's 87,000 stories on the sniper.

[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.840]
All sniper all day, by the way.

[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.040]
It is interesting to see.

[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.540]
Look at that.

[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.260]
There's this.

[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.800]
What's being called the most sophisticated and large?

[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.220]
Oh, I already got that bedtime story

[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.200]
about the attack on the internet.

[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.100]
We already got that.

[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.760]
But at any rate,

[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.520]
but isn't this something of breath of fresh air

[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.140]
they're doing other stories than just

[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.560]
all sniper all day?

[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.920]
I think they may begin a little bit of heat in that, you know?

[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.780]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.860]
Catching just a little bit of flak on this all sniper

[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.640]
all day format.

[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.780]
I mean, give it a rest.

[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.440]
It's like all Chris and Aronde all morning, you know?

[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.480]
Chris and Aronde, just give it a little break.

[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.800]
Little variety there.

[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.320]
Bolton, no, did he have the Baltimore Sun?

[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.500]
Has a fairly concise article.

[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.960]
I got a little like, I cut way down.

[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.440]
Okay?

[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.720]
We don't want it to me long bedtime stories.

[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.160]
Also, my good close ball friend, Tom Jicca.

[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.300]
What did I tell you?

[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.940]
Do I have my thumb on it or what?

[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.020]
I don't know.

[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.920]
But didn't for whatever reason,

[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.640]
I guess he was out of touch with what was going on

[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.360]
in local radio market back in the winter book

[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.100]
when we kicked ass.

[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280]
Didn't write a thing about it.

[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.440]
Back in a spring book when we really kicked ass,

[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.560]
surprised a lot of everybody.

[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.840]
He was out busy playing TV review in L.A.

[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.900]
getting wind and dying.

[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.640]
Didn't write about that.

[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.260]
And I said, hey, next time that station has a down book

[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.000]
when we have a really mediocre book,

[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.320]
then Tom Jicca will be here to write his radio column.

[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.120]
And you know what I was?

[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.540]
Absolutely correct.

[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.160]
Had my thumb right on the pulse of it.

[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.760]
But we'll get to a little, Tom, in his piece.

[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.320]
And a bunch of other stuff, including a nice

[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.220]
fact from our friend Linda.

[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.240]
That's for you, Linda.

[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.780]
Thank you.

[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.060]
Baltimore Sun says, after police police

[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.060]
for a telephone dialogue,

[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.360]
the serial sniper is stalking the Washington region

[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.120]
responded yesterday with a different statement.

[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.040]
The killing of daybrake of a bus driver

[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.500]
accompanied by another demanding letter

[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.240]
left for authorities,

[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.920]
less than a mile from where the government began

[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.860]
shooting three weeks ago.

[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.500]
Police answered last night with their longest televised

[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.300]
address to the killer saying it was not electronically

[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.960]
possible to achieve what the sniper demanded of them

[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.040]
and letter left to the south of the Saturday shooting in

[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.760]
Aslan, Virginia, the sniper demanded that

[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.520]
$10 million be wired to a domestic bank account

[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.960]
and threaten further violence, law enforcement sources

[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.040]
have told of Baltimore's son.

[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.660]
Yesterday's multi-page letter left at Aspen Hills Northgate Park

[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.960]
repeated Saturday's demands official said.

[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.500]
We remain open and ready to talk to you about the options

[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.260]
you have mentioned on Camry County Police Chief

[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.500]
Charles A. Moosey, the Mooseman said last night.

[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.440]
It's important we do this while anybody else

[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:34.900]
get in hurt.

[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.940]
Moose then instructed the sniper to call

[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.740]
authorities to get a toll-free number he could use

[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.060]
and offer to set up a post office box to be used for communications

[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.220]
if that would make the sniper feel more comfortable.

[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.420]
Like he's going to come to a

[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.660]
any PO box anywhere that they already pre-designate right.

[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.360]
You've indicated this is more about violence than about violence

[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.200]
the chief said we're waiting to hear from you.

[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.740]
The killer claimed in letters Saturday which had

[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.460]
similarities to another note left by the sniper

[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.540]
that he's unsuccessfully attempted about six time to contact police

[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.060]
only be thwarted by phone lines and by tifters

[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.320]
according to law enforcement sources.

[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.120]
Police have verified some of those calls by checking their logs.

[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.400]
Earlier in the day Moose revealed one reason my police are so desperate

[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.080]
to maintain contact with a killer.

[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.240]
The letter left behind at Saturday shooting he said contain an alarming threat.

[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.880]
Your children are not safe anywhere at any time.

[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.020]
The disclosure of this threat in yesterday is killing further raised

[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.740]
mistakes in the cryptid dialogue taken place between police and the killer

[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.480]
partly over the public airwaves over satisfying the killer's demands.

[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.800]
Those demands mean while I've taken many by surprise

[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.540]
there were many theories about motives of a sniper who's now killed 10 and wounded three

[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.980]
but few expected he was driven by a quest for money.

[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.480]
He had our attention after the first day said one law enforcement official

[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.440]
speaking on condition of course of anonymity.

[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.140]
Why would he ask for money now?

[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.760]
He's playing with him.

[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.340]
That's why he's asking for money now.

[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.760]
Does he really expect to get the money?

[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.560]
Of course not.

[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.080]
No way.

[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.980]
And the beat goes on.

[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.800]
Only now that we got this kind of uh-oh sniper on the loose.

[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.400]
There we go again.

[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.900]
I thought maybe they had a little bit of a break from that.

[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.160]
But no.

[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.540]
Just a little tiny one.

[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.000]
The sneak in a couple of other brief stories while we get back to all sniper all day.

[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.180]
While we get everybody into a state of total frenzy.

[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.040]
Larry King had a what's his name on last night.

[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.680]
I was watching him between periods of the hockey game.

[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.220]
John Walsh.

[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:12.860]
You see that?

[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.220]
No.

[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.960]
But you were watching still all the way.

[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.340]
I can't believe I had a penalty.

[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.680]
When I'm channel surfing because I feel compelled.

[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.380]
The spirit of this show compels me

[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.700]
from my bedtime stories and whatever else to see who he's got on there and what they're saying.

[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.600]
John Walsh was on there.

[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.400]
Who I like a lot.

[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.020]
I like him.

[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.780]
And he kept pumping his America's most wanted number one 800 uh-uh-what is it?

[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.040]
Crime.

[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:31.940]
I don't know.

[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.000]
1800 is a crime that knows on that show.

[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:35.580]
Is that what it is?

[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:35.960]
I don't know.

[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:36.880]
Something like that.

[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.480]
But in any way he offered that number.

[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.300]
He said they don't trace.

[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.020]
They don't do this.

[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.080]
And we'll see if he calls that number or not.

[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.260]
Ten minutes after nine at five sixty WQM.

[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.540]
What do we got on the schedule today?

[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.420]
We got Jim Mandage in the studio today.

[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.060]
All right.

[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.020]
Hank Goldberg in the studio today.

[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.120]
How do you like that for all four solid hours?

[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.200]
Unencumbered by any other uh-dreck.

[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.500]
Seven o'clock we got speaking of Dreck Sitco's Panther preview.

[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.500]
Seven thirty the Panthers to play the Make Believes in Toronto.

[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:03.200]
Oh.

[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.940]
The pressure is mounting man.

[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.620]

[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.240]

[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.200]
I could sleep tonight.

[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.440]
Not the most night.

Get off.

[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.920]
You ain't seen nothing yet.

[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.700]
You ain't seen nothing yet.

They like it.

[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.860]
And the people who don't like it, well, good luck to you.

[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:37.700]
Turn over to Russian.

[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.440]
No, no, no.

[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.000]
Then you'll see how much you like those comedy bits.

[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.100]
Justin Timberlake is straight but Pop Rocks is a gay old time.

[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.100]
Somebody fact me this.

[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.960]
Where this came from, I have no idea.

[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.180]
It says,

[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:53.160]
all those pranksters at HX Magazine, HX is the ultra-hypnot all-inclusive free-weekly magazine,

[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.700]
covering gay New York City Nightlife.

[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.860]
Warned its readers that in April 5th,

[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.560]
issue would be loaded with April Fool's jokes.

[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.580]
Is this like the thing we got the other day that was from back in February?

[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.940]
A little bit like dated maybe?

[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.000]
Or maybe they just decided to fact this because we had to just

[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.040]
and Tinkerbell update yesterday with what's your name?

[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:09.520]
Probably.

[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.740]
With what's your name?

[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.080]
You guys.

[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:13.520]
I'm a Lano.

[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.000]
Right.

[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:14.440]
There you go.

[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.620]
You got the damn picture right there.

[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.260]
Let's get with it.

[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:16.560]
Well, yeah.

[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.240]
Trying to separate the true from the,

[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.780]
is this true was part of the fun.

[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:25.140]
In its weekly listings, HX declared that April 4th will be just in Timberlake's official

[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.120]
coming-out party at Pop Rocks, the ultra-fun

[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.440]
Thursday night 18 and over gay hotspot.

[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.600]
According to the magazine,

[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.260]
Justin left his girlfriend Britney Spears because he's one of ours.

[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.480]
Oh, I sure hope not.

[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.440]
Bye bye bye!

[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.200]
Oh God, and to celebrate Justin vowed to make out with every cute boy at the club that night.

[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.420]
Whoa, all right, all right.

[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.080]
I know they're currently here at 1-5th of N-Sync coming out of the closet.

[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.280]
Is every gay guy's fantasy?

[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:45.820]
It is.

[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:46.560]
It is.

[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.400]
Oh, after reading that, I want to puke my guts out.

[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.640]
Whoever faxed me that boy,

[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.000]
gets it.

[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.180]
They're these wonderful things called glasses, man.

[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.000]
They're these very talented people called optometrist and optomologists.

[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.880]
Go see one before it's too late and-

[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.640]
Bye bye bye!

[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.380]
Get out of here.

[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.980]
Before we get to Little Tommy Jicke,

[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.600]
which I can't wait to get to that column.

[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.700]
Because just like we told you,

[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.220]
you've also been saying the same thing for a very long time.

[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.820]
That as soon as we had a down book,

[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.020]
Tom would have all of a sudden he'd be right here in town and right in about radio.

[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.300]
And you know, this is the first thing he's written about radio of any consequences way back in

[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.900]
March when he wrote about all the changes at Q-A-M.

[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:21.360]
Right.

[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.620]
And about my being out of touch in my biggest challenge yet and going off to-

[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.380]
And by the way, we had a very big September, Tom.

[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.360]
I know that comes to the shock.

[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.680]
And as soon as we get those hours by hours from Fat Boy,

[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.040]
we'll be able to tell you just how big.

[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.980]
So it must be in spite of the fact that I'm doing all this-

[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.340]
What is again, periodicals on audio?

[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.120]
On audio.

[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.200]
That's number one.

[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.380]
And number two, the fact that I'm so out of touch most of the year,

[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.240]
because I'm not here.

[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.420]
I'm somewhere else touching it.

[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.280]
Speaking of touching it,

[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.100]
Montcharges in video beating of young daughter

[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.060]
were rained on theft charges.

[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.880]
I already had this, but somebody fasted it and again,

[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.080]
so I'll move it up on my pile,

[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.560]
my pile of bedtime stories.

[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.980]
And the reason being there's one-

[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.420]
there's one sentence in here that just sends me.

[00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:58.820]
I love it.

[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.220]
Lagrange Hediana,

[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.080]
the woman accused of beating your daughter in an incident caught on security video tape

[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.160]
and broadcast nationwide,

[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.320]
was rained on charges of taking fabric from a department store.

[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.420]
Madeline Too Good, 25-unercist or Marguerite Jean-Daly, 31,

[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.180]
appeared at Lagrange Circuit Court in Shackles Monday.

[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.060]
That's the part I like.

[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.220]
In Shackles.

[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.300]
Isn't that great?

[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.340]
I love it.

[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.160]
Oh, that picture.

[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.300]
Innocent police in the felony theft charges were entered on their behalf.

[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.320]
They were later released on $3,500 bailage.

[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.120]
Both refused to comment as they left court.

[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.920]
Prosecutors alleged that the sisters took fabric from Yoder's departments.

[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.900]
They were in Chipschewana.

[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:32.700]
Ever been there?

[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.100]
No.

[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.040]
You don't want to go there?

[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:34.740]
Yoder, I've been there.

[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:35.920]
Chipschewana, Indiana?

[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.300]
Woo, and Yodors.

[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.780]
See those Midwestern names,

[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:44.380]
especially those Indiana names, Yoder and Yoko, and whatever they are.

[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.440]
The alleged that sisters took fabric from Yoder's departments store in Chipschewana,

[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.060]
about 35 miles east of South Bend, August 21,

[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.340]
telling her clerk they bought the material days earlier, but forgot to take it home.

[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.820]
That'd be a good pull to do one day.

[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.760]
You know what's the most yahu state in the country?

[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.380]
And it would surprise you, but Indiana is definitely in the running.

[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.020]
Have you ever been Indiana?

[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:03.940]
Yes.

[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.080]
Where boots?

[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:05.880]
I don't know.

[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:06.700]
Passed through by butter.

[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.060]
Oh, and I'm talking about like in it.

[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:08.900]
No, no, no.

[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:09.960]
Who we?

[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.760]
See, when you look at the map, you say to yourself,

[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.280]
while Indiana is not in the deep south,

[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.260]
guess what?

[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:15.920]
Wrong!

[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:16.960]
Wrong.

[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.900]
We went through Indianapolis.

[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.460]
And when you're like Indianapolis, they have like, uh,

[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.980]
they speak many of them with a heavy sudden draw,

[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.700]
and you think, let me look at that map again and see where I've been now.

[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.520]
In September, police and Mr. Walker released a department store surveillance video that said,

[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.280]
well, too good to do this, and we know that.

[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.200]
But seeing her in shackles along with her sister makes a lot of us very happy,

[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.640]
because she's one of those travelers,

[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.380]
a culture of thieves.

[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.820]
We're not too crazy on the show about Gypsies,

[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.080]
trams, travelers and thieves.

[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.980]
Here's the fact that says, I heard you, uh,

[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.220]
I hope you heard the worst team this morning, someone called it.

[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.600]
Yeah, I did hear that about Geldie.

[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.900]
Yeah, I'm old one ballistic about that.

[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.320]
No sense of humor about anything.

[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.140]
I mean, like I said, Geldie, when we first started playing the song,

[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:00.720]
was out singing.

[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.420]
He loved it.

[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.840]
It brought him some attention.

[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.360]
That was back in days when he was just like a,

[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.680]
a quizzling on that show.

[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.460]
Now that he's a big superstar,

[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.200]
and he's there to try to find the most ego every morning,

[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:10.980]
you know something?

[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.220]
I was, I'm not making this up.

[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.000]
I'm driving to work this morning.

[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.740]
Of course I'm listening.

[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.920]
And I hear the, the isolated shots that are coming,

[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.240]
which I guess I'm the only one who understands them,

[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:20.720]
which is good.

[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:21.900]
It's good that I'm listening, Mo.

[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.840]
You're not wasting your time,

[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.600]
but they have nothing to do with a sports band,

[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.380]
who that's going on.

[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.640]
About well, people who point the finger

[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.000]
should look at the mirror and all that other stuff.

[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.040]
I do look at the mirror when I shave.

[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:30.960]
It's not a pretty sight, Mo.

[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.080]
But at least I got my own here,

[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.300]
not too much of it, a little bit.

[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.840]
But I'm thinking of myself.

[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.840]
Do you realize that Geldie is the only person

[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.680]
who could be doing that rule on that show?

[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:40.940]
The father what I'm saying?

[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.660]
No, I'm thinking.

[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.180]
No, I'm serious about that.

[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.260]
He's the, because he understands that if he says anything

[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.060]
disagreeable in a serious way,

[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.940]
not just joking around,

[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.500]
if he says anything disagreeable in a serious way,

[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.160]
he's out the door.

[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.840]
And so because of the fact he's got a wife and kid now and everything,

[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.940]
you know how that works out?

[00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:57.380]

[00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.080]
Self preservation is what it's all about.

[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.040]
So he just, I mean, he's the only one I think

[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.020]
who could deal with that.

[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.060]
Why does a luxury for people who don't have children?

[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:05.620]
There you go.

[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.180]
And then of course, when we think back to that ugly,

[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.440]
grotesque episode, which really blew this whole

[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.820]
most thing open when he tried behind the scenes,

[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.020]
see it's one thing on the air to put on this business of,

[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:15.900]
well, I'm holier than now.

[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.760]
And I don't do these things.

[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.560]
If that's okay, but when you're behind the scenes

[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.680]
stabbing everybody in the back,

[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.120]
that's the real backstabber.

[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.640]
See, there's such a thing as the front stabber

[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.120]
and then there's the backstabber.

[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.340]
The backstabber does their work behind the scenes.

[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.200]
Trying to get people fired.

[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.320]
And so this one is on professional.

[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.340]
I don't want to want to make calls off the air

[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.440]
to get this one taken off here.

[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.300]
Things like that.

[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.840]
That's the real backstabber.

[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.140]
Think of talking about people with a wife and children,

[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.580]
including one not even a surprise.

[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.140]
Surprise.

[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.740]
There's a button in the oven here, George.

[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.040]
Ah, and try to get somebody like that can.

[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.540]
Just out of peak, just to try to assert himself

[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.160]
and throw his weight around in your body.

[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:51.940]
This has a pot belly.

[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.240]
Just to show that he's going to be the big cheese here.

[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:54.860]
Well, guess what?

[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.880]
I saw these numbers, Mom.

[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:56.920]
Oh, man.

[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:57.720]
Cut the cheese.

[00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.280]
Cut the cheese.

[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.760]
Which he probably did when he heard about the numbers were.

[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.320]
Wait till we get those hour by hours.

[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.700]
Is a fat boy here yet with us?

[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.120]
When he comes tumbling through that door,

[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.220]
then I guess we'll know what it is.

[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.040]
Today's Walker day.

[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.340]
So he'll be waddling over here.

[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.060]
What would he mean by that?

[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:11.780]
He's every other day.

[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.340]
He's on wheels.

[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.520]
Oh, I didn't know that.

[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.560]
Every other day he's in the chair

[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.560]
and I'm a Walker.

[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.140]
Why is that?

[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.960]
To build up his strength.

[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.300]
Right.

[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.160]
Lead into it slowly.

[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.540]
He doesn't walk on it.

[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.580]
He doesn't even waddle on it.

[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.400]
He lung it.

[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.320]
He lurches on the walker.

[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.840]
Because there's so much weight pushing on a Walker

[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.940]
that every step is like a major lurch.

[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.440]
So you should go with the wheelchair and the walker at the same time.

[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.180]
Another train monkey.

[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.380]
Okay, just calm down.

[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.140]
Okay, we'll get to you.

[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.040]
We got a great moped pole today, by the way.

[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:43.060]
Huh?

[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:44.780]
We don't you like today's pole?

[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.060]
We got 11 choices on there.

[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.060]
What are you going to do when you don't have him to beat up?

[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.960]
If those numbers keep on away, they are.

[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.600]
That could be soon.

[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.700]
Anyway, top.

[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.320]
Now, seriously, I mean, he's got to show us something for Christ's.

[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.720]
He's got to throw a number in there soon or later for crying out loud.

[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.180]
Stupid.

[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.300]
Latin radio stations grab half the ratings top 10 rights,

[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.080]
Tom Jicke, who finally writes a

[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:06.980]
radio column.

[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.460]
Oh, we'll even take it even though we had like a mediocre book.

[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.100]
But of course that was because of George and other things.

[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.820]
Well, no, you were still number one.

[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.900]
It's better than being number five, which I see.

[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.520]
It wasn't a good idea for you to remind me that you were number five last time.

[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.620]
I was bringing those numbers out.

[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.680]
I was dusted to that.

[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.940]
They're in budget meetings today to try to see if they can actually give George more money

[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.880]
than Moe because the George has got much higher ratings.

[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:28.300]
Huh?

[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.440]
Well, Linda and her facts that I'll get to in a moment,

[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.480]
she suggests you want to get paid as much or more

[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.140]
because you have a lot higher numbers.

[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.260]
We actually have people listening when you're doing the show,

[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.600]
which I know is shocking, but at any rate, it's true.

[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.820]
I mean, if you had the kind of numbers he had, believe you, me, you'd be out the door.

[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.360]
When I got that precipitous call from Greg Read about,

[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.940]
congratulations on a really good book.

[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.060]
And by the way, I've decided to terminate George right away, guys.

[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.120]
I should have saved that.

[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.060]
I'm a force male up there.

[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:53.980]
I could have saved it.

[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.000]
And found a way to transfer it to tape because that really deserved to be on the ear.

[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.240]
He didn't decide to fire anybody.

[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.340]
He was the pressured muscle by a hysterical tantrum,

[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.580]
by a hysterical silly self-serving old man.

[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.000]
Remember on Howdy-Duty, Mr. Bluster?

[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:10.520]
No.

[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.000]
Mr. Bluster was one of the puppets on Howdy-Duty.

[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.780]
He was like, he was a cantankerous old character.

[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.040]
That's what we got here. Mr. Bluster.

[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.340]
I don't know whether I want to keep calling him more,

[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.880]
or maybe Mr. Bluster, I think would be good,

[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:23.920]
although it kind of dates me.

[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.920]
Just like they were talking this morning when I was coming to work

[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.940]
about the greatest moment in World Series history,

[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.860]
I think the answer beyond a shadow of a doubt,

[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.800]
it all depends on your age.

[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.220]
Beyond a shadow of a doubt is 1956,

[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.420]
Don Larson's perfect game.

[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.320]
That wasn't even mentioned.

[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.700]
And a guy in his 70s like Moe,

[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.300]
I mean, he certainly was around to see that or know about it.

[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.840]
But that wasn't even mentioned.

[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.280]
Anyway, we'll get to Tom Jikers,

[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.560]
Colin will get to Linda's Facts.

[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.860]
We'll get to our poll question,

[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.560]
which Eric is on.

[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:47.900]
Look at that.

[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.080]
He's already got it on there.

[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.900]
So before I even mention the poll for today,

[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.320]
you can go peruse it and cast your vote.

[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.640]
In fact, I'm going to have to think about that one myself,

[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.720]
because there's so many excellent choices on it.

[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.720]
26 past nine at 560 WQM,

[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.480]
as we wait for the moment of truth,

[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.880]
when Fat Boy comes lurching through that door on that walker,

[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.380]
and says, Hey, Pally, here's those hourly numbers.

[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.160]
And you know something, why not happen today?

[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.560]
I was Adam, you know, we like Adam,

[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.220]
but dear, it's disappointing when the door opened

[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.400]
and I thought it was going to be Fat Boy.

[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.220]
What does he say?

[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.460]
He said Jeff can't get him.

[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.040]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.260]
He can't get him.

[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.500]
Arbitroid is not whatever.

[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.880]
He said he can't get the numbers from Arbitroid.

[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.920]
He can't get the numbers from Arbitroid.

[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.180]
Well, what about Little Maddie Bell?

[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.160]
He's our last white grade hope, I guess.

[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.400]
Go find Little Maddie Bell and kick him around a little bit.

[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.020]
That won't be tough.

[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.460]
And be like kicking a soccer ball.

[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.840]
So Fat Boy, let's us down.

[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.780]
I say keep his ass off that plane, you know?

[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.100]
They've got the whole first row and first class reserve for a Fat Boy.

[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:48.780]
Both Isles.

[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.560]
How you going to get the nose up if he's up in first class?

[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.200]
Like I said, back in cargo.

[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.120]
So we can't get it for us.

[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.260]
And here's a guy that always talks a big game.

[00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.480]
You know, I probably will do this.

[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.520]
And by the way, you know, I did watch some of that game last night,

[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.900]
quite a bit of the Sabers Beat Philadelphia.

[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:04.800]
It was a great gamer.

[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.740]
Genre was at his best.

[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.300]
There was nobody there in Buffalo.

[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:08.780]
Great rivalry.

[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.460]
Both teams, how does it pistol?

[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:11.800]
There was nobody there.

[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.780]
It looked like it was worse than a Panther game.

[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:15.900]
What's going on, eh?

[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.980]
Because I noticed a lot of sucking up to the Marlins now,

[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.760]
which I heard this morning, which is really embarrassing.

[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.260]
And David Samson, etc.

[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.000]
That little midget.

[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.820]
But the fact of the matter is no matter how you slice it,

[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.720]
crow and moe, nobody cares.

[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.060]
They can market this and market that into a big saw in a dance.

[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.680]
Now that they know they're going to have to probably be here

[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.360]
another four years.

[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.080]
Uh, it ain't going to make any difference.

[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:35.820]
There's no interest.

[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.280]
No interest.

[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.060]
But you keep banging away on it, baby.

[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.600]
927 at 560.

[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.980]
That was some very depressing news now.

[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.160]
Now we got to cut out Maddie Bell.

[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.160]
And you know Maddie's.

[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.060]
He's kind of unpredictable.

[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.400]
Especially after things you've been sent about.

[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:50.800]
He's never failed us.

[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.640]
Hey, if you love your home, but you need more space,

[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.560]
maybe there's like an unwanted baby showed up.

[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.400]
I mean, an unexpected.

[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.780]
Do what hundreds of other smart people like George

[00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.140]
are doing cost-wreckly additions.

[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.020]
Whether you're having that, uh, not, uh,

[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.060]
that baby wanted or not in the other room.

[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.280]
If you're converting a car porter patio in living space,

[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.520]
maybe you went into business for yourself

[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.380]
on a make-home office.

[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.300]
Call the experts at strictly additions

[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.540]
because they'll do a stupendous and beatable job for you.

[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.120]
There you're one stop, shop, more space for your place,

[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:15.360]
place with an absolutely,

[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.600]
positively worry-free approach to expanding your living space.

[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.500]
Forget about no shows by other guys.

[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.900]
We're never going to happen when you call strictly additions.

[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.240]
In complete work, no chance.

[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.200]
No unexpected bills.

[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.600]
No worries about the job not getting done right or finished.

[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.740]
And they take care of every last detail.

[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.120]
They drop your blueprints.

[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.380]
They get the building permits, handle all the inspections for you.

[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.580]
And of course, they've got that easy five step approach

[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.800]
to total customer satisfaction.

[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.060]
First, they call the schedule a free project

[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.320]
evaluation implement at your home,

[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.300]
where a project estimated determines the scope

[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.820]
of your addition, what you'll be needing.

[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.880]
Second, they schedule a bit of employment in their convenience

[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.300]
room, where you'll get a detailed proposal

[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.560]
and an exact price for the work.

[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.820]
Third, select your finishing touches, go to contract

[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.140]
fourth, review the design, architectural drawings,

[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.460]
and fifth, the highlight.

[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.760]
You sit back and relax on your fat asses,

[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:57.800]
your dream addition moves ahead

[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.640]
on schedule with unbeatable quality.

[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:00.780]
It's a piece of cake.

[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:01.900]
Cake?

[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.440]
Cost strictly additions at 9.5.4.791.8100.

[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:06.900]
How come a diabetic like Michael

[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.880]
who keeps going to diabetic comas is talk-edin cake?

[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.500]
I still wanted that from Godfather 3.

[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.100]
Maybe they know with strictly additions.

[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:13.840]
Ask them when you call.

[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.560]
7.919.8100.

[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.840]
You can check out the random yellow pages.

[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.240]
They serve all of Broward and all of South Palm Beach County too.

[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.540]
They are licensed and shared professionals who do a

[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.680]
stupendous job for you, like they did for George.

[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.500]
Call 9.5.4.719.8100.

[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.880]
For strictly additions.

[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.600]
Why?

[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.260]
Why and look all high?

[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.280]
We're sports video 560s.

[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:32.620]
You ain't.

[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]
You ain't.

[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:34.820]
Yo, yo.

[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.440]
Let's rate four.

[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.320]
Ready.

[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:38.900]
Yo, big shot.

[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.480]
Her guess how we pass the time away

[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.700]
in the Galeo Jailer.

[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.280]
Oh.

[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:45.920]
Oh.

[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:48.640]
Santana.

[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.800]
You've heard him play his Grammy performance with Rob Thomas.

[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.560]
And on the latest hit with Michelle Branch.

[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.780]
Everybody wants Santana on their song.

[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.340]
So we've compiled a city collection of every artist Santana has ever played with.

[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.860]
Like M&M.

[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.260]
Two spread apart girls go round the outside.

[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.460]
Round the outside.

[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.400]
Round the outside.

[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.140]
Good.

[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:16.420]
Good.

[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:16.420]

[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:16.420]

[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:16.420]

[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.080]
Dixie chicks.

[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.080]
I bet you're right.

[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:19.740]
I bet you're right.

[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:22.240]
Good.

[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.080]
Good.

[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:27.760]
Andrea Bacheli.

[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:28.560]
Good.

[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.420]
Good.

[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:31.420]

[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:32.740]
Good.

[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:40.320]
It's Santana's looks for everyone CD including unreleased tracks from Carlos and.

[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.900]
John Tash with some day your journey will end.

[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.620]
I'll be there for you as well.

[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.740]
Yes, he's a guitar playing whore who will play with anybody.

[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.200]
It's that of course Kelly Clarkson.

[00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.400]
No way man.

[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.920]
Santana's licks for everyone order now and receive a personalized bonus track where

[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.480]
Santana plays your very own birthday song.

[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.840]
Happy birthday dear Santana.

[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.360]
Call now.

[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.140]
I'm 33 at 560 WQM happy Wednesday to it.

[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:16.820]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.520]
I think we might break some records with our poll week to our result today.

[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.500]
They like these kinds of polls.

[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.840]
I guess I better give you the poll.

[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.220]
34 votes on our already having read the goddamn poll question yet.

[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:28.760]
11 choices.

[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.440]
The reason Mojauer David's ratings are so weak is.

[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:33.740]
He's boring.

[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.400]
I don't know.

[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.300]
I only listen to Neil.

[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.540]
I don't know.

[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.420]
I don't listen to him which see the reason I did those separate ones because there are people

[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.260]
listening to the mad dog or hank or other parts of the station but don't listen to morning.

[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:44.980]
The only is too squeaky.

[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.320]
He's a pompous ass.

[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:47.880]
Bracket him.

[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:49.400]
He show blows.

[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.480]
The beast booked bad guests.

[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.160]
He's alienated everybody else's audience.

[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.080]
Because unfortunately his show never sounded better.

[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.440]
I love Mo or who's Mojauer David.

[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.200]
Those are your 11 choices on there.

[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.100]
What do we got so far?

[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.260]
34 votes.

[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.100]
8 say he's a pompous ass.

[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.200]
6 say I don't know.

[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.060]
I don't listen to Neil.

[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.440]
5 say his show blows.

[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.120]
4 say I love Mo.

[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.100]
Y'all these two squeaky 3.

[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.000]
I don't know.

[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:14.620]
I don't listen to him.

[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:14.920]
3.

[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.380]
Who's Mojauer David 2.

[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.280]
He's alienated everybody else's audience.

[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.860]
1 because unfortunately his show has never sounded better.

[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:21.720]
1 he's boring.

[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.340]
1 in the book.

[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.920]
A beast book bad guest has gotten on.

[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:28.860]
The beast has gotten no votes in terms of being the scapegoat for the week numbers in the morning.

[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.960]
There's Miguel who's got those hourly numbers for us.

[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.740]
Where's Maddie Bell?

[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.320]
Have you seen little Maddie running around a building?

[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.760]
He's in the building I was told.

[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:36.540]
He isn't a building.

[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:41.000]
OK, that's our project now between now 1 o'clock is to grab Maddie Bell by the Toes,

[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:41.780]
which shouldn't be hard.

[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.060]
They're right below his armpits.

[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.500]
And carry him over to that computer and get him working on that stuff.

[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.320]
Maybe they're not going to be available till tomorrow,

[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.480]
which would be bad because tomorrow the sales department's going to be all gone.

[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.920]
And Maddie and his crew will be in their budget meetings.

[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.140]
But the good news is muffin clearance will be back tomorrow.

[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.620]
Now clearance, but muff could get onto it.

[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:02.300]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.360]
He might hop on it.

[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.060]
So Tom Jikker writes Latin radio stations grab half of the ratings top 10.

[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.800]
Didn't I tell you this when the ratings came out?

[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:09.940]
Shrows and spows, baby.

[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:13.760]
This summer because all the non-latent whites get out of here in the summertime.

[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.380]
Don't you spicks go away in the summer?

[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.160]
Well, of course you can't.

[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.460]
Miguel, he can't do that.

[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:17.980]
Huh?

[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.200]
No, he couldn't because he was working here for free while I was in Toronto.

[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:21.940]
I have a great time.

[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.700]
Yeah, so the spicks don't go anywhere.

[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.360]
They like it here.

[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.220]
Of course, they're probably not wanted in any place else.

[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.560]
And then the schwarzers, they can't afford to get out of town.

[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:30.720]
Right?

[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:32.780]
Where are they going to go?

[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.560]
They're certainly not going to cross the state line and go up into Georgia.

[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.680]
They'll be picking cotton in a half an hour if they go up there.

[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.400]
So they're going to stay here where they'll be safe, you know, or at least then whatever.

[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.720]
So we had spows and spows because everybody else was out of town.

[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.480]
Which time points out at the very end of this article?

[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.940]
Let's read the article a little Tommy Jikker's column.

[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.860]
They in which he actually doesn't take a shot at me or the show or about periodical on,

[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.600]
I can't remember the line.

[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:55.940]
Periodical on audio.

[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.620]
On audio.

[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.320]
For some strange reason, I have a like a brain fart on that.

[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:00.940]
I can't remember it.

[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.620]
He says Latin radio stations grab half a rating's top 10.

[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.060]
The sounds of summer on South Florida radio this year were heavily in Esponial.

[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:07.980]
How do you like that?

[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:08.400]
Thank you.

[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:08.500]

[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:08.940]
Yeah.

[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.280]
Spanish language stations captured half of the birds in the markets, top 10.

[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.220]
According to Arbitron's quarterly audience survey conducted from mid June through mid-September.

[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:22.060]
Despite the search for Latin radio, WEDR, the urban contemporary music outlet,

[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:27.320]
best known as 99 Jammed, maintained its distinction as the market's most listened new station.

[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.780]
You can't, what do I tell you?

[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:29.600]
You can't beat them.

[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.480]
Shfarts is with a stick.

[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.380]
99 Jammed's dominance is complete.

[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.020]
It's the highest rated station in the catch-all category of listeners.

[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.600]
12 plus 6 am to midnight.

[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.480]
Also tops among 25 to 54 year olds of so-called money demographic because it is the one

[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.380]
that avoids the majority of advertising be sold.

[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:45.780]
Power 96.

[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:46.440]
Oh!

[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.820]
Let me ask you something first.

[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.080]
What's that crap they played on the hall?

[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:51.180]
WPOW.

[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.060]
Power 96 held onto the number two position in head in the spring book among the overall audience.

[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.800]
Latent's to end by the way, their number went way back up again.

[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.620]
I just mentioned that from my Disney and Casey's list and the party's over, baby.

[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.960]
Power's kicking your ass because they put that Albee silk on there.

[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.380]
And they sent that Schwo Gryffit back off to the psychic network for training.

[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.440]
Latent stations occupied the next three positions which shows you again it was a heavily spoked book.

[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:13.800]
WRMA.

[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.040]
Radio Romancea.

[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.800]
FM106 jumped up from ninth in the spring book to take third.

[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:18.720]
Anybody believe that?

[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:18.960]
No.

[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:19.240]
No.

[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:27.640]
Just ahead of WAMR, Radio Amor FM107 which improved from number six, Spanish talk WQI,

[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.060]
claimed the station to be in the market's highest rated AM station, finishing in a three-way

[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.760]
tie for fifth with hot and life.

[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.360]
So other than life which is slush music, you got all your top stations that are either

[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.220]
Schwo were spoke, black or spick.

[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.800]
I mean that's what does that say?

[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.700]
Two additional Latent stations WCMQ and WRTO radio ritmo followed in eighth and ninth.

[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.160]
So you look at the top ten here, man, and you don't have any white people, you know?

[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.720]
You don't have any whiteies.

[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.440]
You got a bunch of goddamn banana boat people and you got the, you know,

[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.720]
the watermelon shoppers out there.

[00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.300]
That's all you got.

[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.500]
Did any white people get diaries?

[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:02.780]
No.

[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.460]
Evidently not.

[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.820]
How do we do so good in September?

[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:06.900]
Well, we got a few spicks.

[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:07.560]
You came back.

[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.540]
And I came back.

[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.220]
That's where I came back to be a little George out.

[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.020]
Who reminds me he finished fifth in men last summer?

[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.120]
That, you know, the more I think about that, the more I think Momei have had a point.

[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.140]
I mean that's not good.

[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:18.900]
You know, it's not good.

[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.300]
Fifth in men on this show.

[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:26.060]
W-I-O-D-A-M-6-10, which tied for 12th of the highest rated English A-M station.

[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.920]
What a, and that's really something that we're going to have to like worry about.

[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.340]
W-I-O-D-O-I hate that station.

[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:36.300]
A home of Dr. Laura Rush Limbo on Phil Henry finished eight places ahead of mostly sports WQ-A-M.

[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:36.780]
Are you sure?

[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.600]
Which suffered from the annual Summer Absence of Neal Rogers and further slippage of its morning drive program.

[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:42.340]
Uh-oh!

[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.200]
Sounds like a shot at Mo!

[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.360]
WQ-A-M had hoped the hiring of Howard David, who has a,

[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.440]
David had, who has a national profile as well, being the new voice of the dolphins,

[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.660]
might bring new listeners to the morning show.

[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:54.540]
We had hoped for that.

[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.520]
But unfortunately, uh, it don't seem to be working out for some strange reason.

[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:00.420]
Hello, George.

[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:02.480]
Hey, don't suck up the hand now.

[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:03.460]
He ain't going to cover for you.

[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.560]
We don't lie about the numbers on this show.

[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.540]
Whether they're good, bad or indifferent, we just give them right out.

[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.200]
We don't make them up.

[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.660]
WQ-A-M even slumped in its target demographic,

[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.600]
men 25 to 54, losing about 20% of its overall audience,

[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:18.080]
and a slightly higher percentage in morning drive rights time,

[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.020]
who's taken another little shot at Mo.

[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.460]
Jesus Christ, the good news for WQ-A-M is that the markets

[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.000]
other sports station, and by the way,

[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.460]
Jim Sarni or an idiot, okay, have somebody read you the numbers.

[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.640]
Have Tommy explain the artwork.

[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.060]
Remember, Jim Sarni wrote a thing a few Fridays ago about how in the last trend,

[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.660]
the morning they were like moving in on Howard?

[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.280]
I don't want to stand up for Howard because that would be out of character for me,

[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.100]
and I just can't do it.

[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.620]
But it's not a contest.

[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:45.320]
They had a 0.9 in the mornings in 2554 men.

[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.640]
So, Tom says the good news for Q-M is the markets other sports station,

[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.120]
W-R-F-X Fox, barely registered in the book, finishing in the tie,

[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.100]
for 30 second overall audience among 34 stations.

[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.720]
30 second out of 34th, and tied for 30 second, not even by a loan.

[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.980]
The only station right below W-R-F X is W-K-A-T,

[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.200]
which with nothing to lose, recently switched to classical music,

[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.320]
classical gas.

[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.720]
The results of that formal change won't show up until the fall book released to the end of this year.

[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.000]
Spanish stations also had a strong showing the 25 to 54 breakout.

[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.760]
W-R-M A tied with hot for a second behind EDR with

[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.680]
Radio Ritmo in 4th, live at English language soft music,

[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.680]
Slash Station was next, followed by CMQ Radio Amortai,

[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.420]
Bayba-Baba-Baba.

[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.780]
The summer book is generally considered the least important of our Bertrand surveys because

[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:32.500]
listening is a typical as a result of occasions both of talent and listeners.

[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:33.680]
Says Tom Jica.

[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:34.800]
Excellent column, Tom.

[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:40.180]
Even though you wrote it after we predicted, we took a little bit of a

[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:44.020]
precipitous dump on this station, and you failed a phone out though that we were still number one in midday.

[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:45.740]
In the summertime, you did it.

[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.520]
It was, George sucked wind, but nevertheless we were still number one.

[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:52.180]
With over a six, whatever it's going to be, if we ever get Maddie Bell to get us those numbers.

[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.360]
You know something, this is going to be quite a project this time, getting these hour by hour.

[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.840]
And don't think that anybody is hiding it because, believe me, most of the people in this building

[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.740]
are salivating just waiting to see those hour by hour numbers.

[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.080]
They just can't wait to see.

[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:04.680]
Jesus Christ.

[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.160]
The nine numbers are hour by hour and see if they're really as bad as Neil says they are.

[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:09.560]
You know?

[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.400]
I mean, you can pontificate all you want and you lean up there against the back wall and dream of those

[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.920]
good old days when you were a big superstar.

[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.200]
It ain't happening here, Mo.

[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:16.980]
You know?

[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.560]
In fact, leading the way his apompass ass has got 22 votes.

[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.920]
I just see, with the 11 choices on there, I don't have time.

[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.740]
I don't have the luxury of time to go down the whole list every day.

[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.200]
No, seriously, that would take us all the way up to noon in those comedy bits.

[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:29.880]
All right.

[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:30.740]
Not a bad idea.

[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:34.220]
Hey, let me tell you now that summertime is over and we're serious.

[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:38.740]
Those summer vacations and all that slack in office concern, get the weight off with balance for life.

[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.580]
This is the way to do it.

[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:40.800]
They bring in that little black sack.

[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.160]
George has got his sack right over there.

[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.340]
Look at that.

[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.560]
The fact which has got his sack.

[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.940]
And at any rate, you can lose a ton of weight, the easy, delicious way because they use it.

[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.440]
You know, yesterday, one of my entrees I had, there was a nice,

[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.100]
fresh plum and some blueberries in there.

[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.960]
You know, what do they cause it like when you buy strawberries and the stores at a pint,

[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.140]
they call them and you buy the little lady?

[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.420]
What do you mean you have no idea?

[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.080]
Haven't you ever bought produce?

[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.160]
Sure, I've got a pint.

[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.120]
A little thing.

[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.180]
I think they call it a pint.

[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.520]
Well, whatever they call it, when you buy produce in any market, even the good markets,

[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:13.160]
you go through and on top, they put all the real good fresh ones on top.

[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:18.620]
So it looks good and you go down in the middle of it and you get the ones that are spoiled and worms and squashed and black.

[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.300]
You look at the produce from balance for life that's in your,

[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.080]
whether you're on trays and all that other good stuff and you just amazed at the quality.

[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.280]
Like all the other stuff too.

[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.900]
They use only the best ingredients for preparing your food for you based on the principles of the

[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.520]

And they let you choose between two choices for every meal, two every day that you're on a program.

[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.200]

[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:10.440]
My life and locals, this is 430-564.

[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:11.800]
You weigh a million.

[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.840]
The more on hour at nine o'clock you'll hear more.

[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.340]
In theater sound, I don't even have any ideas who just guy is.

[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.080]
From the director of Red Dragon.

[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.240]
I am not a man.

[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.360]
Barney, the dinosaur stars in.

[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.480]
It's a dinosaur.

[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.000]
Purple Dragon.

[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.820]
I'll staple your eye just to your forehead.

[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.940]
Oh, boy, boy, can't wait.

[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.000]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]
Open your eyes.

[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.620]
Oh, that's so much fun.

[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.900]
There's the fun in that.

[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:38.960]
Purple Dragon.

[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.540]
Now I am becoming more for the man.

[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.720]
I'm sure you are.

[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.360]
And we're all very special.

[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.260]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.340]
In theaters everywhere.

[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.420]
If you enjoy it.

[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.840]
My bottle was top and front.

[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:51.900]
It was like you too.

[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.820]
Was Barney saying Moe?

[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:54.340]
Was that what you said?

[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:54.640]
No.

[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.380]
946-560-WQA.

[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:57.620]
I'm sorry.

[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.140]
Whether one at the packet, I mean the queen that facts me the thing about Justin Tinkerbell.

[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.580]
Just go away sweetheart.

[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.620]
Bye, bye, bye.

[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.260]
Obviously whipped up to a frenzy today.

[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.480]
He's probably got his Moe blow up now.

[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.280]
There now he sends me a whole thing about anal sex.

[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.740]
We ought to save this for Georgia, I guess.

[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.940]
For the next time, George Tiffilin.

[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.720]
I'm not ashamed to say I've always been intrigued by anal sexes or this effect.

[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:17.800]
So I'll save this for you.

[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.140]
I'll put it at the bottom of my piles.

[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.600]
So Linda, thank you Linda.

[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:22.800]
There's another kiss for you.

[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:23.340]
North to charge.

[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.200]
I should give the promo here for Miguel.

[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.120]
Look for the cue.

[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:28.860]
We can't get those hour by hours yet.

[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.080]
Maddie Bell is working on it.

[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.500]
Okay, he's got his nose to the grindstone.

[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.100]
And we might have to wait till tomorrow, you think?

[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.040]
We can drag this thing out for days and weeks now.

[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.200]
The suspense man.

[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:39.920]
Wow!

[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.940]
It is penetrating.

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.600]
Inquiring minds want to know out there.

[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.100]
I was my poll okay here.

[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.260]
Did Eric have some kind of a brain fart on the pool?

[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.640]
Because I noticed the thing at the bottom is like, uh, yeah.

[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.740]
There's like something happened on the bottom of my home page there.

[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.020]
108 votes already?

[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.260]
That's shocking.

[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:02.000]
The reason Moe Howard David did this ratings there so weak is he's a pompous ass 29.

[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:02.720]
I don't know.

[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.160]
I literally listen to Neil 24.

[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.980]
Who's Moe Howard David did 15?

[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.580]
He showed blows 12.

[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:08.780]
I love Moe 7.

[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:09.760]
I don't know.

[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:10.660]
I don't listen to Moe 6.

[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.200]
Geldies 2 squeaky 4.

[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.200]
Because unfortunately his show has never sounded better 3.

[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.740]
He's alienated everybody else's audience 3.

[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.500]
The beast book bad guest 2.

[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.140]
And he's boring 1.

[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.380]
But there's something like at the bottom.

[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.020]
There's another category there that's missing.

[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.240]
What's the other category George?

[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.200]
I don't know what it is.

[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.640]
Look for the kill him.

[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.280]
Who's Howard David?

[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.940]
At least that's how you wrote it out.

[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.000]
It's third 15 votes.

[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:36.800]
You better get with him Mr.

[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:37.760]
you should don't know your poll.

[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.460]
Look for the Q&A van today from Noon2 with the Amico.

[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.400]
Look and I was at Amico or BP Amico.

[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:44.760]
Whatever.

[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.040]
You don't this.

[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:51.380]
At the Amico at 3401 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami 34th and Biscayne.

[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.940]
Boy Miguel ought to get lucky down there.

[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.540]
Stop by to win prizes and register to win a trip for 2 to see the dolphins play the Jets in New York.

[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.760]
So we have some crappy prizes but a chance to win a really great trip.

[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.760]
So there you go go buy and see Miguel keep him company.

[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.700]
Keep him safe from all those undesirables.

[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.180]
They're at 34th and Biscayne.

[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.200]
Because we know what's going on down there.

[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:09.860]
Mom maybe not.

[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.840]
Hey by the way the guy with the anal sex thing.

[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:12.640]
Bye bye bye.

[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.220]
Have a great life with the tinkerbell.

[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.080]
So Linda sends me this fact she says,

[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:19.400]
Hi Neil my husband and I just mailed in our Arbatron radio diaries this week.

[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.240]
Of course we can't make any comment on that.

[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:26.980]
We both listen to Moe for an hour and a half every, I would not say an hour or half an hour every weekday.

[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.520]
We're only listening to catch his latest inane remarks about you or others at the station.

[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.100]
He must be a very stupid person to wage a war with you.

[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.980]
It only makes him appear more obnoxious and unprofessional than the extreme.

[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:40.160]
You don't have to know the guy to be able to tell what a painting must be to work with or to be around.

[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.740]
Says Linda she don't even work here and she knows it.

[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.080]
And knows that he tried to get poor little George fired.

[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:51.120]
At the worst possible time of his life when he just his wife just gave birth to that surprise baby.

[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:56.640]
Also Linda says I think George should be paid as much as how it since his numbers are higher and she's got a good point.

[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:57.980]
Absolutely correct.

[00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:58.620]
Ma'am.

[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.740]
After all what else matters on the radio.

[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:01.400]
George is great.

[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.120]
My only complaint with him was when he was treaching his wife all the time.

[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.960]
Rick Riley used to do that I think it sucks.

[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.160]
It would be okay if his wife had equal time on here.

[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.880]
Well guess what's starting next Monday morning.

[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.780]
Crystal Rodriguez on here next Monday morning six to nine.

[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:14.660]
Huh?

[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:15.960]
She would love it.

[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.180]
It says I too miss Timmy a lot.

[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.940]
I think the show suffers from his loss but I still love the show what we're today.

[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.400]
He's talking of course about passions.

[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.640]
I can't believe I'm a small girl last night.

[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:25.960]
What is wrong with me?

[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:26.620]
I was in the first place.

[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:27.740]
Pretty good hockey game.

[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.460]
Huh no flesh.

[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.480]
When do we ever see flesh?

[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.020]
That big hug.

[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:35.340]
Other than that one episode there with the sweat where everybody's a season.

[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:38.440]
Yeah right and that was oh that's right when the teacher was uh yeah.

[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.280]
Thank you for the quality show that amuses and informs us.

[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:42.820]
Linda keep reading those bedtime stories.

[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.460]
Thank you sweetheart.

[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.940]
We love you.

[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:49.320]
Bloomberg's boycott opens door for another parade controversy.

[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.800]
Poor old Mike.

[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.920]
This is from the A&P.

[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.000]
Get ready for another parade controversy.

[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.960]
It was only earlier this month that Mayor Michael Bloomberg

[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.020]
bought out of the Columbus Day parade in favor of a very large very public.

[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:03.920]
It's had in lunch with cast members of these sopranos after organizers

[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:05.520]
objected to his marching with them.

[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.060]
Now almost before the mayor had time to digest his penne

[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:11.600]
he's mixed up with the St. Patridge Day parade and gays.

[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.280]
Gays.

[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:13.300]
That's a guest.

[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.700]
Gays maybe that guy that was sending me the thing about Justin Tinkerbell.

[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.640]
Bye bye bye.

[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.740]
He's gonna be bearing his ass on St. Patty's day.

[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.120]
Sounds to me like he bears it just about every day.

[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.020]
The parade organized by the ancient order of the high birions

[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:29.020]
allows gays and lesbians to march but not to identify themselves with a banner

[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.840]
as representing a gays or lesbian organization.

[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:33.020]
Right.

[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:34.620]
How do you like that?

[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.580]
Asked about it during the Columbus Day controversy,

[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.600]
Bloomberg said he would march down Fifth Avenue for the St. Patys Day parade

[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.780]
as well as had an inclusive parade in Queens.

[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:42.940]
Queens.

[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:47.120]
He said he would also invite gays and lesbians to an annual St. Patys Day breakfast.

[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.560]
He hosts at Grace Mansion.

[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.400]
He's in the last year.

[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.400]
You know the rest of the world keeps laughing at us.

[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.460]
I hate to break the news to you boys and girls.

[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.280]
The rest of the world keeps laughing at the USA.

[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.020]
That this kind of crap still goes on.

[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.020]
On one hand they're laughing on the other hand they're scared

[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.080]
crap was because of all the guy named Guns.

[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.340]
Crazy people with guns.

[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.160]
And as you travel around the world you realize this is one of the very very very

[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.940]
few countries in the world where you have all these crazy people with guns

[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.800]
and people in places like major metropolitan areas like Washington DC

[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.360]
are afraid to let their kids go out of the house or even walk

[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.420]
go get gassed or do anything because they're afraid some lunatic that's

[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.740]
unluced is gonna blow their crap away.

[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.500]
The more Bloomberg was asked the less he seemed comfortable with that position

[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.920]
earlier this week he finally suggested he may not march at all on St. Patys Day.

[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.460]
I don't think that any of the censorship or discrimination makes any sense Bloomberg said

[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:37.280]
Monday but if the parade organizers found whoever I choose to invite next March on acceptable

[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.320]
I go have dinner in an Irish pub instead of an Italian restaurant.

[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.480]
Good for him.

[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.240]
He added who I'm going to invite I don't know I hope the organizers find whoever's chosen is acceptable.

[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.600]
Parade Director James Barker is stoked to controversy

[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.740]
hinting that organizers may object if Bloomberg invites the wrong guests like if there's

[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.060]
maybe too many priests in the parade would be bad I would think.

[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:01.600]
If the mayor wants to go to an Irish pub said Barker that's his right there's nothing to

[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.200]
answer now because we don't know who he's inviting.

[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.680]
The parade is one court decisions that back its prohibiting against the Irish lesbian

[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:10.520]
and gay organization from marching under its banner in the parade for the past 11 years.

[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.940]
Bloomberg's apparent and what about them little elves huh those elves and ferries?

[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:21.060]
Bloomberg's apparent reconsideration of a stance could be the result of a campaign led by some

[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.120]
of the city's most prominent gay and lesbians during the past several days.

[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.900]
State Senator Tom Duane City Councilwoman Christine Quinn and members of the Irish lesbian and

[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.620]
gay organization have written letters of protest to the mayor and on Monday a few hours before

[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:37.060]
the mayor publicly considered his decision to march they held a press conference in city hall

[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:40.160]
to denounce Bloomberg Bloomberg whatever it holds name is this week.

[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:45.300]
The St. Patrick's Day parade is a long troubling history of discriminating against the lesbian

[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.480]
gay bisexual transgender community Quinn said at the press conference.

[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.160]
Blayer Bloomberg's decision to march on these same patties they parade validates discrimination

[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.720]
and exclusion and denies the very essence of this city on Tuesday Quinn said the pressure may

[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.260]
have gotten them here to rethink the his position like prone.

[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:03.120]
Well I'd like to think that my letters in the press conference have led him to reconsider said

[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:08.540]
Quinn's position has seemed to soften a little bit we bit. Bloomberg spokesman Ed Scholler said

[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:12.220]
what the mayor wants most is to avoid a repeat of the Columbus Day hoopla the parade is a long

[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:16.740]
way off said Scholler nobody wants to repeatedly last parade of that debacle is what he said.

[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.540]
Well the votes are pouring in on this very important pool here baby they're pouring in you notice that

[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:34.060]
what do we got 7000 already 138 already the reason Moe Howard David and his ratings are so

[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:38.500]
weak is he's a pompous ass 40 I don't know I won't listen to Neil 32 and it goes from there who's

[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:43.460]
Moe Howard David 17 we're trying to give a lot of publicity on the show and like his buddy fish said

[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:49.040]
he couldn't buy it for 50 million dollars and fish you are absolutely correct I mean it's not as good

[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:54.140]
as effective as those billboards that Greg read his poem huh see the reason we don't have any billboards

[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:57.900]
is because cheap channel loans all the billboards that's why you see all the IOD billboards and for all

[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:02.060]
the cheap channel 400 stations in the market this is because they own all the goddamn billboards and

[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:07.340]
are we gonna pay for them no way now how about the TV spots did that campaign hasn't I kicked in yet

[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:14.820]
and the big newspaper ads they've done the job no attack on internet called the largest ever you

[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:18.820]
wear that this just happened no well you will be when we come back following the break because I don't

Who say that I Rishala,

[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.580]
Oh God, love the Aish,

[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:05.060]
And less of course you're gay.

[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:06.800]
If you are, you won't be marching

[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.240]
Upon Saint Patee's day.

[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:09.520]
You can be your bum,

[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:10.380]
A bucket of scum,

[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:11.400]
Sure, and that's okay,

[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:14.100]
But you can't be Aish if you're gay.

[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.520]
Oh, we're fine.

[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.400]
All the order of hyphurneans,

[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.660]
Those emanants is great.

[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.540]
Have delivered this pronouncement

[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.180]
Upon the blessed day.

[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.820]
Sure, a little bit of heaven,

[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.700]
Fallen nestled in the sea.

[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.900]
But you're gone straight to hell,

[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.340]
A homosexuality.

[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.240]
Oh God, love the Aish,

[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.760]
And less of course you're gay.

[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.480]
That was their pronouncement,

[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:40.900]
Hell's the heist begin to play.

[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.120]
You can be a Khan, a Mafia, a Donk.

[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.100]
God, love the Aanyway.

[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.720]
But you can't be Aish if you're gay.

[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.680]
Oh, L-E-S-E-A.

[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.720]
And S-P-L-L-S-B-N.

[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.020]
Choose another whim and part a mate with.

[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.320]
And development can never get a date with.

[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.800]
L-E-S-B-I-A.

[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.980]
And S-E-S-E-A.

[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.820]
It's the shame that these games

[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:10.780]
Want to come out and march with us.

[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:11.600]
L-S-B-N.

[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.860]
No way, but just as a carnival corner.

[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.900]
You sure are such a straight.

[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.800]
It's miles like the Kennedys,

[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.180]
The Bade this country great.

[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.060]
We don't allow Lope de Pan,

[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:23.280]
The wedding of the Green.

[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.760]
And when we say up the Aish boys,

[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:28.960]
That is what we mean.

[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.900]
Oh God, love the Aish,

[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.380]
As long as men are men.

[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.380]
Except perhaps the Leporcars,

[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:35.620]
We've never been sure of it.

[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.420]
You can be stinking, drunk, and hurled,

[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.720]
And drunks will laugh it all away.

[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:41.420]
But you can't be Aish if you're gay.

[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.680]
Oh, you can't be Aish if you're gay.

[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:45.260]
Stupid.

[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:48.100]
Don't even try B and Aish if you're gay.

[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:52.420]
10-0-0-0-5-60.

[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.840]
W-Q-M. Happy Wednesday, too.

[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.100]
Before we do that thing about the Internet,

[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.760]
Which, I'm amazed that you haven't heard about that.

[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.920]
Leaders of the Roman Catholic Dicees of Toledo

[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.240]
Placed on leave a priest accused

[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.600]
Of repeatedly sexually using a boy two decades ago.

[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:05.500]
When you hear the name,

[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:06.920]
It may set you back a little bit.

[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.720]
The Reverend Bernard Cockazinsky, 64.

[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.500]
I'm sorry, that's his name.

[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:17.500]
The Reverend Bernard Cockazinsky, 64,

[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:20.480]
Will be temporarily replaced as pastor of St. Anthony of Padua

[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.880]
In Columbus Grove, Ohio,

[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.420]
Bishop James Hoffman, said yesterday.

[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:24.740]
I do a kidneype ski.

[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:26.760]
William Clark.

[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.280]
I heard he was pretty cocky when I heard.

[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.760]
Now, 43, said he was raped and molested

[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.280]
By Cockazinsky in the rectory at St. Joseph Church.

[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.360]
In free mod, according to a lawsuit in Lucas County Common,

[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:38.940]
Please court.

[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.600]
Clark sued the priest last week,

[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.220]
Asking for more than $25,000 in compensatory impunity damages.

[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:48.000]
His case is the eleventh lawsuit being filed against the local priest

[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.880]
And the Toledo diocese since April.

[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.380]
He said he was raped and one of the nine cases alleges

[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:56.360]
That diocesan leaders knew of a widespread pattern of sexual misconduct

[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.920]
Among the clerics but failed to stop it.

[00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:01.940]
Of course, Cockazinsky has served in at least nine parishes since his ordination.

[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.620]
He declined to comment about these suit.

[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:04.940]
All he did was clear a throat and say,

[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.680]
Like that, that was it.

[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.660]
That's as far as he was willing to go.

[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:13.000]
So we're waiting to see if Maddie Bell is going to come through for us today.

[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.320]
Or could be another day.

[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.540]
Let's have that noon bit hour.

[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:20.040]
I think we're going to have somebody give me 367 votes on that poll.

[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:20.780]
They're pouring in.

[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:23.640]
We got noon to one, the big Wednesday noon to one hour today.

[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:25.180]
And thank God for that, you know,

[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.240]
Because the pressure was so great for Maddie Bell showing up.

[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:28.300]
Hey, let us down.

[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.960]
I'm sure it's not his fault, but he let us down.

[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.720]
Usually he comes waddling through that.

[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:35.020]
Hey, pal, he's kind of like, he's like fat boy junior.

[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.260]
You don't think they're all in suspense inside the building too.

[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.040]
They want, oh, you kidding me.

[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:40.920]
They want to see those numbers.

[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:41.920]
They want to squeeze them.

[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:42.860]
They want to examine them.

[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.480]
They want to look at them with a magnifying glass.

[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:47.280]
Believe me, they'll need one for some of the numbers.

[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.520]
I don't want to mention which day part.

[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:49.300]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.620]
Twenty till noon at five sixty.

[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.440]
How many QA and we all have different lifestyles, Mo.

[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.120]
Therefore, we need different products to make us feel better and be healthier.

[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.080]
Especially the older you get, man, start popping lots of that olio, man.

[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.340]
They have one for old age yet.

[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.040]
Well, don't forget.

[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:04.780]
Old olio, man.

[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:05.180]

[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.900]

How boy books and the telly.

[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:31.020]
Super.

[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:37.300]
And see all three in clocks and make chillin' socks.

[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:38.980]
Here's what smelly.

[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.280]
For a telly.

[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:44.040]
Dave and Shane gave him all the stuff.

[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.900]
Now he's got it rough because they sang him the present.

[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.800]
He's a present.

[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.820]
Looking back makes him want to solve even things.

[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.840]
A pop wasn't a good decision.

[00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:59.120]
A decision.

[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:05.860]
Plus Santa, Thursday night, he said David Chang like no one's fired.

[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:08.100]
Cause he's lying.

[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:11.100]
He's got egg on his face.

[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:14.820]
He pulled out of the race now he's done.

[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.240]
I saw him in a ride.

[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:24.940]
Maybe now he can buy a telly.

[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:29.320]

[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:33.580]

[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:37.560]
1146, 14 chillin' at 560 WDQ.

[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:41.360]
Here's a psychotic facts from Andy at Airebel Fabrics in North Miami.

[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.220]
Who says?

[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:47.020]
The reading of articles is torturous, especially extremely terminal and ponderous.

[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:49.300]
It's irrelevant why am I listening?

[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:52.960]
Something that you're number one in your time slot.

[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.120]
I don't understand that.

[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.820]
It's irrelevant why am I listening?

[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.360]
Nor that you're number one in your time slot.

[00:54:58.620 --> 00:54:58.940]
I read.

[00:54:59.120 --> 00:54:59.500]
Please, Neil.

[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:00.100]
Stop reading.

[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.380]
I'm feeling like killing some people when you read.

[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:04.440]
It's pure noise.

[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:04.780]
Yes.

[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.320]
This will be my last facts.

[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:07.100]
No, it won't.

[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:10.180]
All right.

[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.180]
Do you understand that?

[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:11.820]
It's stupid.

[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:12.200]
We are.

[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:13.140]
Ready to sign the point.

[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.240]
Now the desk's brought up.

[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:15.480]
It'll never be your last facts.

[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:17.300]
I just got a fact from Mark the Jets fan.

[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:18.940]
Another one.

[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:22.020]
You see you people out there who keep threatening you're going to turn it off.

[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.020]
I can sit here and go.

[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.040]
Move the movement like that for four hours.

[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:27.700]
And it's a lot easier than researching all these articles and reading.

[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:28.960]
It takes a lot less effort.

[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.220]
Move the movement like that.

[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:30.820]
I can loop that.

[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:31.440]
Yeah.

[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.540]
And then we can live up to the building that we're getting, you know.

[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:35.840]
Another train monkey.

[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:36.060]
Right.

[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:36.700]
Go on.

[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:37.580]
Move the movement like that.

[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.320]
Still get big numbers.

[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:40.200]
Still beat his numbers.

[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:40.900]
I guarantee you that.

[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:41.440]
No contest.

[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:47.220]
Now wouldn't you be embarrassed if you got beaten up by somebody making sounds of a train monkey on the air for four hours?

[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.380]
Move the movement like that.

[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:50.140]
No problem.

[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:51.300]
As long as they know it's me.

[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:53.100]
And of course, when they be sure it's me.

[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.940]
Just like how they're really sure that I'm here right now.

[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:56.380]
Was that the hockey game, didn't I?

[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:56.660]
No.

[00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:57.880]
See, I might not even be here right now.

[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:59.080]
We might just be funnier again.

[00:55:59.300 --> 00:55:59.600]
That's right.

[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.560]
Except for those people that saw me at publics on Sunday.

[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.520]
You could be at Rome.

[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.820]
I could be doing a show of guy named Rome or Rome.

[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:06.700]
Okay.

[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.900]
I could be the old gnome in Rome and you wouldn't even know it.

[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.800]
If it weren't for some people with loose lips that opened up a month at one Friday.

[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.100]
I just wanted to like one day, just one day.

[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.180]
Pullable over their ears.

[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:20.420]
I said you were traveling.

[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:21.120]
No, you did not.

[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:21.620]
That's what I said.

[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:22.020]
No, you did.

[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:23.620]
Did not say that.

[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:25.980]
Well, then it was Joe.

[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.020]
It was Joe Mama.

[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.560]
People presumed that I had let it out of the bag and then just went ahead.

[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:34.320]
See, why did you say, you see at the time you denied it now?

[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:38.180]
Now you think that because I'm old and feeble that my Alzheimer's is going to kick in.

[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:38.520]
I don't know.

[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.900]
It was the same thing at the time, but it didn't.

[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.560]
No, you did not.

[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.980]
You said to me, you said what you were talking about it, blah, blah, blah.

[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:43.460]
Like that.

[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:44.680]
You weren't talking about it tonight at all.

[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:48.500]
I was not talking about what I was going to start doing as you're just for one day to prove the point.

[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:51.760]
Then no matter where I was sitting on my ass that the show was going to sound the same.

[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:55.200]
Reading ponderous articles like the piss off that guy that just facts me.

[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:56.140]
So what?

[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.380]
So how's the weather in Toronto?

[00:56:58.580 --> 00:56:59.700]
So let me say this to you, okay?

[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:01.200]
It's getting pretty chilly up here, eh?

[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.240]
And I'll do one to show whatever I want to do.

[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.000]
Okay, we're still doing just fine.

[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:08.660]
And you're not listening because of my ratings.

[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:12.160]
And you're not listening because I've been on the air for 800 years here.

[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.160]
You're listening because you choose to listen.

[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.300]
You can be playing goddamn records right now.

[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.360]
You can be playing with yourself, which you probably are in between writing the facts.

[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.100]
But the bottom line is you're listening because you like it.

[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:22.840]
You love it.

[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.480]
They could be listening to classical music.

[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:26.980]
Even if you hated, you love hating it.

[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:27.640]
See what I'm saying?

[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:34.580]
And somebody who comes on here and lies to us that, you know, and pretends he hasn't listened since his birthday back in June.

[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.020]
Oh, George.

[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:35.340]
Yeah.

[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:39.460]
And then gets all crusty and bent out of shape about things that are going on the show.

[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.280]
He must have quite a pipeline, you know what?

[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:43.460]
He must have a bonsai pipeline.

[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:47.140]
People feeding him all kinds of information about what's happening on his goddamn show.

[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:51.240]
You know, I'll tell you what, maybe I'm going to throw all his crap away.

[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.580]
And I'll just live up to what he said way back when.

[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:57.160]
Maybe I'll just talk about him every day for four hours.

[00:57:58.660 --> 00:57:59.900]
Isn't that basically what he said?

[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:02.640]
He said if I didn't have the Catholic Church or him to talk about, I wouldn't have any show.

[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:07.300]
Which doesn't explain how I managed all those other 26 years before he came.

[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:09.580]
I agree. Well, that's what that bed to pay here.

[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.480]
But nevertheless, I have no problem with doing that.

[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.880]
It's an endless source of material and drop in.

[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:15.260]
Hello, George.

[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:17.660]
You know, they're endless.

[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:18.940]
Jesus Christ.

[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:23.120]
And then like that, that one thing this morning, I mean, it makes me kill some people.

[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.640]
Yeah. It makes me furious that.

[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:26.780]
Two then to the more on hour at nine o'clock.

[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.300]
Nice, nice, more on hour.

[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.680]
And I'm the one that wanted some promotion.

[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:30.600]
That's right.

[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:37.720]
And I'm delighted that he at least recognizes my existence now, which is a big improvement, promoting that we're going to play the audio from the.

[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:39.780]
A gubernatorial debate last night.

[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:43.200]
Anything, anything to even acknowledge there's something on the ear here at nine o'clock.

[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.260]
That's a step in the right direction, Mo, okay?

[00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:47.060]
You sorry, old ass?

[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:51.620]
Star and Galactic Heart confirms central black hole.

[00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:54.100]
Did you have to do that?

[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:56.880]
See, he knows his astronomy.

[00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:59.400]
He doesn't know about his internet, though.

[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:00.540]
I'm surprised you hadn't read that.

[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:00.900]
No.

[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.180]
Because that's one of the things that they're planning.

[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:04.000]
You know the evil doers?

[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:04.960]
Yes, yes, indeed.

[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:10.060]
Observations of the star closest to the heart of the Milky Way confirms the existence of a colossal black hole there.

[00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:12.220]
Astronomers announced last Wednesday.

[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.020]
A week or two today.

[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:18.340]
The star passes within 17 light hours of a compact radio source known as Sagittarius A.

[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:19.960]
Pagdis A. What race is he in?

[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.000]
The fifth.

[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:22.980]
Nice see.

[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:28.360]
A, after horse's name, and standard renharnest race, he means it's a horse that was bred in Australia.

[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:29.520]
Didn't know that did he have a good idea.

[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:30.800]
If it's in, it's New Zealand.

[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:31.500]
Really?

[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.060]
Yeah. Like douchebag N.

[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:33.920]
Is he in the codes?

[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:39.820]
Pagdis the Galactic Center and completes an oval orbit around the super hotspot every 15.2 years.

[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:50.020]
The orbit at attributes mean that the entire mass of the interior object between 2.6 million and 3.7 million times that of the sun is crammed within a space about three times the size of our solar system.

[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:53.760]
The staggering density can only result from a supermassive black hole.

[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:55.100]
Bray!

[00:59:55.800 --> 01:00:00.680]
According to physicist Rainer Chodell, who with colleagues published the findings in this week's journal Nature.

[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:09.300]
We can confidently now say that a black hole doesn't indeed exist at the center of our galaxy, said Chodell, who works at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Gartscheng, Germany.

[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:20.620]
Scientists suspected that the Galactic Center harbored a black hole, but hadn't ruled out alternative explanations for these Sagittarius A radio source, such as a dense cluster of stars or stellar material within a few light years.

[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:24.120]
How do you like that? We got a big black hole out there, baby.

[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.060]
Bray!

[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.180]
It could only have been a black hole.

[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:32.500]
That's what Scroan said.

[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.940]
Let's see, two suggestions for the 12 o'clock funnies.

[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:41.960]
The burps and... Oh, the chicken dance. What does that thing call?

[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.820]
Body sound effects. Something like that. I'll figure it out.

[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:49.480]
Root obnoxious, foul, and distasteful of the dolphins are losing.

[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.140]
Ah, that's that guitar man thing.

[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:54.020]
Cuxle hoist dolphin.

[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.880]
And he also, Scott, and Scott just getting really chronic.

[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.380]
He wants to hear that old lady who says...

[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.120]
What the hell are you?

[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.820]
Well, can you believe I remember where that was in Bank 3? What a memory, baby.

[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:07.420]
So there you go, Scott. You got like part of your deal, and I'll work on the other ones. I'll think about it.

[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.740]
Here's Warren, who fabled. They're busy on a fast machine today.

[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.280]
What's with the epidemic of non-promotion at QAM?

[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.360]
First, there was Moe ignoring the fact your show follows him.

[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.880]
Now, Joe and Mark Fame seem to have caught the fever.

[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.380]
Listening several nights and mornings, I noticed whenever Joe lists the line on each day,

[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.100]
conspicuously absences any mention of manage.

[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:26.880]
He never fails to mention Howard, then you at 9, Hank at 3,

[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.680]
is there a problem between them? Or is this just a condition of Joe's cross promotion with Moe?

[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.380]
I noticed Moe don't mention the mad dog either.

[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.120]
Maybe that's because he called him a slipped up and called a Moe that one time.

[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:35.620]
I'm sure.

[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.040]
Now, seriously, he'll start with Hank, and he goes through the thing in a ballgame,

[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:42.180]
and then we got the Eddie Kaplan, the dirty boy's over there, and that's it.

[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.780]
But there's no mention of like a mad dog.

[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.180]
Probably because he figures these part of the same day part.

[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.080]
10 to 3. Oh yeah?

[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.700]
And he just want to do anything to goose up 10 to 3.

[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.140]
Well, he doesn't understand, Moe. I hate to break the news to you.

[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:57.560]
What you don't understand is that everything that we're here on is based on 9 to 1,

[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.840]
because they have these amazing things called breakdowns and rating,

[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.680]
which we're looking for, where some people have a nervous breakdown when it come out, you know.

[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.620]
And we'll have when they see the hour by hour.

[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:06.900]
Stupid.

[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.300]
But they have the breakdowns.

[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.820]
You can tell who's been naughty and nice and what's going on 9 to 1.

[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.000]
And what's separate there from 1 to 3.

[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:15.640]
Maybe it's just an accident. Maybe just forgot about the mad dog.

[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:18.540]
But no, but that's good logic, because then he'll be able to say that 40% fewer.

[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.300]
Right. 40% fewer trained monkeys were listening to this summer and last summer.

[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:26.740]
So I think instead of reading all the articles, what I'll just do is I'll talk about that show all day for four hours.

[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:29.160]
Here's a fact from Jay.

[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.180]
It says if he were to conduct yourself as an adult.

[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.540]
Oh, this, you know who this is from?

[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:34.380]
Oh, yeah.

[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.340]
This is from, uh, always with a Jay.

[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.640]
Always starts with the Jay, see.

[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:41.100]
He typed it out to make, uh, they're thinking to do anything.

[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:42.480]
I'm not going to read your crap, Jerry.

[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.140]
Jay, whatever name you're using today.

[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:48.420]
You know what both of those rhyme with, don't you?

[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.840]
Jerry and Jay and today.

[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.360]
Yeah, yeah, that's what they rhyme with.

[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.020]
But have a nice day.

[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:58.980]
So I guess we got some cross promotional problems on his radio station.

[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.840]
Now we never had that before. Did we?

[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.140]
No, this is never ever had that before.

[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:03.240]

[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:04.060]
It doesn't a mistake.

[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.520]
No, he wouldn't be doing that deliberately.

[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.260]
Why you always stand up for Joe.

[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.100]
I like Joe a lot.

[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:09.960]
He was a good guy.

[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:11.340]
But he was here the other day.

[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:12.320]
He was, I don't know.

[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:13.880]
He's a little off his feet all of a sudden.

[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:14.660]
I don't know what his story is.

[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.640]
I think two, I think this guy's got it right.

[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.440]
Too much concerning with Moe.

[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.500]
His turn, his turn him.

[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:19.880]
No.

[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.600]
Yeah, I don't believe the facts.

[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:22.740]
What did he say about Moe?

[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:22.880]
No, show.

[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.420]
Both of you.

[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.560]
Come on, both of you.

[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:26.980]
Yeah.

[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.180]
Let's hear it.

[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:31.720]
Let's hear it.

[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.480]
Here's a good, here's an excellent fact.

[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.220]
This is the best fact we've had all day.

[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.120]
You know what it says?

[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:38.620]
What?

[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:41.940]
It says, I listen to the Nearodius show because I'm an asshole.

[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.520]
Oh, I've been, I've been, I've been from sunny Fox.

[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:45.700]
Hi, this is sunny Fox.

[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.860]
And I listen to Nearodius because I can hear the word asshole.

[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:50.240]
No, because he isn't assholes what he's really trying to say.

[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.720]
I guess we had that ass backward.

[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:53.840]
That sunny Fox bit.

[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.280]
Now what did Joe say about Moe?

[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.060]
And that morning's show?

[01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:58.620]
He wishes nothing but the best.

[01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.700]
Brian's with Blow or him.

[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.380]
Now come on, see you're just, you're hoping.

[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:03.480]
I'm lying.

[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:05.780]
Yeah, you're, we know your lying.

[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:06.920]
You said anything about it.

[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.080]
That's not true.

[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:09.760]
That is not, he's not into it.

[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.180]
No.

[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:10.840]
Well, why not?

[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:11.920]
What's wrong with it?

[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:16.340]
Are you knocking that morning's show now that we're, we're a part of that six to ten.

[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.280]
That's part of our day part.

[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:17.900]
I understand.

[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.180]
I hope everybody listens to it.

[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:23.300]
That's our partner show that we're trying to like goose up by talking about him until he can't stand it anymore.

[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:24.620]
Yeah.

[01:08:49.960 --> 01:09:05.520]
We live

[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:30.520]
It's a push and rumored they be cracked at home. Okay, we're gonna interrupt our big new to one hour because Maddie Bell came in here with the bad news for George. George

[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:36.600]
Oh, is an apology to that old man with a bad to pay. You want to apologize? Now, where should I do it for you?

[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:41.700]
Well, I could start. Yeah. I'm sorry. I suck.

[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:54.180]
Oh, here we thought that six to 10 was so bad because of the six to nine hour. Well, they're not that they were great. Hope you're listening, mall. Well, that's right. He'll hear it through the grapevine. Here, listen.

[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:08.720]
Man, 18 plus and at 25 to 54 thing, I got to look at that again. Can that be possible? Where's that thing again? I mean, he was pretty week. All right, six to 9 a.m.

[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:22.960]
Six to 9 a.m. and men 25 18 plus he was a number nine with a 4 point. Oh, number nine. Got that. 25 54 6 to. Oh, that's not our number. Excuse me.

[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:35.680]
9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 25 54. That's what that book that number three with a 5.1. Not even close. Not even close. Big with a 7.1. That's because the other Howard got all the audience 9 to 10.

[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:56.340]
See what I'm saying. I'm nauseous. But the pizza sure is good. Pizza is a lot of Brad over Tony's pizza at Northwest 2nd Avenue and 135th. Is that right? 191st. I'm close. They're about 1393rd and Northwest 2nd Avenue. Great.

[01:10:56.340 --> 01:11:25.020]
On vocal Brian comes in. Congratulations. Look at his baby. Bad timing. He just had a baby to bad timing. Brian. Very depressing. You're gonna have to start doing some attack George bits now. His rating sucked. Look at us. Our by hour. You want to what do you want? Men? I want men like it. Six a.m. and 18 plus. Most got a 4.3. In fact, tomorrow we're going to do a pull on how come Georgia's numbers sucks so bad.

[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:40.940]
4.3. Then at 7.4.0. Then at 8 o'clock, a 3.8 year. 9 o'clock, George picks it up a little bit. Not much 4.1. Then he's got two fine hours. Fine hours. 5.8 to 7.4.

[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:51.900]
Noon to 1. 5.3. Mad Dog picks up that 10 to 3. 5.8 to 6.3. Now we understand why I don't want to promote him because he's coosing up that midday.

[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:59.560]
He's a threat. Although you did have the biggest hour there. He had a 7.4. That's the biggest hour in the station from 11 a.m.

[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:11.680]
They just can't take that much. You anymore. They can take an hour day. That little spick talking about eating grisling. Howard in rush. I do really well. In between Howard, sperm and rush. You do fine.

[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:22.080]
But other than that, they embarrassing. So you owe him an apology. I'd go up to him tomorrow. After a first I'd pull off the two pay and I'd kiss him right on the big ball spot.

[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:27.000]
But still higher than his right. I give him a machine. What do you mean? It's still higher. Well, of course anything is higher than what am I supposed to do.

[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:34.120]
But his numbers weren't as bad as we've been saying though. They weren't like 2.3s. Well, you didn't have that 3.8. We had a terrible lead in.

[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:39.080]
In fact, 25 to 54. That's the target demo. Like I said, he was weak.

[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:48.800]
Six o'clock, he's got a 4.6 year on the duty boys. Oh, no. That's what his problem was. He won't be promoting them anymore. You need to lead in, Mo.

[01:12:50.180 --> 01:13:02.800]
Joe and Mark. Oh my God. 1 to 5 a.m. A 3.8 share in men 25 54. Pretty weak. It was bigger than that last book. No, lots of eights. Yeah.

[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:10.760]
The duty boys are where the problem is. And here we thought it was in the morning. It's the lead into the morning show. The duty go. That's the problem.

[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:17.960]
Because then he goes from at 5 in the morning. They got a 2 points this year. See, not everybody cares about who's got the biggest ass. Okay, Joe?

[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:26.460]
Well, I do. If he grows it up a little bit like about 2 more or our grades in school up to like about 4th grade at that level, maybe we'll get some more people listening to the overnight show.

[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:35.620]
Man, that's weak. That's weak. 2.6. And that goes to a 4.6 at 6 a.m. That's most biggest hour. And then once they hear his voice on here, they start running like crazy.

[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:50.440]
Because then it goes down to a 3.9 at 8 o'clock, a 3.2. And you just keep them right there. No, you don't. You actually went down. That you know something that from average quarter hours of 8,900 men, you went down to 8,100 men at 9 o'clock hour.

[01:13:51.440 --> 01:14:03.640]
But yeah, that is just shocking. And we want to apologize right here right now to the old man with a bad 2 pay for busted his ball. So I mean, his numbers are pretty lame.

[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:11.700]
But you sure as hell didn't goose them up in the 9 o'clock hour like we thought like you're like all the other books when other people were on here in midday.

[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:22.140]
Besides you now 10 o'clock you up to a 4.1 in 2554 men 11 o'clock. That's your big hour 7.5. They like you from 11 to noon. That's just that's before eating time.

[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:29.760]
It's right around lunchtime and they think about eating food eating ass. Then noon to 1.5.9 and mad dog is 6.1 to 6.3 mad dog done good.

[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:39.360]
Oh right. He didn't real good. And he saved your ass from real embarrassment. I'll send him a card. So we apologize. That's why we get the hour by hour. And we could make him up. We could say, hey, you got ones that we don't make that up.

[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:47.060]
Okay. We give it the real numbers. And we want to make a men's right now with the old man. No, no, no. He still makes us sick.

[01:14:48.820 --> 01:15:00.280]

And eating in cheap restaurants

[01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:36.170]
Hello

[01:32:36.170 --> 01:32:37.690]
Malker, it's scully

[01:32:37.690 --> 01:32:38.830]
I need your help

[01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:39.410]
What's up?

[01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:41.550]
I have something's going on inside me

[01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:43.930]
I feel like I'm going to explode

[01:32:43.930 --> 01:32:46.090]
It slides files

[01:32:46.090 --> 01:32:49.630]
What do you do when the forces of nature turn on you?

[01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:50.550]
Scully?

[01:32:51.010 --> 01:32:52.350]
I'm feeling it too

[01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:53.870]
What can it be?

[01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:54.810]
I don't know

[01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:57.770]
My room is filled with a stranger room

[01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:59.250]
My tooth

[01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:01.510]
Mable!

[01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:03.990]
It slides files

[01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:06.290]
We'll scully in moulder's nearby

[01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:09.190]
Must get to bathroom

[01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:10.770]
It slides files

[01:33:11.290 --> 01:33:14.610]
It's scully in mongers first encounter with an unidentified

[01:33:14.610 --> 01:33:16.110]
A Folking opposite

[01:33:16.110 --> 01:33:17.010]
What is that?

[01:33:17.410 --> 01:33:19.730]
No, it's just materialized in there

[01:33:20.410 --> 01:33:21.850]
It slides files

[01:33:21.850 --> 01:33:25.130]
Hey, it's better than the rest of the crap on TV

[01:33:25.130 --> 01:33:26.050]
Oh!

[01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:33.790]
Coming up tonight, I'm inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story

[01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:35.710]
We take it good, hard

[01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:37.310]
Stiff look in the start

[01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:41.410]
They gave boring old white people a shot at radio glory

[01:33:41.410 --> 01:33:44.990]
They were reflexes

[01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:49.650]
The politics of the world

[01:33:49.650 --> 01:33:50.430]
The end

[01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:53.350]
See, at the start of the song we say

[01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:56.670]
The politicians are now DJs

[01:33:56.670 --> 01:33:58.490]
The politics of the world

[01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:02.550]
And now DJs

[01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:05.570]
Reflex lead singer Baxter explains

[01:34:05.570 --> 01:34:08.170]
The band did not expect their son to be a hit

[01:34:08.170 --> 01:34:12.490]
They wrote it simply to promote their DJ fed as he came for aging politicians

[01:34:12.490 --> 01:34:17.090]
These repulsive, dried up people spent their lives in public service

[01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:21.630]
But never experienced the sexy glamorous world of spin in the hits man

[01:34:21.630 --> 01:34:24.530]
Tonight, you'll hear never before played segments

[01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:27.610]
Taken from the 1983 DJ fed as he came

[01:34:27.610 --> 01:34:30.230]
Like then vice president George Bush

[01:34:32.650 --> 01:34:38.310]
Yeah baby, that was Elvis Costella with every day our right in the book

[01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:44.290]
It reminds me, I have got to teach my son George W. to read before too long

[01:34:45.610 --> 01:34:48.890]
Now let's go to Oliver North with traffic

[01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:52.810]
Also with the mic was Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas

[01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:58.790]
Alright, that was to Rand Iran with Union of the Snake

[01:34:58.790 --> 01:35:02.410]
Now in a gal out there that wants a union with my snake

[01:35:02.410 --> 01:35:07.050]
We're taking colors 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

[01:35:07.050 --> 01:35:09.570]
Even Britain's Margaret Thatcher got in on the act

[01:35:12.930 --> 01:35:16.730]
That was Cindy Malpo with girls just want to have fun

[01:35:16.730 --> 01:35:18.870]
I'm going to record my own song

[01:35:18.870 --> 01:35:25.070]
Yes, and call it girls just want to cut back on social programs and sky over working classes

[01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:26.570]
Oh, Charlie Good

[01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:29.250]
The reflex DJ fed as he came

[01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:33.950]
Oh yeah, it's the politics of boo, boo feeling good

[01:35:34.570 --> 01:35:39.610]
It's a big juicy, sopping wet look at your business tonight on inside of I

[01:35:53.890 --> 01:35:54.490]
Oh

[01:35:54.490 --> 01:35:54.570]
Oh

[01:35:54.570 --> 01:35:56.930]
I am

[01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:05.650]
I don't know why they hate me

[01:36:05.650 --> 01:36:07.630]
Oh, why they always hate me

[01:36:07.630 --> 01:36:11.190]
It must be because I got this bull and ran in school days

[01:36:11.190 --> 01:36:14.810]
But they's not, on my arm like a ramic now he mappalaka wad

[01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:18.690]
I got things on my nose and nobody knows that under my clothes I wear empty holes

[01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:20.430]
But that don't mean that I'm gay

[01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:22.570]
If you think my arms are bad you ought to see my legs

[01:36:22.570 --> 01:36:26.610]
I might as well keep on smoothing shade to show little clasps the next time I'm raping it

[01:36:26.610 --> 01:36:28.970]
I could go to a surgeon that that gives me the shivers

[01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:31.090]
I would not want to walk out looking like Joe Rivers

[01:36:32.110 --> 01:36:32.850]
Where am I?

[01:36:33.390 --> 01:36:37.810]
I buy a little beast the fat little freak I did him a favor now we can afford to eat

[01:36:37.810 --> 01:36:43.590]
The reason I dismissed that stink and fat bastard is because he wouldn't shut up and he can't play conestin

[01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:48.170]
I saw him talk over there nobody talks when I rap I rap then you talk

[01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:54.230]
Look at me I'm hit, hit, I ain't no square I'm a ding-dong daddy man I'm really dead

[01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:58.030]
I buy a ready what I want I don't care

[01:36:58.030 --> 01:37:01.090]
But believe they make me flip my wig made a smelly green hair

[01:37:01.090 --> 01:37:04.190]
I got tired myself it even happens to the grapes

[01:37:04.190 --> 01:37:07.050]
Westwood once said you'll get out of here whilst we break your legs

[01:37:07.050 --> 01:37:09.790]
So now I sit by the pool life's as good as it gets

[01:37:10.230 --> 01:37:13.190]
With my paladin cocktail placing bets on the jeans

[01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:17.110]
Paradise paradise I don't kiss somebody's ass in paradise

[01:37:17.110 --> 01:37:20.710]
Go go go go I'll be sure to let the screw kids when I get the jeans

[01:37:20.710 --> 01:37:22.950]
But the cleaners aren't ready with my lime green pants

[01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:23.810]
How long does it take?

[01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:27.270]
Can we call it a play and we just a little thought so what I love this day

[01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:31.930]
I think that's funny when I'm not the sandwich buddy I can do what I want but the management loves me

[01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:34.070]
Get a guy a somehow something you ought to know

[01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:36.330]
But along with his time I wanted you to be my dog

[01:37:36.330 --> 01:37:38.770]
You and my title now we have straight, no no

[01:37:38.770 --> 01:37:40.170]
Who would you do?

[01:37:40.290 --> 01:37:41.310]
I won't take no for an answer

[01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:43.210]
But it's not you

[01:37:45.370 --> 01:37:48.970]
Don't do it, don't do it

[01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:51.030]
Don't do it, don't do it

[01:37:51.490 --> 01:37:53.790]
Don't do it, don't do it

[01:37:56.530 --> 01:37:57.490]
There's moosey man

[01:37:57.490 --> 01:37:58.830]
I cannot respond

[01:37:58.830 --> 01:38:02.110]
Okay well that's okay we don't bother us we're used to that

[01:38:02.110 --> 01:38:04.290]
He been out for a half hour he hasn't said a goddamn thing

[01:38:04.290 --> 01:38:09.710]
This might feel even a little bit better George trying to boost up George's morale a little bit because he's down in thumbs because his show sucks

[01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:11.150]
But anyway

[01:38:11.150 --> 01:38:13.410]
Pills or done or razor blade

[01:38:13.410 --> 01:38:14.890]
Gone is easy quick painless

[01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:18.930]
In fact we're gonna send you up to DCC area for a couple of days

[01:38:18.930 --> 01:38:20.830]
I'm gonna give you one of the big red shirt

[01:38:20.830 --> 01:38:24.490]
Anyway, listen to the S9, 6 to 9 AM, men 25 54

[01:38:24.490 --> 01:38:27.050]
Not only did he have only a 3.8 year you had a 5.1

[01:38:27.050 --> 01:38:30.890]
His average quarter hour persons in men, 8700

[01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:33.850]
You had average quarter hours, 20,900

[01:38:33.850 --> 01:38:34.430]
Oh

[01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:36.230]
See, don't I make you feel better?

[01:38:36.690 --> 01:38:37.150]
A little bit

[01:38:37.150 --> 01:38:38.430]
Yeah, what?

[01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:41.230]
You even beat out EDR, you beat out the Shvostation

[01:38:41.770 --> 01:38:43.830]
You beat Mo and Shvoh

[01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:46.030]
And Po, Koshin anymore

[01:38:47.210 --> 01:38:49.330]
And Joe, because they had terrible numbers overnight

[01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.870]
Right?

[01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:51.350]
Right?

[01:38:51.670 --> 01:38:51.890]
Three

[01:38:53.450 --> 01:38:54.170]
I beg your pardon?

[01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:55.250]
Number three

[01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:57.050]
In men 25 54

[01:38:57.050 --> 01:38:58.390]
You win number five last year

[01:38:58.390 --> 01:39:00.150]
Alright, alright, I guess I should have

[01:39:00.150 --> 01:39:02.890]
I'd like you to put you up by your bootstraps a couple of points

[01:39:02.890 --> 01:39:04.330]
See if I wouldn't have been sick that much in August

[01:39:04.330 --> 01:39:05.870]
There you go, we had a death knell in August

[01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:06.490]
I request I know

[01:39:06.490 --> 01:39:07.310]
So it's my fault

[01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:08.050]
Request for one

[01:39:08.050 --> 01:39:09.310]
Always look on the bright side of life

[01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:10.930]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:13.930]
Seriously, take a look at that

[01:39:13.930 --> 01:39:15.290]
Because he's gonna be blowing a horn tomorrow

[01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:17.250]
You know that, oh well you see that goddamn

[01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:18.250]
Just goes la pipe smoke

[01:39:18.250 --> 01:39:19.410]
I was talking a bunch of crap there

[01:39:19.410 --> 01:39:22.410]
About we sucked a big one and here we had a four share galley

[01:39:22.410 --> 01:39:22.990]
What do you think of that?

[01:39:23.130 --> 01:39:24.170]
He's gonna be saying how they did

[01:39:24.170 --> 01:39:26.030]
You still kicked his ass, okay?

[01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:29.010]
I mean, you did not so good, but you know

[01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:31.110]
And of course if I wouldn't have been back in September

[01:39:31.110 --> 01:39:32.470]
One can only begin to imagine

[01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:35.510]
Because we saw the breakout for September was a pretty good month

[01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:38.670]
So one can only imagine how calamitous it would have been

[01:39:39.170 --> 01:39:41.410]
But of course the show it's one thing to eat ass

[01:39:41.410 --> 01:39:43.050]
It's another thing to talk about it, you know

[01:39:43.690 --> 01:39:45.050]
Just like Bob Ramot told me

[01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:46.650]
It's a one thing for Square to be doing

[01:39:46.650 --> 01:39:47.010]
Bro!

[01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:49.050]
The other thing for it to be talking about it in public

[01:39:49.050 --> 01:39:53.050]
19 before 1 at 560 WQM

[01:39:53.690 --> 01:39:56.190]
If you got a nasty bald spot like Bokobrine

[01:39:56.190 --> 01:39:58.110]
Boy you ought to see the light shining off his head

[01:39:58.650 --> 01:39:59.770]
Man, he used a wax

[01:39:59.770 --> 01:40:01.310]
He's like the lighthouse Edison

[01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:04.090]
Or is it the other way around?

[01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:05.150]
Well something like that

[01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:07.270]
Anyway, if you're tired of looking like that

[01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:08.770]
If you're tired of having like a powdery wig

[01:40:08.770 --> 01:40:10.110]
Different shades every day

[01:40:10.110 --> 01:40:12.110]
Maybe he's just got a chameleon wig like Wichner

[01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:13.170]
The old man

[01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:13.850]
Which wig?

[01:40:15.610 --> 01:40:18.310]
Maybe the same one at Louis Rookhizer wears on alternate Sundays

[01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:20.490]
Pick up the phone and call Chuck Alphier

[01:40:20.490 --> 01:40:21.430]
Get some real hair back

[01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:23.230]
Because his natural hairline system

[01:40:23.230 --> 01:40:26.350]
That's the difference between his system and every single other one

[01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:27.750]
All the other ones it looks like a wig

[01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:30.110]
Charlie it looks like the real hair is growing out of your scalp

[01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:32.210]
That's why they call it the natural hairline system

[01:40:32.210 --> 01:40:32.850]
Get it?

[01:40:33.070 --> 01:40:33.690]

You'll get yourself a 200-hour discount off the regular price

[01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:43.230]
And all you got to lose is that disgusting bald spot

[01:40:43.230 --> 01:40:46.290]
Because Charlie guarantees his work for a 30 day period

[01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:47.870]
If you don't love the way it looks in the fields

[01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:49.710]
If you're not getting a head like every 15 minutes

[01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:51.470]
Just bring your hair back and say

[01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:52.530]
Hey Charlie how about the money back?

[01:40:52.690 --> 01:40:53.150]

What you done?

[01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:26.590]

I know I might expect some pain

[01:42:33.010 --> 01:42:40.010]
It will be easier on me baby

[01:42:42.730 --> 01:42:48.010]
If you could find the K and Y

[01:42:50.110 --> 01:42:52.010]

I'm old, I had another piercing accident

[01:44:03.250 --> 01:44:04.970]

He beast, you better clean that pee puddle before Moe gets home

[01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:19.770]
I don't know Wally, it's kind of achy

[01:44:20.630 --> 01:44:23.010]

[01:44:23.010 --> 01:44:25.070]

Hey come here beast

[01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:34.290]
Time we had a little chat

[01:44:35.010 --> 01:44:35.950]
Um, I don't know

[01:44:35.950 --> 01:44:36.670]
Okay

[01:44:36.670 --> 01:44:39.350]
No, you don't say anything to lump through other standard

[01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:41.790]
Okay, I said nothing lumped on token

[01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:44.910]
But you stop but I tell right that's it

[01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:47.070]
Remember my friend here?

[01:44:47.210 --> 01:44:48.430]
Mr. Belt

[01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:51.570]
Don't go, don't go

[01:44:52.130 --> 01:44:54.350]
Okay, I will you stop

[01:44:55.610 --> 01:44:57.290]
I said stop it

[01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:59.450]
You shake your mouth, your pipe smoking poof

[01:44:59.450 --> 01:45:02.110]
Okay, but don't stand near the window

[01:45:02.110 --> 01:45:02.890]
What for?

[01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:05.150]
Curts you might fall down

[01:45:07.690 --> 01:45:11.610]
It's 11 before 1 at 5 60 W come we got the mad dog the highly rated gym man

[01:45:11.610 --> 01:45:13.310]
It's 1 to 3 this afternoon boy

[01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:16.350]
He is a star, you better thank him, you better personally go get him a kiss on the cheek

[01:45:16.350 --> 01:45:17.990]
Kiss him my boat cheeks

[01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:20.870]
And then the Humper who did just fine what did the Humper do?

[01:45:21.670 --> 01:45:23.270]
You know the 6 to 7 hours sucked

[01:45:24.270 --> 01:45:24.790]
That's it

[01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:28.990]
Yeah, that's probably because in 5 and 6 when we got that Bino on there

[01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:30.890]
Everybody turns it off by 6

[01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:33.570]
The after-romal of Bino

[01:45:33.570 --> 01:45:36.870]
Because the 6 to 7 hour was really really weak Humper

[01:45:37.410 --> 01:45:39.450]
But like in men, let's see how did the Hank do?

[01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:43.970]
3 to 0 5 5 5 0 4 8 and 3 5 to 6

[01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:47.310]
He would have had a gigantic book if weren't for that awful 6 o'clock hour

[01:45:47.310 --> 01:45:48.670]
We'll find somebody to blame for that

[01:45:49.330 --> 01:45:50.230]
Oh, you know what?

[01:45:50.690 --> 01:45:51.090]
What?

[01:45:51.450 --> 01:45:54.330]
He wasn't on at the 6 o'clock hour most of the time he was on it was 6 30

[01:45:54.330 --> 01:45:57.010]
And we had that Marlon crap all summer long see

[01:45:57.010 --> 01:46:00.150]
The freaking Marlins that I notice some people are sucking up to again

[01:46:00.150 --> 01:46:01.010]
They're a killer

[01:46:02.130 --> 01:46:04.370]
They're a killer just ask Phyllis Diller man

[01:46:04.370 --> 01:46:06.070]
Who's doing a concert in Manila

[01:46:07.690 --> 01:46:08.650]
With Barry Diller

[01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:11.650]
Which one has the Tony?

[01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:13.890]
Now let's see what about men 25 54

[01:46:13.890 --> 01:46:18.070]
The Humper's got a throw is a 5 6 a 5 1 a 4 7 and a 4 4

[01:46:19.130 --> 01:46:23.270]
Which that last hour was his weakest and again because 6 30 to 7 was the Marlin

[01:46:23.790 --> 01:46:24.570]
Screwed a Marlin

[01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:28.570]
10 before 1 at 5 60 WQM as we try

[01:46:28.570 --> 01:46:31.330]
We're trying and we need dry concepts to come in here and do a job on us

[01:46:31.810 --> 01:46:33.110]
Clean us out on my shirt

[01:46:33.110 --> 01:46:37.170]
Oh, Georgia's pants are like covered with the brindle brown material

[01:46:37.170 --> 01:46:40.070]
I'm not really sure what it is and I'm positive I don't want to know

[01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:43.050]
Because I still haven't quite finished lunch but nevertheless

[01:46:43.050 --> 01:46:47.010]
Anyway, dry concepts will get brown and green and any cover crap out of your carpets

[01:46:47.010 --> 01:46:51.530]
And make them look sparkling just like brand new because they dry clean your carpets

[01:46:51.530 --> 01:46:54.570]
And let me tell you for the 80 million time they're the only people in the world who do this

[01:46:54.570 --> 01:46:56.010]
They're unmatchable

[01:46:56.010 --> 01:46:59.910]
They suck out even the deep down dirt way down in the fibers of your carpet

[01:46:59.910 --> 01:47:02.630]
Which makes them look and smell and feel just like brand new

[01:47:02.630 --> 01:47:05.010]
They smell emity fresh they're a dry and a couple of hours

[01:47:05.010 --> 01:47:08.870]
And you'll have the biggest smile you've had on your push since the last time you got laid last month

[01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:10.030]

[01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:34.490]
Oh, light up my room, I still messed up

[01:48:34.490 --> 01:48:37.250]
And I know why, why, where you at?

[01:48:37.890 --> 01:48:40.370]
Cause I got hot, you feel like I have

[01:48:40.370 --> 01:48:44.310]
You feel like I have, light up, I have

[01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:47.390]
I was gonna go to class, if I got hot

[01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:48.390]
Come on, y'all

[01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.870]
Check it out

[01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:51.790]
I could have cheated, and I could have passed

[01:48:51.790 --> 01:48:53.450]
But I got hot

[01:48:53.450 --> 01:48:57.570]
Oh, light up, I'm taking a next semester

[01:48:57.570 --> 01:49:00.310]
And I know why, why, where you at?

[01:49:00.930 --> 01:49:03.530]
Cause I got hot, you feel like I have

[01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:06.630]
You feel like I have, I was gonna dance, go to dance, go to dance

[01:49:07.170 --> 01:49:09.630]
I was gonna go to court, you feel

[01:49:09.630 --> 01:49:14.790]
Oh, I got hot, I was gonna pay my child support

[01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:17.270]
But then I got hot, no you wouldn't

[01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:20.470]
Light up, dance up my whole paycheck

[01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:23.330]
And I know why, why, where you at?

[01:49:24.030 --> 01:49:26.510]
Cause I got hot, you feel like I have

[01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:28.030]
You feel like I have

[01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:30.490]
La la la la, that that that that

[01:49:30.490 --> 01:49:32.330]
I wasn't gonna run from the cops

[01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:35.230]
But I was hot, I'm serious man

[01:49:35.230 --> 01:49:37.950]
I was gonna pull right over and stop

[01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:44.270]
But I was hot, la la la, that never-one-of-a-peer-a-plea-chaking

[01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:46.590]
I know why, why, where you at?

[01:49:47.250 --> 01:49:49.610]
Cause I got hot, you feel like I have

[01:49:49.610 --> 01:49:55.430]
You feel like I have, light up, I was gonna make love to you

[01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:58.190]
You feel like I have, I was gonna make love to you

[01:49:58.190 --> 01:50:01.070]
I was gonna eat your pussy too

[01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:05.490]
Oh, I got hot, I got hot, I got hot, I got hot

[01:50:05.490 --> 01:50:08.570]
Now I'm jacking up, and I know why

[01:50:08.570 --> 01:50:12.670]
Yeah, I got hot, you feel like I have

[01:50:12.670 --> 01:50:14.530]
You feel like I have, you feel like I have

[01:50:14.530 --> 01:50:16.670]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[01:50:16.670 --> 01:50:18.530]
I'm this to my entire life

[01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:25.410]
Cause I got hot, you feel like I have

[01:50:25.410 --> 01:50:30.170]
Say what, say what, say what, say what, say what, say what, now I'm sleeping on the sidewalk

[01:50:30.170 --> 01:50:33.010]
And I know why, why, where you at?

[01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:36.070]
Cause I got hot, you feel like I have

[01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:41.530]
You feel like I have, light up, that, that, that, that, that, I'm gonna stop singing this song

[01:50:41.530 --> 01:50:47.410]
Cause I'm hot, baby, baby, I'm singing this whole thing wrong

[01:50:47.410 --> 01:50:50.690]
You feel like I have, bring it back up

[01:50:50.690 --> 01:50:55.310]
And if I don't still want to be, I'm a wild, wild, wild

[01:50:56.550 --> 01:51:00.290]
Cause I'm hot, cause I'm hot, cause I'm hot, cause I'm hot

[01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:03.330]
Are you light on me at the, the, the, the, the, the

[01:51:03.330 --> 01:51:06.550]
Of course, you're gonna have to, you've practiced a lot, and told me you're gonna have to precipitously bad on this

[01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:10.330]
Cause I'm just gonna, a couple more friends, and I'll just go to the superior, and you'll have to get into that

[01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:13.330]
See, I'm thinking, I'm sitting here thinking to myself, you know, I had an 80's share

[01:51:13.330 --> 01:51:17.590]
Which, you know, he didn't do good, he did poorly, not as poorly as we had hoped, I thought

[01:51:18.110 --> 01:51:21.790]
But, uh, poorly, but if he would have an 80's share, nothing would change, you know

[01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:22.470]
He's gonna ask?

[01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:23.350]
Right, one way or the other

[01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:26.290]
Cause it's, it's business and personal, in his case

[01:51:26.890 --> 01:51:30.910]
A guy that comes in a time that blows in here and tries to get a guy that just had an unwanted baby fired

[01:51:32.170 --> 01:51:37.070]
And then is, uh, blowing people down the hall like left and right, caroling and the beast, all the good people

[01:51:37.070 --> 01:51:39.910]
Does blowing them all over the place? Too much blowing going on, you know

[01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:43.350]
Let's see how the numbers come out here on the pool, those are the important numbers

[01:51:44.230 --> 01:51:45.310]
463 votes, heavy duty

[01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:49.510]
The reason Mohauer-David's ratings are so weak, and they are weak, he's a pompous ass 105

[01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:55.410]
I don't know, I only listen to Neil 99, who's Mohauer-David 63, he showed blows 61

[01:51:55.410 --> 01:52:00.390]
I don't know, I don't listen to him 44, I love Mo 23, 4.9%

[01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:02.170]
Is he following that?

[01:52:03.850 --> 01:52:10.350]
He's boring, 23, yell these two squeaky 19, he's alienated to everybody else's audience 11

[01:52:10.350 --> 01:52:14.530]
Because unfortunately his show never sounded better 8, and the beast book bad guess 7

[01:52:14.530 --> 01:52:17.610]
So the beast is in last place, in the situation where it's great to be laughed

[01:52:17.610 --> 01:52:18.730]
You like that a lot?

[01:52:19.730 --> 01:52:21.710]
Don't forget, go out and see Miguel today, he's there another hour

[01:52:21.710 --> 01:52:25.850]
From now to a clock at the QM Van at the Amico 34-1 Viscan Boulevard Miami

[01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:31.930]
And maybe you might win a trip or two to see that often play the Jets in New York with Dan Moreno at quarterback Bob Greasy and Earl Moral

[01:52:31.930 --> 01:52:33.350]
Bye, bye, bye

[01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:37.430]
You're gonna need a watch or show, I'm 5-6, I'm gonna need QA and Miami for another day

[01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:40.090]
4th place, with the sewer of this place
