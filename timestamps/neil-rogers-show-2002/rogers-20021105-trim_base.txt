[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]
Then if guy's f**king blow!

[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.800]
Happy day to you.

[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.680]
Happy day to you.

[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.500]
Happy day to you.

[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.280]
Oh god, oh god.

[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.200]
Happy day to you.

[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.240]
Oh god.

[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.100]
You never know who will call Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.280]
Howard David, voice of the Miami Dog.

[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.880]
I'm going to tell you what, and you don't need the shameless plug.

[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.360]
But I listen to you guys every day.

[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.580]
You guys are doing a hell of a job.

[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.080]
It's fun to listen to and O'Brien.

[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.020]
I mean the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.500]
What?

[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.800]
Did I hear that right?

[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.720]
Back up the tape.

[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.060]
By listening to you guys every day.

[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.300]

Wow, even Mohauer David listens to Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.600]
Exactly.

[00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.460]
Hope you've seen me in the ring. You better than I am.

[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.040]
Even the competition agrees.

[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.740]
The Neil Rogers show on WZTA Miami Beach,

[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.000]
Fort Lauderdale and the Palm beaches is the best morning show in South Florida.

[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.780]
I think I was just a nice girl on an A.L. station as a hero in my book.

[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.180]
You're like, face time is the quietest.

[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.220]
You got no problem with me.

[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.920]
Even the other morning shows listen to the Neil Rogers show on Zeta 4.

[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.080]
I hope you've beaten me in the ring.

[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.000]
You better than I am.

[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.060]
You never know who will call Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.420]
Howard David, voice of the Miami Dulles.

[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.500]
I'm going to tell you what, and you don't need the shame.

[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.900]
It was plug.

[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.360]
But I listen to you guys every day.

[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.580]
You guys are doing a hell of a job.

[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.100]
It's fun to listen to and O'Brien.

[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.020]
I mean the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.440]
What?

[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.800]
Did I hear that right?

[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.720]
Back up the tape.

[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.040]
By listening to you guys every day.

[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.280]
You guys are doing a hell of a job.

[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.820]
It's fun to listen to and O'Brien.

[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.720]
I mean the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.040]
Wow.

[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.860]
Even Mo Howard David listens to Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.600]
Exactly.

[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.180]
And welcome back to the Howard David jaw.

[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.580]
What is that?

[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.780]
It's a pink toy.

[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.900]
Let that guy who played the father.

[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.040]
What are you stupid?

[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.140]
Everybody hates or stupid?

[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.720]
Get that off there.

[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.200]
Okay.

[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.820]
Okay.

[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.580]
Besides, if you recall as my yesterday's meeting,

[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.940]
I made my own open.

[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.140]
Now play it.

[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.720]
Yeah, but see if you...

[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.960]
You will obey me.

[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.680]
I said play it.

[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.740]
Hello again.

[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.420]
From paradise.

[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.140]
I am the mayor of Morning Dry.

[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.140]
And if you fail to kiss my brown eyes,

[00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:46.430]
I can see the leaf on that blue die.

[00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.970]
You never know who will call Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.150]
Howard David, voice of the Miami Dog.

[00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.290]
I'm gonna tell you what.

[00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.350]
And you don't need the shame.

[00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.770]
It was plug.

[00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:59.130]
But I will.

[00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.250]
I listen to you guys every day.

[00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.450]
You guys are doing a hell of a job.

[00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.010]
It's fun to listen to and O'Brien.

[00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.910]
I mean the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.350]
What?

[00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.690]
Did I hear that right?

[00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.570]
Back up with him.

[00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.930]
I listen to you guys every day.

[00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.150]
You guys are doing a hell of a job.

[00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.670]
It's fun to listen to and O'Brien.

[00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.610]
I mean the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.910]
Wow.

[00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.730]
Even Mohawar David listens to Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.470]
Exactly.

[00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.230]
Evidently.

[00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.530]
904-560-WDQ.

[00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.330]
I'm happy worth it.

[00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.510]
And me.

[00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.270]
George got me as usual another great gift.

[00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.510]
This one I'm gonna actually use.

[00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.370]
What?

[00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.970]
Well, I mean like that great exercise bike you got me a few years ago.

[00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.310]
Oh, no.

[00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.610]
I mean, it's a nice thing.

[00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.510]
I'm gonna use it.

[00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.370]
A digital still camera.

[00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.030]
I'm thinking I can like hover in the window in there and take pictures of most pieces moving around.

[00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.030]
When that'd be great.

[00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.650]
Can you see me standing in the window with that little thing?

[00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.430]
And the camera too.

[00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.270]
Anyway, quite a countertops around here I guess after I have no idea how we got that Fox Sports promo.

[00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.290]
But somewhere it like sneaked right under the door where it seems to happen a lot on the show.

[00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.130]
Thanks to Randy Maltosch my good friends at the ticket offense team.

[00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.890]
Beautiful, beautiful thing.

[00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.730]
A floral whatever.

[00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.370]
What is it?

[00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.910]
It's about a plant.

[00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.390]
It's a plant but not just a plant a beautiful plant, huh?

[00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.730]
Two or three kinds of plant in a big basket without now two or three different kinds of flowers.

[00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.050]
And anyway, thanks Randy.

[00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.590]
Great guy.

[00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.990]
Also a bunch of birthday cards.

[00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.230]
Thanks to my good buddy Wayne Arnold at Arles Royal Castle.

[00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.430]
125th and Northwest 7th Avenue.

[00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.250]
See there's the free plug way and you're the best.

[00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.930]
And Hudson too.

[00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.650]
And thanks to Diane and Boyton Vich who sends me a very provocative almost x-rated birthday card.

[00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.310]
A little disappointing though when you open up on the inside.

[00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.810]

[00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.090]
Oh.

[00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.050]
At any rate.

[00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.190]
Who's this from?

[00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.190]
Oh and a nice Scarlettus from Don Bailey Jr.

[00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.550]
There's a good guy.

[00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.950]
We got a few good people around here.

[00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.110]
As a matter of fact yesterday I get off the air at one o'clock and who's standing in the doorway there with Ken Maldon.

[00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.510]
But my good friend Joe Zagaki.

[00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.930]
And we had a nice handshake and a good chat for two or three minutes.

[00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.470]
We bonded.

[00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.050]
See because I tried to explain to the audience for a long time.

[00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.770]
With Joe and me it's business.

[00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:54.590]
It's not personal.

[00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.030]
I know Joe for years.

[00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.150]
Joe is a good guy.

[00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.730]
We liked you.

[00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.770]
We have no problem with Joe Zagaki other than he's boring.

[00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.270]
But that, you know, he's that's business.

[00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.750]
And a person of his good guy.

[00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.630]
And he gets it.

[00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.650]
He gets it.

[00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.510]
He don't take it personal.

[00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.410]
He gets it.

[00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.210]
Unlike some people who take it personal because they're too uptight.

[00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.270]
You never know who will call Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.030]
How are you David?

[00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.470]
Voice of the Miami dog.

[00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.590]
I'm going to tell you what.

[00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.070]
And you don't need the shameless plug.

[00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.550]
But I listen to you guys every day.

[00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.790]
You guys are doing a hell of a job.

[00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.330]
It's fun to listen to and O'Brien.

[00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.210]
I mean the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.650]
What?

[00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.970]
Did I hear that right?

[00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.050]
I got the taste.

[00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.230]
I listen to you guys every day.

[00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.450]
You guys are doing a hell of a job.

[00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.050]
It's fun to listen to and O'Brien.

[00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.910]
I mean the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.210]
Wow.

[00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.030]
Even Mohawar David listens to Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.770]
Exactly.

[00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.450]
Oh, huh.

[00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.890]
9.06 here's a card.

[00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.250]
Nice card from Phil who's family lives in Amsterdam.

[00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.050]
Time to get that monkey off your back by the way.

[00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.990]
Phil, people are talking.

[00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:49.810]
Now they're trained monkey.

[00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.970]
Don Bailey, Jr.

[00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.410]
Who's this?

[00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:53.330]
A Wayne Arnold?

[00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:54.750]
And a couple of other run outs.

[00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:55.570]
That's what it did.

[00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.470]
I don't want to overdo it.

[00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.890]
And at this advanced stage of my life who the hell wants to see it.

[00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.890]
Thanks from John Portse, loosely by the way.

[00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.070]
Here's a picture of some of our trailer trash folks in Florida.

[00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.310]
And the big science is teach our children reading, writing, and arithmetic.

[00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.570]
Not whatever else it was going to say.

[00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.190]
I'm sure psych.

[00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.530]
Obviously another Florida grad.

[00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.090]
Aritha Tech.

[00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.330]
Yeah.

[00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.210]
Another product of the great Florida education system.

[00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.710]
Anybody's having any problem voting today?

[00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.030]
The wait's are only going to be two, three, four hours, five hours, six hours.

[00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.890]
Just take the day off.

[00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.210]
Especially in Broward County.

[00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.710]
Where they have two thousand less of those voting machines that end day.

[00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.630]
Even though Broward's got the most number of voters.

[00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.150]
If you recall back on September 10 in the primary.

[00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.530]
We're always making fun of the Yahoo's in Tampa and St. Pete, all those people on the west coast.

[00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.130]
The fact of the matter is that even in those very heavily populated counties like Hillsborough and Peneas County.

[00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.470]
That they have no problem.

[00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.390]
By like 10, 30, 11 o'clock on September 10 on election night in the primary.

[00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.570]
They all their votes were tallied.

[00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.210]
It was a done deal.

[00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.950]
I was the end of that.

[00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.690]
And down here the same old tired crap.

[00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.810]
I don't want to at the risk of sounding racist again.

[00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.590]
If Miriam Elephant were white, they think she'd still be working all the way.

[00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.630]
I will say this in all fairness.

[00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.670]
David Leahy last time I saw him.

[00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.130]
He was still white and he's still got that job.

[00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.030]
And there's something very, very wrong with all of that.

[00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.650]
As a matter of fact, Bill Humper from CNN is down here, Miami.

[00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.830]
On election day, why do you think that is?

[00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:21.090]
And he just had our good friend Ed and Buchanan on there talking about us being the laughing stock of the universe.

[00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.570]
The only thing you don't understand, Bill, is we don't care.

[00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.350]
We're used to it.

[00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.010]
We're consistent.

[00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.790]
We may not be good, but at least we're consistent.

[00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.610]
We're consistently incompetent inept full of crap.

[00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.510]
1049 votes on a poll yesterday.

[00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:33.810]
Here's a note from Laurie.

[00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:35.670]
A happy birthday note.

[00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.630]
We also went out and voted for Bill.

[00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.110]
Listener and Sunrise went out and voted for Bill McBride.

[00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.130]
No matter what they say, what he's polls and Jeb is eight points ahead.

[00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.310]
And this one is so many points ahead.

[00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.110]
Just go out there and take four or five dark folks with you.

[00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.550]
Okay, make sure they get to the polls and vote.

[00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.210]
And you will monitor the situation.

[00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.430]
Make sure that they all get to vote.

[00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.690]
And don't get asked for like 85 pieces of ID.

[00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:57.610]
1049 votes.

[00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.090]
How do you feel about the election?

[00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.910]
It's very important 374.

[00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.510]
I'm voting, but not excited.

[00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:03.570]
295.

[00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.170]
It's life and death.

[00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:06.050]
148.

[00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.550]
I'm not voting why bother 143.

[00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.090]
That's the worry.

[00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.150]
89.8% say what?

[00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.510]
Me worry.

[00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.690]
Like what are we going to do about it?

[00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:15.230]
I don't know.

[00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.790]
I have kind of like missed emotions about the whole thing.

[00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:17.130]
You know what?

[00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.770]
Like I don't want to say it's a lost cause.

[00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:20.410]
But you know what?

[00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:21.870]
But you don't live here anymore.

[00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:22.690]
It's a lost cause.

[00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:23.990]
That's one good thing there.

[00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:24.510]
Right.

[00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.950]
I just kind of like have a legal residence, but generally speaking.

[00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.550]
I stay away from here as much as humanly possible.

[00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.990]
I think that's a good thing to be asked me.

[00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.430]
Yes.

[00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.830]
Anyway, here's today's poll.

[00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:39.490]
In the wake of that grotesque unbelievable, perhaps even unprecedented thing we just played.

[00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:40.910]
About 20 times already.

[00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.790]
And you're going to hear a lot more today in case you missed it.

[00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:43.550]
Call all your friends.

[00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:50.630]
A promo that they're actually playing on one of the lowest rated sports stations in the history of mankind next to the fan.

[00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:51.230]
You're lead departed.

[00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.350]
That's Fox Sports, Slot Sports.

[00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:01.130]
And come to find out that it was an unsolicited call that Mohawar David called into the laughing hyena Tony Bruno show.

[00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.490]
Unsolicited to consult with the enemy.

[00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.570]
I wonder if you think that their pan on is a payroll.

[00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:05.830]
No.

[00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.370]
No, they's not in their payroll yet.

[00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:08.730]
Maybe he ought to be.

[00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.050]
Maybe they'd like to have him over there is the mayor of the morning in that paradise.

[00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.410]
I think that'd be a great idea.

[00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.750]
What do you think, Geldie?

[00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:16.390]
What do you think?

[00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.310]
Now we can find somebody get Carolyn back in there with Geldie.

[00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.430]
Get that pompous ass out of there in the morning.

[00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:27.770]
At least Geldie mentioned my name today and I guarantee if he didn't have the shadow of the pompous one hanging over all those threats.

[00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.070]
He might even not have to make any difference whether they mentioned our name or not.

[00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.850]
Just the way it's done.

[00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.190]
Just the way it's done.

[00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.690]
You know, call up the competing radio station and say, oh you guys are doing a great job.

[00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:37.810]
I listen to every day about about it.

[00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.430]
See the thing with Joey and me on Zeta.

[00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.250]
That was a regular thing we had going with all the other FM stations.

[00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.790]
I mean, that was just comedy.

[00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.270]
But this guy's actually concerning with the enemy.

[00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.270]
Of course, going out of his way to do while I'm on the ears.

[00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:49.530]
I'll show you.

[00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:50.510]
I'll show you.

[00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:50.830]

[00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.590]
Yeah, you showed me all right.

[00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.850]
Now see, looking peace.

[00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:55.370]
Bring in the good one tomorrow, Mo.

[00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.210]
11 Pat.

[00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.090]
Does he have a good one?

[00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.170]
11 after 9 at 560 WQ.

[00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:01.930]
And here's the poll.

[00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.470]
What should the punishment be for Moe Howard David sucking up to the enemy Fox Sports Monday?

[00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.230]
That's the poll.

[00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:09.250]
Here's your seven choices.

[00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.330]
One, two, three, four, five, seven choices.

[00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:12.910]
Fire his old ass.

[00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:14.730]
Steal his two pays.

[00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.070]
He gets raped by the whole staff.

[00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:18.390]
He gets raped.

[00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.870]
Wait, wait, wait.

[00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.130]
Whole staff at which station?

[00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:21.330]
Oh, both.

[00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.050]
He gets raped by freaky Carlos.

[00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.090]
No penalty.

[00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.130]
He gets a gold star in a purple jelly bean.

[00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.930]
Now nobody will remember that unless they remember the old Jerry Wichner show with a gold star in a purple jelly bean.

[00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.350]
Old Farts like me.

[00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.090]
Banish him from Paradise.

[00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:37.830]
Or who's Moe Howard David?

[00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.190]
Those are your seven choices on today's award winning pool on your Rogers dot com.

[00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.570]

This is Sports Radio Fies City.

[00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.130]
You way out.

[00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.310]
Finished with the sewer of this place.

[00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:08.370]
Stupid.

[00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:35.250]
The money, love and retard points the bombers the wrong way.

[00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:45.890]
And oven barrows to be in Americans where they follow those like cheese.

[00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:53.390]
The United States of Americans, led by Bush and his family, re-legraph this country.

[00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:58.530]
Up, an appealing door to the darkest days in our history.

[00:12:58.530 --> 00:12:59.970]
He'll soon people.

[00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.290]
They train us to believe.

[00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:40.770]
And anyone who says that, obviously, and before to be.

[00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:49.250]
And oven barrows to be in America where we pay three logically.

[00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:57.610]
We've a flag in what has with our hand in the sand and blindly follow the powers that he have aesthetic.

[00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:03.710]
Up, washing state produce on a 65 inch screen.

[00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.770]
Scratch your balls and find everything's okay.

[00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.750]
In the goddamn USA.

[00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.170]
Oh, what's America?

[00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.970]
You never know who will call Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.150]
Howard David, voice of the Miami Dog.

[00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.790]
And you don't need the shameless plug.

[00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.250]
But I listen to you guys every day.

[00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.470]
You guys are doing a hell of a job.

[00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.070]
It's fun to listen to and all Brian.

[00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:30.890]
I mean, the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.370]
What?

[00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:32.690]
Did I hear that right?

[00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:33.610]
Back up with Terry.

[00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.170]
If I listen to you guys every day, you guys are doing a hell of a job.

[00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.730]
It's fun to listen to and all Brian.

[00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.590]
I mean, the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:44.730]
Wow, even Mohawar David listens to Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:45.430]
Exactly.

[00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.270]
Come on, by the way, the H over there, too, Mo.

[00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.550]
I don't want you to feel bad, but the H over there, too.

[00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:54.570]
918 at 560 WQIM, a very scandalous episode yesterday.

[00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:56.810]
One of the worst in the history of broadcasting, I would think.

[00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.630]
Not that anybody around here cares.

[00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.130]
They'll give them like a dirty look and say straight in your two pay out.

[00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.970]
Mo and it'll be about it.

[00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:03.710]
They're scared of this old man.

[00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.550]
Nine votes on there already.

[00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.230]
We just, they're just put it up.

[00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.070]
Stuck it right up there.

[00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.290]
What should the punishment be for Mohawar David sucking up to the enemy Fox Sports Monday?

[00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:12.830]
Who's Mohawar David for?

[00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.630]
That always seems to went out, you know what?

[00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:16.910]
Mohawar David.

[00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.670]
Fire is old, I asked three.

[00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.790]
Steel is two pays one and banish him from Paradise One.

[00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.430]
The other ones don't have any votes yet, but they will.

[00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:24.790]
Trust me, they will.

[00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.370]
So anybody vote yet?

[00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:29.030]
Only going to take you like four or five, six hours in Broward.

[00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.630]
Don't let, don't be deterred by that.

[00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.010]
Because that's what the whole idea is.

[00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:35.710]
Because Broward, of course, being the most liberal and the most heavily democratic county

[00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.050]
in the state, the most populist as well.

[00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.290]
That's the game plan.

[00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.730]
That's probably why we have two thousand less voting machines in Broward to keep as many people

[00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:42.870]
from voting as possible.

[00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.190]
These are the same people who wanted to bring this kind or gentler fashions back to America.

[00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.330]
And I think they succeeded.

[00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:54.050]
It's not important that you get to vote unless, of course, you're a very light-complexed.

[00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:54.930]
That's the important part.

[00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.630]
Did you see George P up there on stage introducing Daddy?

[00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:58.870]
Oh, brother.

[00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.130]
No, he was like, God.

[00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.710]
Spinning around like a dreidel in heat.

[00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:04.810]
Another donkey face.

[00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:09.490]
And if you notice what a, the governor is kind of like chubbed up a little bit.

[00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.750]
Yeah.

[00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.890]
Instead of, yeah, they ought to call him chub or shrub.

[00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.430]
Huh?

[00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.750]
In fact, when the two of them were together on stage, I could have introduced them as chub and shrub.

[00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:17.330]
Would have been good.

[00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.930]
But he's, I don't know what that's all about.

[00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.750]
Why does he got a lot of stress?

[00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:24.790]
You know, he's got that one daughter that's got the little, little bit of a Noah's problem or something.

[00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:26.610]
A little bit of a Noah's problem or something.

[00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.190]
And then back into seems to that family.

[00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.870]
And then the two sons just are like over here a height and sex crazed and whatever else.

[00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.510]
And then the wife she's got this habit of smuggling stuff in.

[00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.770]
But other than that, it's a good, the Board of Game Christian family, if you ask me.

[00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:38.890]
Five six.

[00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:39.890]
I beg your pardon?

[00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:40.910]
Some of them are Catholic.

[00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:41.510]
Well, that's right.

[00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:42.370]
I'm sorry. I keep forgetting.

[00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.250]
But well, he didn't, he used to be Board of Game Till.

[00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:45.730]
He rubbed off on him.

[00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.070]
Now he's now he's wearing a cross.

[00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.610]
In fact, George's got his own just, just for the election today, we got our own everything.

[00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.330]
I'm going to, in fact, where's my old Yarmico's?

[00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:52.850]
Do we have any of those?

[00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:53.970]
Oh, there's the pile of them.

[00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:54.630]
Oh, there's the pile of them.

[00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:54.830]
Oh, I got it.

[00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:55.510]
The pile of them.

[00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.950]
Oh, this is the one I want.

[00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.950]
With the beanie, with the prop, with the propeller on it.

[00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:04.910]
It reminds me of Greg.

[00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:10.870]
Did you see the story about the Greg on the, the fun, the grand father of spring break?

[00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.030]
What does his name Greg something?

[00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:13.970]
He's dying of liver cancer.

[00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:16.470]
That's so sad.

[00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:17.190]
It is.

[00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:18.710]
Have you ever seen him?

[00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.290]
He wears, he, you've never seen him?

[00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:20.610]
No.

[00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:23.970]
He wears the beanie with the propeller on it to cap and all kinds of stuff.

[00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:24.070]
Yeah.

[00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:28.910]
So I got my skull cap, my Yarmico, my schmatto on the head with the propeller no less.

[00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.470]
And George has got the rosary, the, with the propeller.

[00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.190]
I should probably put a pair of, uh, set on of beads.

[00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.990]
Yeah.

[00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:36.370]
Can't hurt.

[00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.750]
Put on a set of beads.

[00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.130]
Let's pray today for, uh, same goodbye to the jet-meister.

[00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.190]
I don't think we got a prayer, but let's give it a shot anyway.

[00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:42.510]
Okay.

[00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.870]
All you dark folks out there, don't forget, vote four, five, six, seven times.

[00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:46.550]
At least.

[00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.150]
W-D-Q-I-M.

[00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:50.230]
Hello.

[00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.950]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.790]
Uh, first of all, happy birthday from Madison, Wisconsin.

[00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.970]
Thank you so much.

[00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.630]
I was at the game last night.

[00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.770]
And you should have saw Moelstreatin' her out in the field before the game.

[00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:01.130]
Really?

[00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.190]
You'd have thought he owned that place.

[00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:09.050]
Yeah, I couldn't get close enough, but I could tell who he was by the roadkill on his head.

[00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.190]
By the aroma, probably.

[00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:10.490]
Yeah.

[00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:17.770]
Um, one thing you, uh, up here in Wisconsin, I don't know if you know, we had Moeldo in the Bucks Games for a while here a few years ago.

[00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:18.430]
Why didn't know that?

[00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.890]
So, yeah, we already know all about Moel.

[00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:21.310]
Mm-hmm.

[00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.550]
And one other thing, uh, he was in WTMJ a few weeks ago.

[00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.230]
You mentioned Earl Glesby in WTMJ in the game.

[00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.750]
Right.

[00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:32.190]
And you wanted to know who his partner was with Blaine Walsh.

[00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:33.270]
Oh, yeah.

[00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.230]
Well, that's so long ago.

[00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:35.130]
Yeah.

[00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:39.790]
So, anyways, happy birthday and Moel, he was strutting it up here last night.

[00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.230]
Well, I was job last night, of course.

[00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:46.570]
It could have been, really, it should have been about 48 to nothing, but nevertheless, I guess they took kindly the poor dolphins.

[00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:47.810]
There might be people coming up here.

[00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.330]
Yeah.

[00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.010]
Ray Lucas isn't going to be the answer.

[00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.190]
Maybe for Piper High School, he might be okay.

[00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.510]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.030]
Yeah, you bet, bye.

[00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.210]
Okay, vote early and often in Wisconsin, whatever they're voting for up there, not too much, I guess.

[00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.370]
See, this thing, this is not shaped well, so you have to wear it over the front.

[00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:02.210]
Oh, I see.

[00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.450]
That's the most waiting one.

[00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:05.890]
Well, I'll find another one.

[00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.090]
This one doesn't get the judge and do justice.

[00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.270]
How about if you wear like kind of like...

[00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:10.930]
There you go.

[00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.530]
With the tilt on it.

[00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:15.130]
WQAM.

[00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:15.970]
Hi, Neil.

[00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:16.430]
Happy birthday.

[00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:16.890]
Thanks.

[00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.250]
I'm going to report on my voting experience.

[00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.610]
Excellent.

[00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:21.890]
That's what we want to hear all day today.

[00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:27.770]
I live in North Miami and where I went to vote, it's pretty quiet, laid back.

[00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.350]
Really?

[00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:28.970]
No problems.

[00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:37.170]
Yeah, I live on the right side of the truck as you're heading towards the Bay Harbor, so it's not so dark in the park of North Miami that I live in.

[00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:37.550]
Really?

[00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:45.170]
However, the only thing, it was pretty easy with the electronic voting apparatus.

[00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:51.870]
The only difficult part was there is an amendment having something to do with the death penalty, rewarding the death penalty.

[00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:53.990]
Oh, the 549 word...

[00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:57.290]
The thing went from the top of the screen all the way to the spot.

[00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.550]
I needed like five attorneys to my left.

[00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:03.310]
Holding in a state like this where they put a 50,000 word amendment on a ballot with everything else.

[00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.990]
And I mean, I couldn't concentrate on just understanding what everybody's talking about me.

[00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.670]
See, I think what a lot of people...

[00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.710]
Well, I mean, I can't tell people what to do, but it would seem to me one of the logical things.

[00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.790]
If you find something that's so long and confusing, just skip it.

[00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.910]
You don't have to vote on everything that's on it. Just skip it.

[00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:22.010]
But there was that and other parts, so I just left blank and skipped it.

[00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.150]
Right.

[00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:23.050]
I didn't want to deal with that.

[00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.010]
When did I leave it out?

[00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.530]
But I did vote for McBride for Governor.

[00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:27.570]
I wish I could vote.

[00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:27.930]
Oh, right!

[00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.130]
50 more times.

[00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.770]
And it would be great for if they present for you if Jeb was gone tomorrow.

[00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:33.710]
Oh, the best.

[00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:34.890]
You can only hope and pray.

[00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:37.090]
Two things.

[00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.030]
One, and I've heard other people call about this.

[00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:42.770]
I'm still waiting for my CD which I ordered a month ago.

[00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:47.950]
I'm hoping to have it before more than enough to get Social Security if there's any left.

[00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:49.590]
Maybe. I wouldn't bet on it, but maybe.

[00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.510]
And the other thing is, you want to take a break from election coverage.

[00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:53.810]
There's a new small deal tonight.

[00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:55.910]
What day is it?

[00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.490]
Tuesday.

[00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.750]
Oh, it's Tuesday. That's right. See, I'm confused. I know it.

[00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.570]
When it gets to be your 60th birthday, you lose track of everything.

[00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:03.490]
It's a very frightening thing.

[00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:05.550]
Some lady shows up claiming to be Tom.

[00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.270]
Yeah, I saw the previous of that. The tonight figures to be one of the best ones of all.

[00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.070]
Great. So I'm definitely going to be two minutes.

[00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:11.830]
Thanks for the reminder.

[00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.210]
Have a good day. You too.

[00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.170]
Yeah, see, I'm slipping. That's two out of three weeks. I nearly forgot.

[00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.250]
That would have been bad because tonight's going to be heavy duty.

[00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.870]
Yeah, for my birthday, Clark's going to give me a big surprise of what I'm hearing.

[00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.250]
Here's the fact this is happy birthday, Nile.

[00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.750]
My brother and I enjoy your show. My brother who shall remain nameless Paul.

[00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.350]
Is it? Is it you? I'm a graduate. I'd like to show you.

[00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.910]
But disagree with your opinion on you.

[00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.790]
Marricay.

[00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:39.270]
He says you're full of it when it comes to you.

[00:21:46.150 --> 00:22:08.750]

[00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.630]
I

[00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:15.210]
32 at 560 WQA I'm happy election day. Do you want everybody out there who agrees with us of course?

[00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.410]
What are you smiling about that's the truth if you don't agree with us data? Hello home, okay?

[00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.410]
That isn't much better looking young. Look up by the way

[00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:23.130]
It is yeah, oh this is

[00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:30.990]
Why Lee coyote this is me 86 votes on a pool what should the punishment be for more Howard David sucking up to the enemy Fox sports with that

[00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.950]
I've not just called it Tony the laughing hyena Bruno yesterday

[00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.390]
Who's more Howard David 29?

[00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:43.010]
That always seems to lead the way they have no idea who you are. I'm getting proud fire is old ass 25

[00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:46.970]
Steel is to pays 14 let's see. It's changing again

[00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:57.830]
He gets raked it by the whole staff 10 vanishing from paradise for he gets raped by freaky Carlos 3 and no penalty gets a gold start a purple jelly bean one

[00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:03.330]
Poor Jerry what's there if he could just infuse matter of fact that Jerry were still around the computer to pays

[00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:06.870]
See Jerry is much more creative. He didn't have to have a whole bunch of them for different days

[00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:13.850]
He just had one chameleon one. They used to change colors depending on his mood depending on how tough the ride was down the Ho Chi Minh trail

[00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:16.570]
Bush calls calls critical of McBride

[00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:21.390]
In the Palm Beach Post just a day before the election meaning yesterday

[00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:27.310]
Governor Jeff Bush stopped the company tied to the Christian coalition for making telephone calls claiming challenger Bill McBride

[00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:29.270]
Doesn't support traditional families

[00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:33.630]
Atlanta based on by the way speaking of the Huracones are we getting screwed?

[00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:38.790]
Don't you think there's a conspiracy in the BC as pull another we're down at number three and also by the way now that the

[00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:42.550]
Huracones had such a tough game against the little girls team Saturday and the dolphins

[00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:44.890]
Got embarrassed last night

[00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.510]
Aren't we cursed to live here?

[00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:52.730]
See a couple of weeks ago we were blessed to live here and now we realize especially on election day

[00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:58.210]
It's gonna be a mess. We are cursed to be here. Oh, there's that silly ass Dave Barry on CNN

[00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:01.270]
One of the silliest guys never said a funny thing in his life

[00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:06.610]
And yeah exactly that was the fact that's the funniest thing you ever said right there

[00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.770]
You know what sounded a little bit like a little like that

[00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.290]
Let's make get him a mo together

[00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:18.810]
Anyway, Atlanta based century strategies began sending out the automated messages Saturday to 50,000 religiously conservative Floridians

[00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:20.730]
claiming the message was paid for by the Bush campaign

[00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:25.970]
And maybe if the Huracones would play like I'll hell of a lot more games against real teams instead of like 90% against

[00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.310]
Big east and little girls teams like Florida a&m

[00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:32.230]
Maybe they might think it'll a little more recognition. Okay, so quit your whining. We're getting screwed

[00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.370]
It's a conspiracy much a whiners

[00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:39.030]
But Bush said he heard the calls only yesterday after McBride raised a ruckus over the issue of not supporting marriage

[00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:44.390]
I didn't know about the calls. I don't support them at all. I said take him down as quick as you can Bush said

[00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:49.310]
Sure, I don't think it's true that there's only one candidate who supports the traditional family. That's outrageous

[00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.150]
Mr McBride does as well. He said

[00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:57.750]
The phone message waiting to hear who made the message the phone message which correctly states that McBride supports the right to abortion

[00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.530]
And Bush doesn't was recorded by century strategies found or Ralph Reed

[00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:06.510]
That little twerp the former president of the national Christian coalition

[00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:11.010]
McBride said the calls work the kind of unacceptable tactics that his campaign is avoided

[00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:14.370]
I'm proud of the way we've campaigned. This is the kind of stuff that shouldn't be tolerated

[00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:16.670]
Others involved with this campaign were less kind

[00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:20.830]
It just shows how low they'll go to win the elections said Bob Poe Florida Democratic Party chairman

[00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:24.690]
Their ruthless in their pursuit of power and Bob you are absolutely correct

[00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:28.930]
The phone calls and mail or coincide with a heightened religious tone to Bush's campaign

[00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:33.170]
For the past two Sundays Bush's campaign and predominantly white Baptist churches

[00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:40.290]
In predominantly white Baptist churches where he's expressed his unflagging support of protecting innocent life and traditional families

[00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:41.710]
It's the fetus huggers

[00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:47.510]
The good old boys against everybody else especially you dark. He's not the matter where it is except our Cuban friends

[00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.390]
That's what it's all about

[00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:52.410]
There's the lovely Tommy with an even not now. He's wearing a hat too. That won't get the job done

[00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:55.310]
Not that rain catcher. Tommy's wearing the rain catcher

[00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:58.010]
Bush reached out to Christian conservatives in his first election

[00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:00.070]
Which he nearly lost it and given a lot in Charles 94

[00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:03.990]
Bush moderated his tone and idea when he won but now it's gloves off baby

[00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:07.270]
Now he's a good farbic and a right winged boy and they like it

[00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:12.130]
I just I still don't get it. I mean can the majority of people in the state be of that ill-cure

[00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:12.530]
I see

[00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:14.570]
That's right I forgot where it was

[00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:19.290]
That's right. I forgot oh bad news by the way. Got some very bad news always some sad news

[00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:20.970]
King of Skiffle

[00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.250]
Lonnie Donigan dies at 71

[00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.330]
died yeah

[00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:31.430]
King of Skiffle Lonnie Donigan once a big influence on the Beatles has died at the age of 71 after collapsing on tours publicists

[00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:32.110]
They say yesterday

[00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:37.610]
Donigan changed the face of British popular music launching a Skiffle boom. Did you ever hear that?

[00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:39.510]
No neither die

[00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:46.370]
The Skiffle boom of the 50s with hits that range from rock island line through cumble and gap to the of course the most favorite

[00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:52.450]
And best is does your chewing gum lose its flavor on a bed post overnight. No, that's a skiffle

[00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:58.850]
The singer would suffer several heart attacks and was campaigning a backtrouble by it Sunday with his third wife Sharon and son Peter at his side

[00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:00.970]
In the central English town of Peterborough

[00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:05.510]
He was halfway through a British tour now already been forced to cancel two shows because of ill-health

[00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:09.390]
Donigan was hailed as the voice of Skiffle a gritty blood and a folk jazz gospel and

[00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:11.970]
Which the Beatles acknowledges a major influence

[00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:17.670]
Eric Clapton had invited Donigan to perform an attribute concert later this month performer Beatle George Harrison

[00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:22.110]
John Lennon was playing a Skiffle band to quarryman when he first met Paul McCartney, but she didn't know that

[00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:25.850]
Nope. Well now you learn something already not even 10 o'clock and you learn a whole bunch of stuff

[00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:29.210]
Like that Ralph Reed is the right wing. Oh, we already knew that asshole. We knew that

[00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.670]
And then Moe Howard David is concerning with the enemy

[00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:33.970]
I think that you know

[00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:35.610]
They're probably gonna try to like cover that up again

[00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:40.290]
Just like his comment about the bullet through the head. I did a grotesque unacceptable things. He's done here. I know

[00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.110]
But they are small potatoes

[00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:51.050]
I mean this guy is like out of control unbelievable. Oh look at this bushes refore madness

[00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:55.910]
This is gonna. We have to read this and only goes on about 7,000 pages. Thanks Gary

[00:31:55.910 --> 00:32:02.350]
How long is this damn thing? Oh my god like I said it only goes on about seven pages not thousand and it's seven pages

[00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:03.850]
Too long

[00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:06.610]
Thanks anyway Gary me but we're good to it and maybe not

[00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.530]
Wtq. I am

[00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:11.570]
Hello

[00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:18.030]
Gone oh brother while I probably went to vote again Wtq. I am

[00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.990]
Hi Neil. Yes, sir happy to you. Thanks. I voted this morning

[00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:26.510]
Yeah, and I wanted to make sure that everybody make sure that they check the vote

[00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:32.490]
After they register them all and they have the page that reviews it. Mm-hmm. I voted for McBride

[00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:37.170]
I I knew all my things I studied them before I went I voted the machine got them

[00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:39.890]
Seven wrong including the governor's race

[00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.210]
Bush showed up as governor no matter how I voted

[00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:50.530]
And that and let me tell you it happened to somebody else in the same polling place and my next door neighbors that it happened to her yesterday

[00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:56.430]
And Bush showed up no matter how you voted. Well coming back to Bush the second time I voted

[00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:01.930]
I you know, I brought it back to the page and I called the guy over. I said this machine's not working right

[00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:02.670]
And I

[00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:10.270]
Went and voted for McBride again brought up the first page. It was empty with blank. Mm-hmm. I had to do it three times

[00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:14.390]
Then the guy shut down that he said well that we have to

[00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:22.650]
Yeah, he says we have to reprogram this machine. Yeah, I said reprogram it. What are you kidding? I mean

[00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:27.110]
And like I said it was happening to somebody else in the same poll

[00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.210]
I heard them talking about it on the other side

[00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:33.330]
That's why that's why over the weekend they up the because they the fixes in bigger than it was before

[00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:37.870]
So they up the poll margins so it doesn't look too suspicious when he winds up winning by 15 points

[00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:45.370]
Well, I it's very depressing. I'm very upset and Tadatria at the year, you know, I am so sick of religion. I could pukes

[00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:51.030]
But in any case, I want everybody to make sure they please pull up if you don't have to go through anything else

[00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:56.290]
You don't want to just make sure you check to make sure the right governor is gonna elect it

[00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:58.550]
Unbelievable any place else but here very very

[00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:01.370]
Thanks to the thanks for the good effort and have a happy

[00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:04.450]
She's not that old meal. Yeah, especially here. See you

[00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:08.810]
Yeah, let me tell you right now this election is fixed. Okay. This election is fixed

[00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:10.950]
There's no question about it. Just like every election in Florida

[00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:13.650]
And this isn't something brand new. This isn't just the bush people

[00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:17.550]
This goes all the way back to the metro fail speaking to my friend Richard Friedman to call with that boring call yesterday

[00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:21.830]
The metro fail back in what year was that that was a long time ago

[00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.630]
One two, whatever it was

[00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:31.750]
Yeah, it was during Reagan. So it was in the early 80s the metro fail election totally totally bogus totally fixed

[00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:36.330]
All night long and that was one of those elections where they tried to rig it because if you were in favor of it

[00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:42.070]
Vote know if you were against it vote yes the same old twisted crap like did it on the uh Mickey Irson arena confused the voters

[00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:42.830]
Screw them all up

[00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:47.470]
And all night long you're watching the returns on there with Ralph redneck

[00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:52.650]
And it's losing it's losing it's losing people don't want to go to metro rail

[00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:55.950]
Want to spend the billions of dollars for a fair for a train of course to nowhere

[00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:59.070]
I mean, it's great for the people at shorties and that's about it, you know

[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:02.490]
And the people downtown all 100 of them who work downtown

[00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:07.830]
And then all of a sudden late at night. Well the votes just came in from homestead and it's uh passed

[00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.090]
Can't you I can't you just imagine all those people in homestead relanxions to have a

[00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:16.950]
Uh metro rail system and built that ends like on Dixie highway and uh where we're going to highlight is

[00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.710]
Sure then they can take it to downtown

[00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:24.990]
But they can't take it to downtown. It's not anywhere. It's like nowhere near them unless they move to high alia well

[00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:30.350]
942 another fixed election in Florida all you people from CNN you better

[00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:35.190]
Strap yourselves in baby because it's got to be another long night not just around the rest of the country

[00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:39.250]
But especially here because the fix is in make no mistake about it

[00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:42.810]
In fact, this probably be the last election we ever have

[00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:47.230]
I think after the big Republican sweep this time today which it probably will be uh that'll be it

[00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:52.710]
We just won't bother with elections anymore. They'll say it's too difficult. We can't get the technology right so we aren't gonna have anymore

[00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:55.030]
Yeah

[00:35:55.030 --> 00:36:00.590]
Just like our friends the Saudis. Did they have any elections? No, so let's be a lot more like them. We'll have more oil that way

[00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.750]
Let's face it you've been here at about fast train for a long time

[00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.850]
I wonder if it makes sense for you the facts are simple like so many of you people out there are simple

[00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:12.910]
If you have the dedication fast train will provide you with an necessary train to become a certified computer professional

[00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:18.190]
According to Time magazine prestigious time magazine the demand for computer professionals is exploding

[00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:20.290]
It's getting bigger every day in the demand too

[00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:24.730]
The average student completes the training in just four short months attending school only three nights a week

[00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:30.350]
Once you complete your certification fast train and hope you're getting a great new computer job and making a big fat paycheck

[00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:36.390]
Every payday fast train advice you to come in and visit their train career counselor and determine which track is ideal for you

[00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:41.350]
Maybe it's north field downs. Maybe it's Hazel Park. Maybe it's Saginaw harness raceway or Batavia downs

[00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:46.470]
Call fast train toll free at 1 866 fast train to self-in-appointment with four convenient locations

[00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:47.690]
Can't the vote count the vote lady count the vote count the vote over count the vote count the vote lady count the vote count the vote over count the vote

[00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:54.730]
Ever since this presidential race began

[00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:58.010]
Live up and wondered who was going to win

[00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:03.130]
Some palm beach people went to do their voting chore

[00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:08.190]
So count up for the ballots and find out who's got more

[00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:20.970]
Those old folks seem to have one thing in common looks like lots of them just keep their votes to Patrick you can and boy

[00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:26.330]
So I'd like to know who won the election

Then I saw a new splash on channel 10

[00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:57.170]
Some may repeat for all together in a bunch

[00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:02.150]
They said they were confused and didn't know which hold a punch

[00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:13.570]
Those old folks seem to have one thing in common looks like lots of them just keep their votes to Patrick you can and

[00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:20.290]
So I'd like to know who won the election

[00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:01.510]

[00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:05.110]
that's gonna be a real wild time in the old town of the night, Magnoma Stakeabooted.

[00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:08.450]
Muffles just in, she said it took about half an hour to vote today, and it's not too bad.

[00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:14.790]
Here's the fact that it says first is that 940 promo you played earlier for real? Yes it is!

[00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.110]
I know that's chocky. Just chocky over there and if you don't believe that...

[00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:18.530]
They're playing it! They're playing a crap out of it!

[00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:22.570]
You never know who will call Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.930]
Howard David! Voice of the Miami Dolphin.

[00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:28.850]
I'll tell you what, and you don't need the shameless plug, but I listen to you guys every day.

[00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.570]
You guys are doing a hell of a job, it's fun to listen to and O'Brien.

[00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:33.510]
I mean the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:37.530]
What? Did I hear that right? Back up with you guys every day.

[00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.310]
You guys are doing a hell of a job, it's fun to listen to and O'Brien.

[00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:42.190]
I mean the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:47.330]
Wow, even Moe Howard David listens to Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:48.090]
Exactly.

[00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:50.970]
See I think what he ought to do is start playing that for himself on his show,

[00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:52.850]
starting tomorrow when it comes back from Greengate Bay.

[00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:54.370]
He won't be good at it.

[00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:56.110]
Moe. American Spartans says Moe.

[00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:58.730]
Oh that's right, he won't the Moe here is that, the Moe of City gets.

[00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:01.890]
Too bad it says that because it would have just said Howard David.

[00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:05.090]
He could play that instead of mentioning my name 9 o'clock every morning.

[00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:06.570]
He could promote his good friend Tony Bruno.

[00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.730]
And if you could have that hyena laughing in the background, that would be great.

[00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:11.810]
Come on Moe, there's the challenge.

[00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:14.450]
Let's start promoting Tony Bruno on the Fox Sports.

[00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:17.050]
Get that 1.7 up to almost a two share.

[00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:20.310]
5 6 7 0 5 6 the how's that pool coming?

[00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:20.930]
A lot of votes.

[00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:23.710]
People that can't vote in the election today they're voting on our pool.

[00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.890]
151 already.

[00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:27.650]
Man, Holy Toledo is Rick Weaver would say.

[00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:29.130]
War Rick Weaver was sure good, you know what?

[00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:31.810]
What should the punishment be for Moe Howard David,

[00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.150]
sucking up to the enemy Fox Sports yesterday,

[00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.010]
with an temperate promo that called it he made to Tony Bruno,

[00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.010]
which he just heard a segment of, that asked sucking call to the enemy.

[00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:42.450]
Who's Moe Howard David and did 49?

[00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:44.710]
Fire is old, ask 39.

[00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:46.570]
Steel is to pays 30.

[00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:48.450]
He gets raked it by the whole staff 14.

[00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:50.990]
Vanishing from Paradise 7.

[00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:53.110]
He gets raked it by Freaky Carlos 6.

[00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:56.150]
No penalty gets a gold star in a purple jelly bean 6.

[00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.230]
That must be the witchner crowd.

[00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:00.610]
Those of us who are still alive.

[00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:02.590]
The Jerry Wishinger crowd.

[00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:06.190]
J.D.L. leader, Brain Dead and Suicide.

[00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:06.590]
Oh!

[00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:08.570]
Los Angeles.

[00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:12.330]
Jewish defense league chairman Irv Rubin was declared brain dead yesterday.

[00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.770]
After attempting suicide in the prison where he was awaiting trial,

[00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:18.310]
I'm charged as a conspiring to bomb a mosque at a U.S. Congressman's office

[00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:19.730]
is lower in federal official set.

[00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:22.590]
It's a terrible personal law set attorney Peter Morris.

[00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:25.870]
No relation to Philip.

[00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:30.730]
Rubin 57 was released from his cell in the Metropolitan Detention Center

[00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:34.990]
between 5.30 and 6.00 a.m. 8.30 in 9.00 a.m. Eastern time for breakfast at a William Wolsey.

[00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:36.870]
A spokesman for the U.S. Marshal service.

[00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:40.750]
Sometime after that he sustained self-inflicted injuries using a shaving razor

[00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:41.570]
to cut his throat.

[00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:42.670]
Wolsey said.

[00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:46.470]
Rubin then fell or jumped from his cell block here to the level below an 18-foot drop

[00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:47.730]
and landed on his head.

[00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:50.790]
Wolsey said Rubin's intention was to take his own life.

[00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:51.270]
No kidding!

[00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:52.350]
That's pretty profound.

[00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:54.010]
We thought he was just showing off.

[00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:56.510]
Rubin was taken to county.

[00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:58.250]
Maybe he was just training to be a stuntman.

[00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.750]
I don't know.

[00:42:58.930 --> 00:42:59.850]
He's trying to get on jackass.

[00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:00.770]
That could have been it.

[00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:02.670]
Maybe he wants to be in that next jackass flick.

[00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.570]
Oh, by the way, nice promo for Howard Spurman, the papers again this morning.

[00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:07.330]
As if he needs it.

[00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:09.330]
Rubin was taken to county, U.S.E.

[00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:11.610]
Hospitality was put on life support declared brain dead, Morse.

[00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:13.050]
What a shame, isn't it?

[00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:16.330]
Uh...

[00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:17.970]
Facts is just pouring in here today.

[00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:20.530]
It's all over folks.

[00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:22.990]
It was a nice run for a couple of hundred years, but it's all over.

[00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:23.810]
Democracy's dead.

[00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:26.750]
Terrible thing to say, but it's true.

[00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.970]
Wouldn't stick and roll me either.

[00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:28.530]
Uh-oh.

[00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:32.790]
From the Edinburgh news, police charged man over sex with traffic cone.

[00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:38.710]
A man caught performing an indecent act on a traffic cone has been charged by police.

[00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:39.570]
Was it Jeff Cohen?

[00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:43.430]
A 33-year-old's been and nothing would be the indecent on him.

[00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:47.650]
In fact, maybe a mole way out of put that choice under it too gets raped in by a ponytail.

[00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:52.830]
With his big black friend named Ben Gay.

[00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:57.130]
The 33-year-old has been charged with breach of the peace after police received reports.

[00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:01.190]
The man was engaging in a sexual act with a cone at the bottom of Colton Hill on Tuesday night.

[00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:03.130]
This is the Edinburgh news, the Brits.

[00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:08.430]
Alarm passers-by called police and said they had seen a man trying to have sex with a traffic cone.

[00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:15.390]
Officers from the Gay Field Police Station attended and found the 33-year-old committing the offense.

[00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:21.110]
A police spokesman confirmed police have been called to an incident in the Carlton Road to the Indian Center Report that's been to the...

[00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:23.370]
The procurator fiscal.

[00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.490]
Oh, it was Dr. Kent Handler, you know.

[00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:30.030]
That goes to show all your kids out there. Too much spotted dick and it goes to your brain, all right.

[00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:31.290]
Right straight to your brain.

[00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:32.550]
Turns it to Jello.

[00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:34.830]
Jello, which is kind of like head cheese.

[00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:37.410]
Yeah, that's what it turns to.

[00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:38.190]
Jello, head cheese.

[00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:39.530]
Yeah, oh, I can...

[00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:42.930]
You know, if you go to a deli and they got head cheese, I look at it and I get physically ill.

[00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:43.130]
Right.

[00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:44.050]
I don't know what's worse.

[00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:48.930]
Going to like an open-air food market where they have seafood, where they got fish and seafood.

[00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:50.290]
And that smell that...

[00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:52.250]
Oh, wow, you can relate to it.

[00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:53.110]
Yeah.

[00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:56.170]
Either that, but if that's worse or they're looking at the head cheese.

[00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:59.030]
W-A-Q-I-M.

[00:44:59.390 --> 00:44:59.750]
Neil.

[00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:00.350]
Yes, sir.

[00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:02.670]
Hey, I just got my F-N-T ballot today.

[00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:03.370]
Yes.

[00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:04.370]
Better late than ever.

[00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:04.790]
Uh-huh.

[00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:06.850]
It has a page missing.

[00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:09.110]
The one with the county...

[00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:16.190]
Including the one with the county question, where they want to increase the county commissioner's salary from 6,000 to 8,7,000 a year.

[00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:16.750]
Yeah.

[00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:20.070]
Well, who do you think you are to be voting on something like that?

[00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.510]
Just let them have their money and don't you be interfering.

[00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:25.790]
And, M-K-N, I voted for M-K-B-R-E last week.

[00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:28.210]
My partner voted for M-K-B-R-E today.

[00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:31.570]
And he's definitely M-K-B-R-E also has to chink in the fact votes.

[00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.250]
Yeah.

[00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:33.230]
At least I hope.

[00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:35.610]
The chink vote, how many chinks are there?

[00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:38.690]
Well, uh, we know a few Asians, so hey.

[00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:41.750]
But the ones that we know, they're all voting for M-K-B-R-E.

[00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:47.490]
And then you fags out there that vote for that silly ass pussy of Bob Kunz, whatever the hell his name is.

[00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:48.950]
You people ought to be in jail.

[00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.190]
I actually know four LCR who are voting for Bush.

[00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:53.670]
Oh no.

[00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.910]
Yeah, that's a thing.

[00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:56.030]
Well, let's just explain what that is.

[00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:59.010]
I mean, self-hating queens, log cabin Republicans, LCR.

[00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:00.350]
Uh, yeah, okay.

[00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:01.510]
Well, thanks a lot, Pally.

[00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:02.150]
All right.

[00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:02.850]
Go do it again.

[00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:03.770]
And vote too.

[00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:06.250]
LCR, self-hating queens.

[00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:07.630]
They're the last ones that go to camp.

[00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:08.370]
That's what you know.

[00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:09.690]
No, they're sludge heads.

[00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:15.470]
5-6-7-0-5-60, pound 5-60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:17.590]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:19.010]
Hello.

[00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.630]
Yes, sir.

[00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:21.030]
Uh, Neil.

[00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:21.490]
Yes.

[00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:24.410]
I voted in dear field beach this morning.

[00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.930]
And?

[00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:29.910]
Um, uh, the people on Channel 10, I was watching the news last night and they said that the polls were open at 6.

[00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:38.650]
So I got there, well, they said 6, though, it's their fault, but I got there early and there was a whole line of black folks there.

[00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:39.370]
All right.

[00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:40.210]
That's good news.

[00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.910]
Excellent.

[00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:44.550]
And in fact, the whole, uh, I guess maybe it was a church band.

[00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:47.110]
They pulled up and a whole bunch just got out and gotten lines.

[00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:48.630]
Let's bust them in by the thousands.

[00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:50.690]
Let's bring them in from the Carolinas if we have to.

[00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:51.670]
You know it, baby.

[00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:52.650]
I voted for McBride.

[00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:53.150]
All right.

[00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.550]
Thanks.

[00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:54.070]
Thanks.

[00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:55.470]
Right.

[00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:57.070]
That's right.

[00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.950]
Good old boy, baby.

[00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.250]
Never stole a freight train.

[00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:01.050]
Don't have his whole family in rehab.

[00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.870]
I'll tell you that.

[00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:08.630]
Didn't make any comments off mic about devious plans to a deep-six the class size of a man.

[00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:14.290]
See, just based on that alone, there shouldn't be anybody with any common sense be voting for the bushmire today.

[00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:17.230]
Not one except of course for the religious nuts like Ralph Reed and that ilk.

[00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:19.570]
So I have to take away those 10,000 people.

[00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:21.970]
See, they're always exaggerating.

[00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:24.430]
You know, first it was like, there's two million of us around a country.

[00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:28.030]
And then all of a sudden it was like 50 million and then it was 70 million.

[00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:29.270]
And now it's like 400 million.

[00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:34.550]
Of course, there's only 270 million people in the country, but 400 million of them are born again right when Christians, if you believe them.

[00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.090]
Of course, they would never lie either.

[00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:37.050]
Of course, then.

[00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:44.450]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line.

[00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:46.330]
9, 56, at 5, 60, QM.

[00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:46.590]
You know what?

[00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:47.930]

Delicious daily specials and the best best for stromney corn beef and brisket you've ever popped in your puss.

Her bets even has the pickles coast long cucumber salad on the tables, just like the good old days before the old folks put all the other places out of business.

[00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:19.350]

You weigh it, you weigh it.

[00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:59.370]
Time to get it on.

[00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:01.190]

[00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:05.270]

You know that pipe smoke and jizz-guzzle of things rape as funny?

[00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:09.530]
Is that funny?

[00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:09.950]
A game?

[00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:12.050]
Playing scratching at the buildings is funny too, huh?

[00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:13.350]
What? What? What?

[00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:15.310]
What? Since when it's gang raped funny?

[00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:17.690]
Especially when it's me getting my teeth back grabed.

[00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:18.370]
Daaah!

[00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:20.110]
What a jackass!

[00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:22.030]
Hey, how about the curry tea?

[00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:25.330]
Well, no, no, no, don't go tap there so when I talk, this is important.

[00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:26.550]
They don't know comedy.

[00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:27.950]
I'll show them comedy.

[00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:30.510]
Today I brought my collection of laminabne tapes.

[00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:32.470]
Laminabne, you moron!

[00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:34.410]
They even named the restaurant after lumb.

[00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:35.010]
Ah, ah!

[00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:36.650]
Ah, you clueless shmuck.

[00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.810]
We'll get back to that later.

[00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:41.790]

[00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:44.670]
Bring the morning mayor his food.

[00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:45.790]

Ah, here they are.

[00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:50.190]
My favorite place to die.

[00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:51.650]
Zygotsa Buka.

[00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:53.070]
Stiggynavory buddy.

[00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:54.670]
What is it, Shmin?

[00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:56.010]
Looks like a donut.

[00:49:56.010 --> 00:50:00.750]
Looks like the vamed embryos from Planned Parenthood in the hood.

[00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:02.790]
But it's good.

[00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:06.090]
Try it with the cocktail sauce.

[00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:07.490]
Hey, hey beast!

[00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:09.270]
We'll play that Alice Cooper record.

[00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:15.110]
Ten bemen, can't say it's terrible.

[00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:19.630]
There's a little atmosphere for you to help me go down the gullet.

[00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:24.370]
Hey, baby, I really dig that Alice Cooper seed.

[00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:26.650]
I'm with it, and I'm here.

[00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:28.190]
I'm a heapsdove.

[00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:31.330]
To be fun, shall we know what was good?

[00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:36.330]
Yeah, I have some more transcendent here.

[00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:37.430]
Can you tell it this?

[00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:38.510]
Thanks, Mo.

[00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:42.990]
Alright, so we got the meathead mad dog coming up at one.

[00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:45.910]
Followed by that fat jewel right after the quay and the sprick.

[00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.850]
What's that?

[00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.690]
It's a play!

[00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:48.670]
The play!

[00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:51.270]
It's in it right for your ass, Mo.

[00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:52.610]
And all the quay.

[00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:56.370]
Ten, oh two and five sixty WQM happy Tuesday to.

[00:50:56.790 --> 00:51:00.390]
Five, six, seven, oh five sixty pound, five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon line.

[00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:06.770]
Watch it to punishment V for Mohaward David, sucking up to the enemy Fox Sports with that grotesque call to Tony Hyena Bruno yesterday.

[00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:12.070]
Who's Mohaward to David, sixty four, fire is old as fifty five is a catchin' up.

[00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:18.550]
Steel is to paste thirty eight, he gets raped by the whole staff twenty, vanishing from Paradise thirteen.

[00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:23.830]
No penalty gets a gold star in a purple jelly bean seven and he gets raped by freaky Carlos six.

[00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:25.730]
I guess that would be cool on usual punishment.

[00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:29.230]
Well, he does have all those reasons.

[00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:30.370]
WQM.

[00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:32.370]
Oh, Neil?

[00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:33.010]
Yes, sir.

[00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:38.410]
Hi, and finally happened to WQM made the New York Times day.

[00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.890]
Really?

[00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:42.950]
It said, my amuse chance you should post the need to recount.

[00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:45.930]
Now I was listening to Hank and Matt Moore yesterday.

[00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:50.910]
And these people were calling in like death as a crew.

[00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:55.130]
I mean, you know, a nuclear, another nine or eleven.

[00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:58.230]
I mean, because our higher state moves in front.

[00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.910]
Okay, great.

[00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:02.870]
Five, six, seven, oh five sixty pound, five sixty on the AT&T.

[00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:04.850]
Move a little, sense them of that stuff over here.

[00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:07.070]
Whatever it is you do in pal, sense them over here from our birthday.

[00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.430]
WQAM.

[00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:13.270]
Hello?

[00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:14.890]
Hello, Neil?

[00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:15.510]
Yes, sir.

[00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:17.090]
How are you doing today?

[00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:17.610]
Okay.

[00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:27.450]
The only thing better than winning an election as far as your party winning an election is have the other party wine and bitch and complain that it's getting stolen from them.

[00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:32.470]
You know, the reason why the Republicans are going to win this election because more people are voting that way.

[00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:40.070]
And it's a very sick story away to try to justify the fact that more people think like me than think like you.

[00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:46.870]
Oh, in some other words, I hate to break the news to you, but they were like over half a million people more than voted for more than Bush last time in 2000.

[00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:47.550]
How do you like that?

[00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:50.170]
So more people, more people must think like me than you.

[00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:50.730]
How do you like that?

[00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:52.930]
And I love your very mature approach to politics.

[00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:54.890]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's what it is.

[00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:56.110]
Get back in the sandbox, okay?

[00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:58.510]
Before somebody catches you out of it.

[00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:03.550]
More people think like me than you when you know something that's a very sad commentary if it's true.

[00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:05.610]
A very sad commentary.

[00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:06.810]
Mindslaves.

[00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:07.670]
Oh boy.

[00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:10.110]
Absolutely untrue.

[00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:17.030]
The majority of the people in this country are not Bible-totan gunsling and right-wing born again, Armageddon, Hopen, Lunatics.

[00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:20.330]
Because if they were, we wouldn't have a Chinaman's chance.

[00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:27.790]
So I'll confuse this guy with the thousands and thousands of people that were turned away from the polls back in 2000.

[00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:32.190]
Or the many people are going to be disenfranchised today because of the screw-up voting and that doesn't happen.

[00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:33.930]
That's right. Just made it up.

[00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:40.090]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's a typical right-wing response. That's usually their best shot.

[00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:42.210]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:45.110]
Q-A-M.

[00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:46.670]
Is that me?

[00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:47.250]
That's you.

[00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:48.650]
Good morning, sir.

[00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:49.370]
Where is Diaz?

[00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:50.470]
Happy birthday.

[00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:50.930]
Thanks.

[00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:52.630]
Minds in a week.

[00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:54.070]
Well, happy birthday, dear, then.

[00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:54.910]
All right, thanks.

[00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:57.370]
I just got through voting for McBride.

[00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:07.630]
And I was kind of alarmed. I was in the parking lot there walking up to the place and there's these two jet boys out there passing out brochures and stuff.

[00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:08.730]
I thought that was against the law.

[00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:14.610]
It is. It is. I forget what the distances they have to be away from the polling place, but if they were in the parking lot, that's against the law.

[00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:17.850]
Not only in the parking lot, they were about 50 feet from the entrance.

[00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:18.610]
Oh, boy.

[00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:24.310]
Well, thank God we got a good Godfaring righteous Republican governor in there who wouldn't do anything like that.

[00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:27.330]
And would have nothing to do with a Ralph Reed phone calls that we have.

[00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:30.390]
And by the way, I was the only guy there that spoke English.

[00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:32.110]
Ah, not good news.

[00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:34.750]
All right. Have a good one.

[00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:35.710]
Better go back and vote again.

[00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.670]
I think I will.

[00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:36.990]
Thanks.

[00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:38.250]
Let's see.

[00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:39.210]
What difference does it make?

[00:54:39.350 --> 00:54:40.570]
He sure isn't listening to you in the morning.

[00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:41.670]
Why should he listen to you?

[00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:43.050]
What does that mean?

[00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:45.850]
What does this facts mean?

[00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:48.250]
What difference does it make?

[00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:49.370]
He sure isn't listening to you.

[00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:53.150]
Oh, this is Jerry who gave up with a handwriting and now he's typing it.

[00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:55.430]
I think about the promo.

[00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:56.910]
I guess I don't know.

[00:54:57.070 --> 00:54:58.110]
You have to be a little more explicit.

[00:54:58.330 --> 00:54:58.730]
Okay, Jerry.

[00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:02.570]
And go back to the handwriting with so much more colorful, so much more retarded.

[00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:08.510]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:09.810]
But you are, Jerry.

[00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.510]
You are listening.

[00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:11.750]
How do you like that?

[00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:12.770]
Like you do every day.

[00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:15.030]
WQAM.

[00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.550]
Hello.

[00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:17.110]
Yes, sir.

[00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:19.330]
Yeah, I have a big report.

[00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:19.990]
Yeah.

[00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.790]
Next to the warning vote.

[00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:22.950]
What is it?

[00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:25.030]
There's a police.

[00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:26.410]
About 10 cars on the way.

[00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:28.710]
It's about 10 of them on a motorcycle.

[00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:31.270]
So, next to the warning vote, in sugar sin and bokeh.

[00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.990]
Never been there.

[00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:33.950]
Exactly.

[00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:35.350]
Okay, thanks for the good news.

[00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:36.010]
Thanks for the warning.

[00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:40.690]
All you dark folks, you better get out there and vote while it's still daylight.

[00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:41.070]
Okay.

[00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:43.850]
Otherwise, they'll probably declare a curfew around 530.

[00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:49.750]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:51.110]
And let me sit again.

[00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:52.950]
Look at the electoral map from the year 2000.

[00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:54.530]
Look at the living and breathing states.

[00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:56.290]
The civilized places in this country.

[00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:00.190]
From the west coast to the northeast, even to the Midwest.

[00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:05.690]
All you do is look at the Yahoo states, the Mugwump states, the nose picking,

[00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:07.270]
Trader Trash states.

[00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:10.370]
Just take a look at the old red and blue.

[00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:13.610]
Okay, and you'll see who thinks like that, Assela, called about four or five calls back.

[00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:15.770]
That guy.

[00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.270]

[00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:19.010]
WQAM.

[00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:20.730]
Yo.

[00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:21.510]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.550]
Hey.

[00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:23.310]

[00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:26.650]
You're comfortable to get to the president.

[00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:27.470]
Yeah, I am.

[00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:30.750]
And you stand, you know, Democrat, man.

[00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:33.490]
They got to make up something because they know they're going to lose.

[00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:35.830]
Yeah, okay, listen, your sheep's getting lonely.

[00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:36.890]
Okay, better get back home.

[00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:39.270]
Got to make something up.

[00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:40.350]
See, this is what you're dealing with.

[00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:40.950]
Morons.

[00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:43.530]
People with collective IQ are smaller than their shoe size.

[00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:47.950]
I mean, you can vote anyway you like, but the, the, the approach.

[00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:52.770]
The intellectual approach to your political leanings is so, so mature.

[00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:53.670]
That's what I love.

[00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:56.490]
These Democrats are going to make up a bunch of crap.

[00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:59.170]
Sir, you have a good time.

[00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:00.150]
You in the Jebster, okay?

[00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:05.790]
And the 80, 80 people in your kids class, if by some fate of luck you should mind of reproducing God forbid.

[00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:08.910]
10.08 at 560 WQAM.

[00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.570]
And don't forget.

[00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:13.830]
You never know who will call Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:20.110]
I'm not saying you don't need the sheep as plug, but I listen to you guys every day.

[00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:21.330]
You guys are doing a hell of a job.

[00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:22.930]
It's fun listening to and all Brian.

[00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:24.770]
I mean, the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:25.210]
What?

[00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:26.530]
Did I hear that right?

[00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:27.450]
Back up the tape.

[00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:30.030]
If I listen to you guys every day, you guys are doing a hell of a job.

[00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:31.610]
It's fun listening to and all Brian.

[00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:33.450]
I mean, the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:38.570]
Wow, even Mohawar David listens to Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:40.170]
Here's an incredible fact.

[00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:41.170]
Wait till you're there's neil.

[00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:43.810]
I can't believe what happened to me this morning after an hour and a half and a half.

[00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:54.330]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:54.370]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:54.370]

[00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:54.370]

[00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:54.710]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:55.650]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:56.370]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:57:56.370 --> 00:57:57.370]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:58.070]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:57:58.070 --> 00:57:58.710]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:00.430]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:02.070]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:03.670]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:05.130]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:08.290]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:09.630]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:13.790]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:19.190]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:21.470]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.490]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:21.490]

[00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:21.490]

[00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:21.650]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:22.610]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:23.870]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:25.630]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:27.270]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:28.450]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:30.630]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:33.350]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:35.590]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:39.650]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:40.730]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:43.730]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:45.350]
Maybe the Virgin Mary tapped on their window.

[00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:48.710]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:49.090]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:49.090]

[00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:49.110]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:58:49.110 --> 00:58:49.250]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:49.930]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.990]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:53.470]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:53.870]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.990]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:56.190]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:57.270]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:59.230]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:01.150]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:04.170]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:05.670]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:06.730]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:59:06.830 --> 00:59:06.950]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:07.430]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:10.130]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

[00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:11.650]
Maybe they saw the burning bush.

5-6-560.

[01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:52.530]
The radio's on your phone.

[01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:54.690]
Q-A-N.

[01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:57.150]
The sucks.

[01:00:57.390 --> 01:01:00.210]
Have in-app-delection officials left you confused.

[01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:04.010]
Here is your guide to understanding how to cast your vote.

[01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:06.190]
In Palm Beach County, Florida.

[01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:09.790]
Follow along with me to see just how easy it can be.

[01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:11.470]
Let's get started.

[01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:12.130]
Shall we?

[01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:13.610]
Joining me here in Florida.

[01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:13.610]

[01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:13.610]

[01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:15.210]
The booth is Mr. Murmelsd.

[01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:16.990]
Who are you voting for?

[01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:18.230]
I'll leave him in.

[01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.830]
You'll see.

[01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:21.210]
Now, read the butterfly ballet.

[01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:23.390]
Starting with Bush-Cady and the left column.

[01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:25.710]
You can't enchickel Gruber, Bangala,

[01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:27.270]
Ithman and Gerbels in the right.

[01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:28.770]
Where's I'll leave him in?

[01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:29.290]
Over there.

[01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:30.470]
Disgubles guy.

[01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:30.770]
Yes?

[01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:33.290]
Is this guy who makes my baby food?

[01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:33.870]
No.

[01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:39.310]
Now simply punch a hole in the 1959 Univac Key Punch Guide.

[01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:40.910]
Over there.

[01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:41.430]
Here.

[01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:42.990]
Use this microscope.

[01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:44.170]
Oh, there.

[01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:45.230]
Is that it?

[01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:45.410]
No.

[01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:47.150]
Okay, I'll punch again.

[01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:48.350]
Is this it?

[01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:48.610]
No.

[01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.230]
No.

[01:01:49.450 --> 01:01:50.770]
That invalidates your vote.

[01:01:51.090 --> 01:01:51.750]
All right, here.

[01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:52.390]
I'll punch again.

[01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.810]
I'll punch again.

[01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:54.490]
Do that again.

[01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:55.250]
I'll punch you.

[01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.470]

[01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.470]

[01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:58.150]
Shhh!

[01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.850]
Alright.

[01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:01.730]
Duttering old heave.

[01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:05.290]
Remember comrades, if you want to live in Florida.

[01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:09.030]
Exercise your right to vote in accordance to the little brother.

[01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:12.250]
1016-560 WQM.

[01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:13.990]
I'll tell you that Matt sludge she don't miss anything.

[01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:16.290]
Just off the press.

[01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:18.230]
Matt drudgerport.

[01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:21.190]
A voter is a Florida voters claim machines broken voted for McBride.

[01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.890]
Marked his bush.

[01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:24.710]
I voted from McBride, but the machine counted it as bush.

[01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:25.830]
I did this three times.

[01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:28.930]
The polling worker finally said we have to reprogram this machine.

[01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:30.990]
Another person was having the same trouble while I was there.

[01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:35.050]
So came to call it a South Florida's WQAM and the highly weighted radio top match.

[01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:36.030]
The Elijah show.

[01:02:37.330 --> 01:02:39.850]
I'll tell you right now this election is fixed, Rod Rogers.

[01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:42.430]
Who's been in the Miami Fort Lauderdale market for more than 30 years.

[01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:46.270]
Based on a few early calls, it's going to be a wild wild time.

[01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:47.810]
He said said, fat old Neil.

[01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:49.810]
There was no official confirmation on the alleged tech trick.

[01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:53.170]
Touch screen and other high tech voting machines make their full scale debut today.

[01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:56.810]
Mid-state poll problems have been reported at least three polling locations.

[01:02:57.610 --> 01:03:00.810]
Local six news reported that the scanners were not working at the central Florida.

[01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:02.370]
A growth of precinct.

[01:03:02.370 --> 01:03:04.070]
I thought that said gotcha for just a second.

[01:03:04.070 --> 01:03:05.950]
Go with a precinct 101 in Orange County.

[01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:08.850]
Voters were putting their ballots in a box to be hand counted according to the report.

[01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:12.710]
The scanners also were not working at the Port Saint John precinct 159 in Brevard County.

[01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:14.550]
Or precinct 116 in San Olc County.

[01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:16.370]
They say Albans Church on St. David Fort 26.

[01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:18.590]
According to reports, it's a state where we can't do an election.

[01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:21.230]
We can't hold an election here.

[01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:26.030]
In this goddamn God forsaken state in this penis you learn which we live.

[01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:27.830]
What a disgrace.

[01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:30.610]
You ain't see nothing yet.

[01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:32.050]
It's not even 1030 in the morning yet.

[01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:35.770]
This is going to be one of the great messes of all time.

[01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:39.230]
And they're going to say, and you're going to have these whining people just like couple we've had already.

[01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:41.130]
Oh, that's right. Just claim fix.

[01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:43.310]
Yeah, these people are just making it up right.

[01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:47.290]
Just like they did two years ago.

[01:03:47.410 --> 01:03:51.090]
And that's why we went for weeks and weeks with all those people holding up the ballots looking for the chance.

[01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:54.130]
That one guy looked like the eye was going to pop the eyeball out of his socket.

[01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:57.090]
That would judge WQAM.

[01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.510]
QAM.

[01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:04.630]
Going once.

[01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:05.750]
Going twice.

[01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.630]
Hello.

[01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:07.410]
Yes, sir.

[01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:08.730]
Good afternoon.

[01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:09.410]
Good evening.

[01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:10.070]
Excuse me.

[01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.290]
Huh?

[01:04:10.790 --> 01:04:12.070]
What do you think, man?

[01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:13.710]
Voted this morning.

[01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:16.610]
Did you get them?

[01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:17.370]
Have you voted yet?

[01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:18.690]
I didn't catch the beginning of the show.

[01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:19.130]
Not yet.

[01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:19.990]
Okay.

[01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:20.830]
The machine.

[01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:26.990]
So they send us over and you walk up to the machine and they have one of the members from a century village.

[01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:28.990]
They have this little box thing.

[01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:31.350]
I don't know if you're familiar with the new voting thing.

[01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:33.930]
And it resets and he walks away with this.

[01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:39.750]
They give you a little yellow printed piece of paper that you hand to this guy so he can set you.

[01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:42.830]
There's no real numbers or demarcation on it or anything.

[01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:45.070]
And you go through.

[01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:46.990]
I didn't have any problems with the machine.

[01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:51.730]
There was no really a long line over in sunrise off Nophill.

[01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:56.890]
But it allows you to review the ballot and everything like that.

[01:04:57.950 --> 01:05:00.130]
But again, they just can't.

[01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:01.030]
All of that.

[01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:02.730]
They can't provide a receipt.

[01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:07.230]
As you were saying, the fix has been in the fix is in.

[01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:10.270]
And all these malfunctioning machines.

[01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:17.590]
What I'm voting, I hear some of these poll workers say, you didn't match the pink with the yellow.

[01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:19.190]
You haven't been matching the pink.

[01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:24.450]
I'm sitting there and I turned to my wife and I said, oh, Matt.

[01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:26.430]
Because we've been talking about it for a while.

[01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:27.490]
I said, oh, boy.

[01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:35.530]
And you finish voting and they've got this little flashing red light that flashes vote, vote, vote on the top of the.

[01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:37.930]
And I turned to the guy and said, is this flashing red?

[01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:39.830]
And he said, yep, that sends it in.

[01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:42.950]
And I said, oh, you know, I can't say it on the air.

[01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:48.770]
But I said, right, and I said, you know, and I said, I announced, you know,

[01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:53.410]
if we could just get a receipt, he says, I can give you one of these little stickers as a receipt.

[01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:55.170]
The voting stickers.

[01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:56.050]
Yeah, I voted, yeah.

[01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:57.770]
I just walked out laughing now.

[01:05:58.310 --> 01:05:59.430]
Well, good luck to us, pal.

[01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:01.450]
I ain't crying, you know, but I got a laugh.

[01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:02.170]
I'll see it.

[01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:02.930]
I'll see you in Mississippi.

[01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:04.090]
See it Amsterdam.

[01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:04.510]
Okay.

[01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:05.730]
What's the scenes?

[01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:07.050]
20 past 10.

[01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:07.970]
I ain't looking good, folks.

[01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:13.110]
And of course, anybody that's dubious about some of the stuff we're hearing, I'll let you remind you on the same program back two years ago.

[01:06:13.110 --> 01:06:18.050]
We were hearing women calling in from Palm Beach County and others calling in people who were hysterical.

[01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:24.330]
We were not sure they wanted to vote for a goal, but they thought, you know, something I think I'm out of voted by Buchanan because of that goddamn butterfly ballot.

[01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:25.650]
And lo and behold, they did.

[01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:27.890]
They did.

[01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:29.910]
And that's where we heard about it first right here on this show.

[01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:34.670]
Because this state does, in fact, I don't know about the rest of the states.

[01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:35.530]
I can't speak for that.

[01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:39.210]
But it seems to me, didn't California use the touchscreen?

[01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:41.670]
I think they've been using that for quite a while now.

[01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:42.690]
Lots of places have, yes.

[01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:43.010]
Yeah.

[01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:45.090]
Without any major problem at all.

[01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:47.990]
They've been touching it.

[01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:49.470]
But that ain't Florida.

[01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:50.950]
That ain't Florida, baby.

[01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:52.170]
No place ain't Florida.

[01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:54.430]
This is a special place.

[01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:56.710]
And you assholes, they're on CNN.

[01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:57.530]
You better get with it.

[01:06:57.570 --> 01:06:59.770]
Okay, this bill Humper was sitting around thinking it's a big joke.

[01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:01.530]
Yuckin' it up with it in the beginning, you know.

[01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:03.550]
But I mean, you better get with it.

[01:07:03.830 --> 01:07:07.170]
You better send your people out to these polling places and see what kind of crap is going down.

[01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:09.350]
And let me also say this to you.

[01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:11.010]
All you partisan clowns out there.

[01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:12.490]
I don't care who wins.

[01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:13.370]
It's still fixed.

[01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:15.170]
It's still rigged.

[01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:16.930]
I don't care if McBride wins via a million votes.

[01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:19.270]
Or if Bush wins via two minutes, it's fixed.

[01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:21.390]
Release the attempt.

[01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:22.430]
Let's put it this way.

[01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:23.570]
The attempt is being made.

[01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:24.210]
Big time.

[01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:28.970]
They could show old Dick Daly and Chicago a thing or two of these people, a lot of fixing the election.

[01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:30.290]
I mean, they had nothing on them.

[01:07:30.290 --> 01:07:31.830]
He had nothing on them with the dead people voting.

[01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:33.650]
We've been doing that in Dave County for years.

[01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:36.510]
W.D.C.Y.M.

[01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:38.050]
No, no.

[01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:40.810]
Good morning and happy birthday.

[01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:41.730]
Thank you.

[01:07:42.210 --> 01:07:48.810]
As a maybe a sign of things to come, there was somebody accelerating over here above FIU,

[01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:50.410]
they're running Jeb.

[01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:54.210]
And within 10 minutes, cloud cover covered it all up.

[01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:55.570]
So, see it's an act of God.

[01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:56.730]
I'll tell you that right now.

[01:07:56.850 --> 01:07:57.970]
Maybe they're going to sign.

[01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:58.770]
It's a sign.

[01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:59.450]
Yes, it is.

[01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:03.630]
I went earlier this morning, Neil, to a devote and had no problems.

[01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:06.570]
There was about, because I got there early about five minutes to seven.

[01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:08.590]
Those were about 25 people ahead of me.

[01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:10.310]
They were very organized.

[01:08:11.030 --> 01:08:13.830]
They got everybody in and I was in an out and 18 minutes.

[01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:17.510]
And my vote for Mr. McBride and hopefully he'll win.

[01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:19.390]
Okay, Bill.

[01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.930]
I didn't have any problems.

[01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:20.690]
Good luck to us.

[01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:21.550]
All right, buddy.

[01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:21.950]
Thanks.

[01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:24.450]
Here's the fact that it says, kind of bizarre, what is this?

[01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:25.290]
It says, Happy Birthday.

[01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:26.630]
I'm sorry, McBride is not going to win.

[01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:27.130]
I'm in Texas.

[01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:30.070]
When I vote a Democrat across the board this morning, the polling station kept saying,

[01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.590]
are you sure?

[01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:31.650]
Every time I enter to vote.

[01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:35.590]
I think the closest Democratic candidates, at least 10 points behind,

[01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:38.090]
when they find out that I'm a Democrat, will be tend to get there a lot of here.

[01:08:38.190 --> 01:08:39.090]
Unfortunately, I can't do that.

[01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:42.950]
So I'm going to try to blend in and I'm off to buy some guns and maybe even buy me a dead feed of sign.

[01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:47.330]
If you can't beat him, join him because as you and I both know, Republicans don't like people to interview with them.

[01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:48.870]
Just join the flock, baby.

[01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:50.290]
Once again, Happy Birthday.

[01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:51.170]
Thank you so much.

[01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:53.350]
When it out, join the flock.

[01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:56.610]
Here's Steve, as I voted in, baby this morning.

[01:08:56.730 --> 01:08:57.510]
Very large crowd.

[01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:59.290]
Only 30 minutes, I think I'll go vote again.

[01:08:59.370 --> 01:09:00.330]
This might be the last election.

[01:09:00.730 --> 01:09:02.150]
Don't like seeing that a big crowd in, baby.

[01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:03.030]
That's not a good sign.

[01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.410]
Oh, yeah.

[01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.970]
You think?

[01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:07.430]
You think?

[01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:08.650]
Never.

[01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:13.450]
Yes, here's the fact that says, did you know that Colin Powell's Jamaican, yes, I did, as a matter of fact.

[01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:19.950]
And also, Saudi say, will not help any U.S. threat on Iraq, which is an old story from days ago, which we talked about.

[01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.830]
But thank you very much anyway.

[01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:21.490]
And we know those things.

[01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:22.450]
Thank you anyway.

[01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:24.070]
Keep your out of trouble off the streets.

[01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:26.250]
5-6-7-0-5-60.

[01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:30.630]
5-6-7-0-5-60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:33.250]
Who's more Howard David is leading our poll with 81?

[01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:35.270]
Fire is old, A-75.

[01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:36.830]
Steelers 2 pay's got 51.

[01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:38.130]
2 pay's, I'm sorry.

[01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:38.630]
plural.

[01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:41.210]
He gets raked in by the whole staff 26.

[01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:44.050]
Vanishing from Paradise 26.

[01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:45.910]
16, I'm sorry.

[01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:48.250]
No penalty gets a gold start in purple jelly bean 15.

[01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:51.490]
And he gets raked in by freaking Carlos only 8.

[01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:53.870]
So even this audience knows as cruel as they usually are.

[01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:56.490]
That's very, that's way over the edge.

[01:09:56.710 --> 01:09:58.990]
Constitu, even with this Supreme Court, they never permit that.

[01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:01.530]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.670]
Neil.

[01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:03.510]
Yes, I am.

[01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:06.950]
I want to wish you a happy and healthy birthday.

[01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:07.790]
I love you.

[01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.330]
Thank you.

[01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:11.150]
I love you from the 70s when I lived in Aventura.

[01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:13.810]
But now I live in Boquer, California.

[01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:14.310]
Oh, boy.

[01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:18.190]
And I want to tell you I was in one of those disputed precincts with the butterflies.

[01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:20.670]
But I was there this morning.

[01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:22.710]
Everything is fabulous.

[01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:25.450]
There were some AKs there.

[01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:27.010]
You know, what can you do with the ass?

[01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:27.430]
Hi.

[01:10:28.710 --> 01:10:32.530]
But there were qualified people to show, like this one lady said,

[01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:34.190]
I don't even have an ATM card.

[01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:36.670]
Well, anyway, they showed her how to use it.

[01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:37.430]
No problem.

[01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:39.790]
I was in and out of there in 20 minutes.

[01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:42.530]
And of course, you know how I voted.

[01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:44.030]
I want to tell you something.

[01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:46.490]
I hope Matt Dreck is still listening.

[01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:47.250]
I'm sure he is.

[01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:48.590]
He's glued to it in the radio too.

[01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:53.630]
And this is the most obnoxious human being on the airways.

[01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:54.690]
He beats him all.

[01:10:54.810 --> 01:10:56.910]
You know the facts, people, everything.

[01:10:57.210 --> 01:10:57.370]
Yeah.

[01:10:57.470 --> 01:11:00.170]
And you gave her good last week, the facts lady.

[01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:04.050]
But I want to tell you one thing, Neil, about this entire election,

[01:11:04.050 --> 01:11:05.270]
because I am a junkie.

[01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:07.070]
I watch everything.

[01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:13.250]
The worst, the worst attack ads are taking place in the state of Georgia.

[01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:14.230]
Got it, no.

[01:11:14.230 --> 01:11:19.130]
And I got bad news for a Cleveland's fallen behind now.

[01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:20.850]
My heart is breaking.

[01:11:21.170 --> 01:11:24.750]
I mean, this guy, he gave up two legs and an arm with his country.

[01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:26.830]
If he would have given up the other arm, we might like him.

[01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:28.610]
But he still got that one arm left, yeah.

[01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:30.050]
He's not a patriot.

[01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:30.530]
No.

[01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:31.950]
This is what they really do.

[01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:34.010]
If he was a true patriot, he'd given us the other arm too.

[01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:35.890]
Yeah.

[01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:38.710]
Well, you know, they really breaks my heart.

[01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:40.930]
You know, this morning, I'm see span.

[01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:43.930]
There was a question, when did you decide how you're going to vote?

[01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:46.470]
Well, I kept calling and calling couldn't get on,

[01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:47.970]
because I was going to tell him I was five.

[01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:50.610]
Why was I five years old?

[01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:52.930]
Because my mother cried when Franklin Roosevelt won.

[01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:58.190]
Because of how lucky we were, he was going to pull us out of this garbage we were in.

[01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:03.010]
And that's when I became a Democrat, because it were for the people.

[01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:04.810]
And that's all I can say.

[01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:06.710]
The people got the money who are panace, right?

[01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:09.030]
Yeah. The Republicans, they don't give it down.

[01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:11.690]
That ad in Georgia is killing me.

[01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:12.930]
It is absolutely...

[01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:14.990]
Almost makes you glad you live in Florida, but not quite.

[01:12:16.190 --> 01:12:20.270]
Oh, I think we have to make two states out of this state.

[01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:21.790]
I said that for a long time.

[01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:22.930]
No flaw in self-file.

[01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:24.530]
You're old, the friend that died.

[01:12:24.690 --> 01:12:26.550]
What's his name, you know?

[01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:27.510]
Old what's his name, yeah.

[01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:29.910]
That was on WJNL.

[01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:31.490]
He used to talk about that.

[01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:32.970]
We really should have two states.

[01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:34.030]
They've got two Carolina.

[01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:35.130]
Okay, have a great day, sweetheart.

[01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:36.750]
Happy birthday, I love you.

[01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:37.630]
Say goodbye, bye-bye.

[01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:41.190]
Once he starts talking about Jack Cole, then we know it's definitely long past time.

[01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:42.230]
To say goodbye.

[01:12:42.850 --> 01:12:46.750]
26 past 10 at 560 WQA and Tom Lehman would like to say hello to you.

[01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:51.690]
He loves the people listening to the show, which is why he created that Neil Rogers deal in the first place at Halop Pontiac.

[01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:55.530]
Saved gigantic humongous bucks right now in all Pontiacs and GM season stock.

[01:12:55.930 --> 01:12:58.750]
Just tell him that you heard this spot on the Neil Rogers show and they'll do like a little dance.

[01:12:58.930 --> 01:13:00.850]
They'll do a kazansky right in the showroom for you.

[01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:01.490]
They'll be so excited.

[01:13:02.050 --> 01:13:08.270]

[01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:10.510]

[01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:12.090]
You'll find out it's not the lowest price.

Halop's all-segaed has always a dependable selection of pre-owned cars, trucks and SUVs.

[01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:31.330]
And like I always say, each and every day because they pay us to do it.

[01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:37.350]
If somebody turns you down for credit, if you can't couldn't deal any other car dealer in the universe, if everybody else looks at you and says, who the hell are you kidding?

[01:13:37.730 --> 01:13:39.230]
No problem in a hell of they'll make you a deal.

And what did I tell you?

[01:14:10.330 --> 01:14:12.570]
You don't talk to Lysa, you can talk.

[01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:13.750]
This is the beast.

[01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:15.510]
I said shut up, fatso.

[01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:16.770]
But you're like a father to me.

[01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:18.770]
You don't talk to Lom Don't Talking.

[01:14:19.050 --> 01:14:20.750]

[01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:21.570]
Okay, I'll...

[01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:22.310]

No both of you.

[01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:10.710]

[01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:13.890]
No one knew in the blau, but that's so pretty.

[01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:14.770]
Okay.

[01:15:15.330 --> 01:15:16.470]

You know who I am?

[01:15:17.730 --> 01:15:19.470]
No, come in, then don't think it up now.

[01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:20.630]
Come here, bloody beast.

[01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:21.370]

[01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:23.790]
But I expect a print in the poetry of Mike.

[01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:26.710]

How can it help you?

[01:15:41.490 --> 01:15:42.230]
Oh, you see Warden?

[01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:42.730]
Yeah.

[01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:43.810]
Keep getting raped.

[01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:44.710]
Do.

[01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:46.050]
He's a vatish.

[01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:48.150]
Jack, look into it right away.

[01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:48.890]
Thanks, Warden.

[01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:49.710]
It's about time.

[01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:53.810]
I said drop your pants.

[01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:55.850]

Big shot.

[01:16:03.230 --> 01:16:03.450]
Oh.

[01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:09.510]
Yes, now we pass the time away in the G.O.J.L.A.S.

[01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:12.150]
That's 33 at 5.60 WQAM.

[01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:14.830]
State to decide if idiots can vote.

[01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:16.450]
Well, we already decided that in Florida.

[01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:19.690]
New Mexico voters will decide today whether they want it or not.

[01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:17.170]

[01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:19.510]
It is a chairs-machine stance on organizing this supply of

[01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.970]
out Florida.

[01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:22.970]
You're calling from Kansas City?

[01:18:23.230 --> 01:18:29.010]
Yes, I program those touch tone screens for four companies in the past based on a

[01:18:29.010 --> 01:18:29.950]
slot machine card.

[01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:32.790]
Somebody can go in, replace that slot machine card.

[01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:36.230]

Are you familiar with your slot machines down there?

[01:18:43.410 --> 01:18:46.530]
Why did I just tell you ask me the first time and I said no, we still don't.

[01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:47.870]
Since you asked me, we still don't.

[01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:48.650]
Okay, you don't have.

[01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:49.770]
Well, let me say it again.

[01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:50.670]
No, we don't have them.

[01:18:50.710 --> 01:18:51.190]
Okay, Neil.

[01:18:51.610 --> 01:18:53.730]
Those machines down there are all fault.

[01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:54.850]
I could walk into the corner.

[01:18:54.850 --> 01:18:56.430]
Listen, Reverend Jones, have a nice day.

[01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.910]
5670560.

[01:18:59.130 --> 01:19:00.630]
Do you have slot machines down here, George?

[01:19:01.210 --> 01:19:01.710]
Let me look.

[01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.890]
I found a slot.

[01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:06.690]
Oh, there's a machine.

[01:19:10.770 --> 01:19:13.250]
See, I'm not going to get excited about it because what's the use, you know?

[01:19:13.930 --> 01:19:14.390]
Let's see.

[01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:16.290]
Matt, this is, this is brilliant.

[01:19:16.690 --> 01:19:20.250]
Matt Rudge is obviously monitoring your show on the Dredgey report he has the main article

[01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:20.710]
about color.

[01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:22.350]
I just got through reading that.

[01:19:22.450 --> 01:19:23.870]
We just got through talking about that.

[01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:25.310]
What is wrong with some of you people?

[01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:27.530]
If you listen to the show, you know what was going on here.

[01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:29.270]
Matt Rudge, listen to this.

[01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:30.010]
He's not monitoring.

[01:19:30.150 --> 01:19:31.390]
He's a big fan of the show.

[01:19:31.690 --> 01:19:35.150]
It's fight of his protestations and it's sometime in Coherent Call like the one last week,

[01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:38.370]
where she must have, like I said, didn't get his trick or treat for Halloween.

[01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:40.110]
And she had her teeth in a ringer.

[01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:41.650]
Miss Dredge.

[01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:44.290]
Maybe somebody forgot to change her panties.

[01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:45.230]
I don't know what her problem was.

[01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:47.030]
But anyway, yeah, we already read that.

[01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:48.110]
Okay, we know it.

[01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:51.290]
I guess what I heard Matt Rudge is.

[01:19:53.130 --> 01:19:55.070]
See, they got his name on the show four times already.

[01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:57.030]
Well, an awful lot of people want to be on the show.

[01:19:57.230 --> 01:19:57.550]
I'll tell you that.

[01:19:57.630 --> 01:19:58.690]
It must be starting to get important.

[01:19:59.390 --> 01:20:02.610]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:04.590]
Let's hear some reports about the voting today.

[01:20:04.930 --> 01:20:06.070]
And if you want, make some up.

[01:20:06.170 --> 01:20:06.530]
We don't care.

[01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:08.610]
Screw up all the rest of the media.

[01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:09.570]
Just make up some stuff.

[01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:12.710]
It'll be on CNN and MSNBC.

[01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:16.330]
I mean, certainly on Fox because they're monitoring religiously now.

[01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:19.810]
How you doing, Heather?

[01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.750]
W-Q-I-M.

[01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:23.870]
George wants Heather's number by the way.

[01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.230]
Yes, sir.

[01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:25.090]
Happy birthday, sir.

[01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:25.890]
Thank you.

[01:20:26.050 --> 01:20:27.370]
According to one color before,

[01:20:27.610 --> 01:20:30.490]
it's jet down South Miami or wherever it was.

[01:20:30.850 --> 01:20:34.350]
The SkyWider was doing the same thing up in Hollywood area.

[01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:34.950]
And yes, what?

[01:20:35.170 --> 01:20:36.170]
Covered up by clouds after just coming in.

[01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:37.230]
Covered up by clouds.

[01:20:37.450 --> 01:20:38.050]
How do you like that?

[01:20:38.050 --> 01:20:38.890]
Oh, right.

[01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:41.610]
The Lord don't want to see no Jev in the sky.

[01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:46.230]
I do have to also concur with the guy who factored you about the problems with one candidate

[01:20:46.230 --> 01:20:46.650]
appearing.

[01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:48.150]
I had the same problem.

[01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:48.690]
No.

[01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:49.130]
Yes.

[01:20:49.730 --> 01:20:50.450]
I run Hollywood.

[01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:52.430]
We make holdover.

[01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:53.670]
I sit to the pole.

[01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:55.490]
Hey, there's something's not right here.

[01:20:55.770 --> 01:20:56.730]
I voted for McBride.

[01:20:57.370 --> 01:20:59.230]
And what did come up showing?

[01:20:59.570 --> 01:21:00.210]
I showed Bush.

[01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:02.250]
You voted for McBride.

[01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:03.890]
And the machine showed you voted for Bush?

[01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.230]
Yes.

[01:21:04.690 --> 01:21:05.850]
And I'm like, this is my right side.

[01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:06.890]
I'll go review.

[01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:07.870]
This is review ballot.

[01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:08.570]
Go correct.

[01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:09.010]
No.

[01:21:09.230 --> 01:21:09.510]
Same thing.

[01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:11.290]
I'm like, oh crap.

[01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:12.890]
I called the pole worker.

[01:21:13.050 --> 01:21:13.590]
I said, look at this.

[01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:14.590]
I showed it to her.

[01:21:15.230 --> 01:21:17.390]
And she said, she said, oh my God.

[01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:18.250]
I can't believe it.

[01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:21.450]
So, thankfully there was a technician there and they reset the machine.

[01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:22.190]
They shut it off.

[01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:23.070]
Then they reset it.

[01:21:23.850 --> 01:21:24.750]
And they turned it on.

[01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:25.350]
And it worked.

[01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:27.590]
Well, what if they hadn't reset it?

[01:21:27.670 --> 01:21:29.550]
What if you wouldn't have checked it and wouldn't have noticed that?

[01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:30.870]
I wonder how many people already voted.

[01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:31.550]
You want to have a space cadet?

[01:21:31.730 --> 01:21:32.270]
Yeah, right.

[01:21:32.770 --> 01:21:35.330]
I would have told them I want to vote on another machine or something.

[01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:37.330]
I could not believe it.

[01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:39.150]
I don't think the people might have voted on that.

[01:21:39.150 --> 01:21:43.890]
If there's anybody in this state who thinks that these machines are working properly and

[01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:47.290]
forget about the outcome, if anybody thinks we're going to get an accurate outcome in this

[01:21:47.290 --> 01:21:50.870]
election, man, I got a whole bunch of land to study right behind my ass.

[01:21:51.730 --> 01:21:52.110]
Oh, bye.

[01:21:52.370 --> 01:21:52.450]
No.

[01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:55.190]
I was just incredulous.

[01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.110]
I'm like, oh crap.

[01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:58.690]
Bill, do we have to get through this again?

[01:21:58.830 --> 01:21:58.970]
Yes.

[01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:03.470]
Anyone, Neil, thanks for being the voice of the reason and Jesse Ventura for Governor.

[01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:05.590]
Oh, forget about that.

[01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:06.770]
Jesse Ventura for Governor.

[01:22:07.410 --> 01:22:07.890]
That asshole.

[01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:10.770]
Well, no, he's an asshole.

[01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:11.730]
Oh, no, he's an asshole.

[01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:12.330]

[01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:13.730]
Did you see that?

[01:22:13.730 --> 01:22:16.170]
And first of all, that whole tone of his word, he's talking.

[01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:18.470]
I'm so tired of that stale phony act.

[01:22:18.650 --> 01:22:22.270]
You know, for a moment there, he gave us a brief glimmer and he talked about the God, people

[01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:22.990]
being full of crap.

[01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:25.590]
And we thought, oh, here's a guy that's got the balls to say something.

[01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:30.150]
And then all of a sudden, well, you know, he realized it wasn't politically correct and he

[01:22:30.150 --> 01:22:31.650]
liked you and he heard too much from him.

[01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:36.370]
And then in a fit of peak, I mean, so what if they didn't like the way they had the God damn ceremony?

[01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:38.090]
Well, what does that have to do with anything?

[01:22:38.150 --> 01:22:42.170]
Is that the reason to conduct politics and conduct government in this country because you didn't

[01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:44.810]
like to wait somebody had a memorial service and it became a pet rally?

[01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:45.370]
So what?

[01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:46.430]
You didn't like it.

[01:22:46.630 --> 01:22:47.450]
You got up and walked out.

[01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:48.070]
He's entitled.

[01:22:49.210 --> 01:22:55.510]
So he, this clown that he appointed interim senator yesterday, Minnesota, this guy didn't know until an hour before.

[01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:59.610]
He called him an hour before it said, get out of your jeans and put on a suit.

[01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:00.430]
You better get over here.

[01:23:00.610 --> 01:23:02.110]
You're going to be the next senator for two weeks.

[01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:05.030]
Just an a fit of peak.

[01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:09.910]
Hey, Jesse, back to the rain, baby.

[01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:12.190]
And you know, rock, I'll take it at that right now.

[01:23:12.690 --> 01:23:13.470]
Jesse for governor.

[01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:16.430]
I'd rather have jab at least.

[01:23:16.650 --> 01:23:18.350]
At least he's got a fun family anyway.

[01:23:19.690 --> 01:23:19.850]
Huh?

[01:23:21.170 --> 01:23:21.950]
It's a laugh.

[01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:24.130]
I've admitted it's another great story every week, okay?

[01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:26.530]
And it is getting close to Christmas time, summer.

[01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:29.590]
Next month, be December, while I'll be singing the first and the last no end.

[01:23:30.730 --> 01:23:31.990]
I'm not even more.

[01:23:32.690 --> 01:23:34.470]
This is sports radio by City.

[01:23:34.890 --> 01:23:35.890]
You way up.

[01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:39.330]
Bush, bitch, the moon!

[01:23:40.190 --> 01:23:45.570]
Come and listen to my story about a man named John, whose wallet was as big as his face he swore to have had.

[01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:50.750]
He became a governor and dictator too, simply by having more money than you.

[01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:55.650]
Fully in there that is, dirty deals, ex-presidential dad.

[01:23:56.450 --> 01:23:59.430]
In a real, guber, guber, night, toriel, raised.

[01:23:59.770 --> 01:24:04.710]
The other guber's name was buddy, and the K had an hilt and ensued, and a skeletal head,

[01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:07.550]
and when they took his false, they discovered he was dead.

[01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:12.310]
Brained it, that is, no brings a backwards roof.

[01:24:13.190 --> 01:24:18.730]
Now, Jim represents the Christian Reich, but somehow got support from the Jewish journal kites.

[01:24:18.730 --> 01:24:23.950]
Another all in a mass grave, very, very deep, and his wife wears a necklace of the fillings from their tea.

[01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:28.230]
Jewish gold melted down, of course.

[01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:31.810]
The Tallahassee Millionaires.

[01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:39.330]
Starring Heinrich Kimler as Chip Bush, Ava Braun as Columban,

[01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:44.970]
Ariana Huffington as Brandy, and Dan Burton as General Berkhalder.

[01:24:46.370 --> 01:24:49.990]
The Tallahassee Millionaires, brought to you by Zagon 8.

[01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:52.810]
And don't forget Anne Coder is Catherine Harris.

[01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:57.170]
1046 at 560 W. Kimler, ever seen together? No, rest my case.

[01:24:58.310 --> 01:25:00.870]
567-0560, what's going on with the phone, George? You're just giving up.

[01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:04.770]
Oh, I'm sorry. Just put them on hold, okay? We don't expect you to speak to them, but just put them on hold.

[01:25:04.930 --> 01:25:05.950]
I know we don't want to overwork you.

[01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:10.930]
Pete the Chronix is, voted in the pines today with all the help that they see.

[01:25:10.930 --> 01:25:15.450]
And you know something? The seniors who go page by page to find your name ahead of one hour wait.

[01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:19.090]
It says, how about a few Jeb Bush FM carts?

[01:25:19.730 --> 01:25:22.070]
I want to claim the fame, Pete the Chronix, and you're right.

[01:25:22.530 --> 01:25:24.090]
Have a nice day, Pete, and go away.

[01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:28.730]
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T Line, WQAM.

[01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:32.590]
Lauren Neill, have a birthday, too. Thank you so much.

[01:25:32.850 --> 01:25:33.650]
Okay, have a great day.

[01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:38.330]
I almost didn't vote for Bill McBridey, because this morning about 8 o'clock

[01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:40.970]
I get this recorded phone call from Julie Lieberman.

[01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:43.370]
That's the vote for his friend, Bill McBridey.

[01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:44.170]
That would turn me off.

[01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:45.970]
Turn me off, for a quick, but I'm not blaming.

[01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:47.610]
I'm not blaming. Before I got to the polls.

[01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:50.930]
Anyway, thanks for your hammer. I love the condolese or ice bomb.

[01:25:51.130 --> 01:25:52.090]
All right, that's coming up.

[01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:53.090]
All right, baby.

[01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:54.910]
Thanks. Coming up, I almost forgot about that.

[01:25:55.090 --> 01:25:57.870]
Also the Mohaward on Fox Sports promo is coming up.

[01:25:58.950 --> 01:26:01.430]
And up. And up and up and up. Just like lunch.

[01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:05.970]
567-0560, pound 560. Neils, birthday, it's election day.

[01:26:05.970 --> 01:26:08.890]
And there he goes, starting to have to plug those numbers again, because they're all kind of like,

[01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:11.330]
well, I think we're done with this. I think we're done with this.

[01:26:11.490 --> 01:26:13.270]
And let me just tell you something else. I don't give a crap.

[01:26:14.490 --> 01:26:15.610]
Do you care anymore, really?

[01:26:16.290 --> 01:26:17.150]
Well, yeah, I'm stuck here.

[01:26:17.650 --> 01:26:18.650]
Oh, that's right. Well, I'm not.

[01:26:19.190 --> 01:26:21.030]
I just, I don't care anymore. It's just, it's hopeless.

[01:26:21.130 --> 01:26:21.870]
This country's hopeless.

[01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:23.990]
It's hopeless. It's been taken over.

[01:26:24.190 --> 01:26:26.250]
Like I said yesterday, the Democratic Party blows.

[01:26:26.770 --> 01:26:30.170]
They've just like kind of thrown into the towel, left it all these other people have come along,

[01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:33.590]
and done this bloodless coup, and the Democrats have covered in the corners and said,

[01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:36.650]
oh, you're right. We aren't liberals anymore. We're like, that's a dirty word, right?

[01:26:36.810 --> 01:26:40.050]
Kami Pinko, whatever. It's like a throwback to the McCarthy days again.

[01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:45.710]
Either you're with us or you're against us, and of course, very unpatriotic, too.

[01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:48.610]
And then of course, what is cool, man?

[01:26:48.690 --> 01:26:51.830]
Oh, did you know that Neil Coleman, what's his name, not Neil?

[01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:54.050]
What is his name in Minnesota? Whatever to help Norm.

[01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:59.690]
Norm Coleman. He went to school. He was a classmate of Norman Elliott Kent.

[01:27:00.730 --> 01:27:01.610]
No, I did not know that.

[01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:04.830]
How do you like that? Who said that? He used to be Norman Coleman. He used to be a member of the SDS,

[01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:09.890]
the students for Democratic society, the most raving left wing, ultra liberal skumbags out there,

[01:27:10.210 --> 01:27:14.030]
and he's all over the place. Now he's the right wing, a fetus hugging.

[01:27:14.370 --> 01:27:17.790]
In other words, whatever is expedient, which Germandale talked about in that debate yesterday.

[01:27:18.010 --> 01:27:18.770]
He must have got it every month.

[01:27:19.050 --> 01:27:21.910]
Whatever is expedient. In fact, his politics are like Jerry Wischner's hairpiece.

[01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:27.090]
They changed the tone and flavor and color depending on the ambiance of the surroundings.

[01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:29.770]
He's a political chameleon.

[01:27:29.770 --> 01:27:31.750]
That's right. That's seriously. You're laughing about that.

[01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:35.430]
Wischner's depending on the lighting and the day of the week and whatever.

[01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:38.690]
His piece, some days, would be like kind of pink and puse.

[01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:42.090]
In other days, would be like, have more of a green tinge to it. Maybe he died it.

[01:27:43.170 --> 01:27:44.230]
He did, he died it.

[01:27:45.930 --> 01:27:47.770]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[01:27:49.210 --> 01:27:54.090]
5, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line. How about those dolphins?

[01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:55.930]
Let's hear it. That's why they depressed today.

[01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:59.110]
Too bad. You better get with the reality of it.

[01:27:59.110 --> 01:28:01.470]
Okay, folks. You better get with the reality. It's the same old tease.

[01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:05.130]
Every year, it's the big tease. And then something happens.

[01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:08.490]
Whether it's an injury or just a choke job. Something happens, man.

[01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:10.670]
Pretty ugly last night.

[01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:12.550]
W. to Q.A.M.

[01:28:15.010 --> 01:28:15.930]
Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:28:16.330 --> 01:28:16.730]
Hello.

[01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.390]
Yes, sir.

[01:28:17.730 --> 01:28:18.030]
Neil.

[01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:18.610]
Yes, sir.

[01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:22.690]
This is Jim Stork from Wild Manor's Wishing You a Happy Birthday.

[01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:25.430]
I haven't talked to you in years, hasn't it?

[01:28:25.630 --> 01:28:27.070]
Thanks, Jim. How are you doing?

[01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:27.650]
How are you doing?

[01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:35.690]
I am doing good. I'm just kind of in sticker shock over this whole election thing.

[01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:36.210]

[01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:39.270]
You know, I just became an elected official.

[01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:39.910]
So the whole...

[01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:41.130]
You became an elected official?

[01:28:41.530 --> 01:28:42.830]
Yes, back in March.

[01:28:43.290 --> 01:28:44.490]
You didn't know I was...

[01:28:44.490 --> 01:28:49.290]
Yes, you know, because I talked to Norm the other day in Wild Manor's here as the mayor.

[01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:49.850]
Yeah.

[01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:51.670]
Are you the mayor of Wild Manor's?

[01:28:51.690 --> 01:28:52.130]
Yes, sir.

[01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:53.210]
Oh my God.

[01:28:53.410 --> 01:28:55.590]
I know you corrupted me back about 10 years ago.

[01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:56.370]
I tried.

[01:28:56.730 --> 01:28:57.750]
I tried to work.

[01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:59.050]
It did.

[01:28:59.230 --> 01:29:00.570]
Oh, you're talking about politics, actually.

[01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:01.670]
I thought you were talking about something else.

[01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.410]
Exactly.

[01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:03.130]
Exactly.

[01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:07.670]
But I want to wish you a happy birthday and I miss listening to your show.

[01:29:07.810 --> 01:29:08.850]
I'm just so busy these days.

[01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:10.650]
I can't listen to it enough.

[01:29:11.690 --> 01:29:14.650]
Well, tell all those long cabin Republicans that we're going to round up the race

[01:29:14.650 --> 01:29:16.010]
if they don't get disdain out today.

[01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:17.290]
I will tell them.

[01:29:17.410 --> 01:29:18.230]
I will tell them.

[01:29:18.430 --> 01:29:19.010]
Okay, thanks.

[01:29:19.190 --> 01:29:19.890]
Good hair from you, Jim.

[01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:21.030]
Okay, bye.

[01:29:21.730 --> 01:29:22.610]
Wow. How do you like that?

[01:29:22.650 --> 01:29:23.210]
I can write a book.

[01:29:23.210 --> 01:29:26.530]
I want to know the mayor of Wild Manor's.

[01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:29.190]
Fiblicary?

[01:29:29.710 --> 01:29:30.110]
Yes.

[01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:35.650]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.470]
WQIM.

[01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:40.130]
I like to buy, but you put your hand on it.

[01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:40.990]
WQIM.

[01:29:42.170 --> 01:29:43.190]
Yes, sir.

[01:29:45.010 --> 01:29:45.430]
Spoke it.

[01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:46.170]
Yes, go ahead.

[01:29:46.730 --> 01:29:47.850]
Happy birthday, Uncle Neil.

[01:29:47.970 --> 01:29:48.570]
Thank you, sir.

[01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:51.530]
I'm a who of you who's going to walk for a ride.

[01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:52.170]
Wow.

[01:29:52.570 --> 01:29:54.910]
Even though we probably don't have a time to make a chance.

[01:29:56.190 --> 01:30:00.130]
But I can't, you know, I don't want to like not vote.

[01:30:00.330 --> 01:30:01.370]
Then I have to be close.

[01:30:01.690 --> 01:30:03.950]
Then you always have it like in the back of your mind, you know.

[01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:04.310]
Right.

[01:30:04.630 --> 01:30:04.950]
That's right.

[01:30:05.050 --> 01:30:07.090]
Supposedly, it's supposed to be a ride loses by one vote.

[01:30:07.090 --> 01:30:08.530]
Then we have to come round up your ass.

[01:30:09.230 --> 01:30:10.110]
It's something like that.

[01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.490]
Right.

[01:30:10.690 --> 01:30:11.770]
And I got another thing.

[01:30:11.850 --> 01:30:12.510]
I got another topic.

[01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:16.490]
Everybody's like giving opinions on how to run the Neil Rogers show.

[01:30:16.630 --> 01:30:16.810]
Yeah.

[01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:19.130]
Let me put on my two cents in.

[01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.950]
Go right ahead.

[01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.970]
Take all the time you want.

[01:30:20.970 --> 01:30:23.830]
I'll help you with one of your responses if I may.

[01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:24.670]
Balance for life.

[01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:25.050]
Yeah.

[01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:28.590]
Just based on the zone diet as you know, which is 40, 30, 30, right?

[01:30:29.170 --> 01:30:31.390]
40 carbs, 40 protein, 45.

[01:30:31.930 --> 01:30:35.470]
I say let's apply that formula to the world famous Neil Rogers show.

[01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:35.770]
Yeah.

[01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:42.070]
So it's 40% bedtime story, 30% molded, 30% cloth.

[01:30:42.610 --> 01:30:43.090]
Okay.

[01:30:43.630 --> 01:30:44.210]
What do you think?

[01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:46.030]
Sounds like a weiner to me.

[01:30:46.670 --> 01:30:47.590]
Is George still awake?

[01:30:48.130 --> 01:30:48.570]
Did he fall asleep?

[01:30:48.570 --> 01:30:50.250]
No, George's got his head down on the table.

[01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:51.550]
He's mumbling Hail Mary's now.

[01:30:51.730 --> 01:30:53.270]
What a gig this guy has.

[01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:53.610]
I know.

[01:30:54.710 --> 01:30:55.550]
Hey, don't knock.

[01:30:55.690 --> 01:30:56.270]
Don't knock him though.

[01:30:56.330 --> 01:30:58.250]
He got me a great digital digital camera.

[01:30:58.390 --> 01:31:00.750]
One of those that weighs about two ounces, you know?

[01:31:01.670 --> 01:31:03.190]
It's good to have you back and down.

[01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:04.630]
And you know how the Julio's love you,

[01:31:04.690 --> 01:31:06.410]
even though most of us are not in the closet yet.

[01:31:06.610 --> 01:31:08.330]
Well, we'll drag you out.

[01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:09.450]
Thank you.

[01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:10.830]
You're seeing the world in manners.

[01:31:11.010 --> 01:31:11.250]
Thanks.

[01:31:11.770 --> 01:31:13.190]
How do you like that?

[01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:13.770]
They're coming out.

[01:31:14.770 --> 01:31:16.950]
Well, I tell you, we're getting a lot of good stuff on here.

[01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:18.570]
But not look at this.

[01:31:18.650 --> 01:31:21.890]
Can the GOP convince blacks not to vote from the new republic?

[01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:27.070]
We've never seen in our lifetime an effort to attract the black folk by republicans like we're seeing now.

[01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:30.490]
Former Kansas City mayor manual Cleaver told the Kansas City star last month.

[01:31:30.850 --> 01:31:34.690]
In Missouri, Republican Senate candidate Jim Talent is making the rounds of black business groups.

[01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:35.550]
Yaudi-audi-audi-audi.

[01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:36.210]
How do you like that?

[01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:40.890]
And then it goes on to talk about just exactly what the whole thing is.

[01:31:41.050 --> 01:31:42.770]
And that is, uh, liberals are all bad.

[01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:43.690]
They're not on your side.

[01:31:43.690 --> 01:31:45.790]
They're all about your racist pigs coming vote for us.

[01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:48.210]
Or if it's the very least, if you don't want to do for that, uh, stay home.

[01:31:48.890 --> 01:31:51.570]
Stay home and make babies, but not too many because they'll be liberals too.

[01:31:52.670 --> 01:31:53.610]
How do you like that, huh?

[01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:55.710]
That's what that fox crap was all about.

[01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:59.330]
Although it must be just a coincidence that Moe was on that Fox Sports Station yesterday,

[01:31:59.530 --> 01:32:00.470]
concerning with that enemy.

[01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:01.750]
I'll see Fox and Fox.

[01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:03.330]
Start putting that together in your mind.

[01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:05.290]
I'm just mentioning that in passing.

[01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:07.190]
Nobody, QIM.

[01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:08.690]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:09.350]
How are you doing?

[01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.830]
Great. Thank you.

[01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:11.750]
I just came in from the West Coast.

[01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:14.230]
I've been listening to you show for about an hour and a half.

[01:32:14.370 --> 01:32:15.890]
I'm hearing all the callers with their fans.

[01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:17.770]
Well, come in for the West Coast this morning.

[01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:20.670]
You know, these days I could get with this right wing station.

[01:32:21.150 --> 01:32:24.170]
And I have to admit, uh, this guy, I think Tom something.

[01:32:24.210 --> 01:32:28.250]
I think his last name, but he had, I must have listened to like 60 callers.

[01:32:28.330 --> 01:32:31.650]
And not one caller called and said, hey, I went to the vote this morning.

[01:32:31.730 --> 01:32:34.170]
And, uh, I voted for Jeb.

[01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:36.610]
And I checked my vote and it will change the bill.

[01:32:36.690 --> 01:32:37.090]
And the broad.

[01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:38.590]
What's the call?

[01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:40.590]
I was in and said that.

[01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:40.790]
Yeah.

[01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:42.850]
And Carlton said they had no problems at the point.

[01:32:43.210 --> 01:32:43.370]
Yeah.

[01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:44.470]
Everything was going great.

[01:32:44.770 --> 01:32:47.130]
But no one called and said that their vote would change the building.

[01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.690]
Right.

[01:32:48.190 --> 01:32:49.230]
The fix is in, buddy.

[01:32:49.710 --> 01:32:50.070]
Okay.

[01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.870]
Later.

[01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:52.170]
See, of course, that's on the West Coast.

[01:32:52.170 --> 01:32:54.310]
He's talking about see over those Yahoo stations over there.

[01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:55.090]
I mean, Yahoo counties.

[01:32:55.930 --> 01:32:57.430]
They don't have to worry about fixing them.

[01:32:57.610 --> 01:33:00.070]
But keep in mind, that's why it's always screwed up in date and brown.

[01:33:00.170 --> 01:33:03.810]
If we ever had an honest election in date of brown since I've been here, I don't think so.

[01:33:03.890 --> 01:33:04.310]
I don't believe it.

[01:33:04.770 --> 01:33:05.690]
I do not believe it.

[01:33:06.670 --> 01:33:09.170]
I'm thinking back to all the dead people that were voting in date County.

[01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:11.650]
Xavier Suarez running around in his bathroom two in the morning.

[01:33:11.650 --> 01:33:13.630]
Knock on on people's doors, asking for them to vote for him.

[01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.970]
Yeah.

[01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:16.590]
Kind of like your normal candidate does.

[01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:20.090]
All the dead folks voting.

[01:33:20.150 --> 01:33:21.290]
People going to jail for that.

[01:33:22.610 --> 01:33:23.190]
Metro rail.

[01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:25.090]
Totally totally bogus fixed election.

[01:33:25.650 --> 01:33:27.310]
The Mickey Irons and Arena, which all night.

[01:33:27.390 --> 01:33:28.730]
That was another one all night long.

[01:33:28.730 --> 01:33:29.290]
It was losing.

[01:33:29.410 --> 01:33:30.910]
Then all of a sudden, hey, but I'm banging.

[01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:31.490]
There it is.

[01:33:31.610 --> 01:33:32.450]
No problem at all.

[01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:35.390]
As Mayor Pingapakania said, but I'm being I'm pulling the string.

[01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:39.870]
And of course, you know, our old good close personal friend there.

[01:33:40.170 --> 01:33:40.850]
Juan Madyetta.

[01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:42.270]
Another train monkey.

[01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:43.130]
Yeah, right on his shoulder.

[01:33:43.130 --> 01:33:44.610]
They're like a parrot or trained monkey.

[01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:47.070]
All he needed was the organ grinder.

[01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:51.470]
We haven't had an honest election in this town in a coon stage.

[01:33:51.610 --> 01:33:54.110]
How much is since since the he-coon won the first time.

[01:33:54.330 --> 01:33:55.190]
Remember the old he-coon?

[01:33:55.650 --> 01:33:56.450]
We'll never forget it.

[01:33:56.450 --> 01:33:57.570]
And I think those were fixed too.

[01:33:57.710 --> 01:33:58.770]
But those were fixed for a good guy.

[01:33:58.770 --> 01:33:59.770]
We like the old he-coon.

[01:33:59.850 --> 01:34:00.650]
Remember how he died.

[01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.770]
Yeah.

[01:34:01.770 --> 01:34:04.770]
He was on his exercise bike that George gave him for his birthday.

[01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.950]
Yeah.

[01:34:07.130 --> 01:34:08.050]
And all of a sudden.

[01:34:08.090 --> 01:34:08.690]
Oh, yeah.

[01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:09.750]
That's why I don't use it.

[01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.650]
You're not fooling me.

[01:34:11.190 --> 01:34:13.410]
You're not fooling me all these summertime shows.

[01:34:13.650 --> 01:34:15.030]
Yeah, oh, the old man died.

[01:34:15.190 --> 01:34:15.710]
I'm moving in.

[01:34:16.170 --> 01:34:16.990]
I can work real cheap.

[01:34:17.530 --> 01:34:18.990]
Yeah, from what I'm hearing about your new contract,

[01:34:18.990 --> 01:34:20.350]
you'll continue to work real cheap.

[01:34:20.450 --> 01:34:22.450]
Okay, so don't get too excited about it.

[01:34:23.770 --> 01:34:25.730]
Look at those votes, poor and in man on this poll.

[01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:27.490]
This is a hell, a hell-raising.

[01:34:28.650 --> 01:34:29.370]
371 votes.

[01:34:29.370 --> 01:34:32.730]
What should the punishment be for Mohawar David sucking up to the enemy?

[01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:36.030]
Fox Sports yesterday when that grotesque call he made to Tony Bruno.

[01:34:36.210 --> 01:34:39.770]
If you missed it earlier, we played it because we got the promo from our good friends over there at Fox.

[01:34:40.230 --> 01:34:40.870]
And which we have many.

[01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:42.670]
And let me say it again, they hate him worse than we do.

[01:34:43.170 --> 01:34:44.030]
Is that possible?

[01:34:44.370 --> 01:34:45.370]
They despise that man.

[01:34:45.810 --> 01:34:47.730]
At any rate, he calls it and to the enemy.

[01:34:47.890 --> 01:34:49.750]
Sucking around with how great the show is, Tony Bruno.

[01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:51.790]
What just happens to be on opposite the show?

[01:34:52.170 --> 01:34:54.130]
As some of you know, all 10 of you sports lucky.

[01:34:54.410 --> 01:34:55.830]
By the way, nice game again, Ray Lucas.

[01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:57.970]
So anyway, here's the vote.

[01:34:57.970 --> 01:34:59.170]
Who's Mohawar Davided?

[01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:00.970]
122, 33%.

[01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:02.990]
Fire is old, ass 96.

[01:35:03.570 --> 01:35:04.790]
Steelers 2 pay 65.

[01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:07.070]
He gets raked it by the whole staff.

[01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:08.850]
34.

[01:35:09.810 --> 01:35:12.410]
No penalty gets a gold starter purple jelly bean 20.

[01:35:13.170 --> 01:35:14.710]
Vanishing from Paradise 20.

[01:35:15.010 --> 01:35:17.010]
And he gets raked by freaky carluses up to 14.

[01:35:17.630 --> 01:35:18.370]
371 votes.

[01:35:18.370 --> 01:35:19.890]
It's not even 11 o'clock yet.

[01:35:19.930 --> 01:35:20.430]
How do you like that?

[01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:22.790]
Fly in and look all time.

[01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.970]
Here's Sports Radio 5CC.

[01:35:24.810 --> 01:35:25.230]
You ain't.

[01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:26.150]
You ain't.

[01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.670]
You ain't.

[01:35:27.670 --> 01:35:30.270]
Prittians done as dirt.

[01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:41.250]
Andolita, Andolita, Chevron Marie.

[01:35:42.650 --> 01:35:47.450]
With your fucking yellow teeth so far apart.

[01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:54.230]
Andolita, Andolita, what you be doing.

[01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:58.270]
Get me a match just like that.

[01:35:58.510 --> 01:36:00.730]
Token, schmutz, and thaw.

[01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:05.530]
Is you take, cause you are at home.

[01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:07.250]
Boo, blip, blip, roll.

[01:36:08.490 --> 01:36:11.570]
Is you deflected and tsunami.

[01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:13.450]
Who be smart?

[01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:16.390]
Does they like?

[01:36:17.190 --> 01:36:17.970]
Are you sad?

[01:36:18.270 --> 01:36:20.550]
They're used to delete the.

[01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:27.350]
On the way you watch and talk the what is cause.

[01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:33.210]
Georgia Junior said he trust you can't believe you.

[01:36:33.450 --> 01:36:34.310]
I got the wrong idea.

[01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:39.570]
You still are allies of the greedy oil wall.

[01:36:41.110 --> 01:36:45.810]
But then he make you clean all the white house basil.

[01:36:45.810 --> 01:36:47.590]
Another train monkey.

[01:37:15.810 --> 01:37:16.290]
Andolita, andolita, what you be doing.

[01:37:16.290 --> 01:37:16.290]

[01:37:16.290 --> 01:37:18.590]
They're used to be their tokens too.

[01:37:19.770 --> 01:37:25.230]
One day while you be sick and fat cake, you may realize.

[01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:31.610]
That they train you just like your esterone.

[01:37:32.730 --> 01:37:36.530]
That's when your head will move from side to side.

[01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:44.250]
Andolita, until Bush and Remy, they be cracked as old.

[01:37:44.610 --> 01:37:48.210]
Oh, why do I forgot to tell Reverend Jones something.

[01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:52.710]
But anyway, then knowing he moved to Kansas City, that's why I didn't see him in the track last night.

[01:37:53.290 --> 01:37:58.970]
Two questions that says, first did you ever get any confirmation of the call last week that said Mohawer David was behind the initial schmutz during with Fox News?

[01:37:59.150 --> 01:37:59.830]
No, we did not.

[01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:05.150]
Second, without me into sound like an alter-cocker, I heard you mention that you used Coke to you tend to have some effect on your pulse rate.

[01:38:05.150 --> 01:38:06.390]
Could you explain just a little more things?

[01:38:06.730 --> 01:38:12.150]
It's a great product for your heart. Your body produces Coke you tend, but naturally, but as you get older, it produces less.

[01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:18.510]
And they found that Coke you tend is extremely important to the healthy right along with your gums, by the way.

[01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:19.610]
Oh, that's important.

[01:38:19.730 --> 01:38:21.130]
Do you hear me talk about that some time ago?

[01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:22.450]
Gum health and your heart.

[01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:24.770]
I've got lovely gums, by the way.

[01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:26.730]
Also my eye doctor yesterday said, oh, gum, lovely.

[01:38:27.710 --> 01:38:29.270]
I said, yeah, but how about my eyes?

[01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:33.870]
Anyway, Coke you tend to, if you don't believe me, start popping something you'll discover.

[01:38:34.290 --> 01:38:36.530]
And I'm not talking about like 30 or 60 milligrams a day.

[01:38:36.670 --> 01:38:39.090]
I'm talking about 150 to 300 milligrams a day.

[01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:43.250]
And you'll know, of course, a lot of people don't take their pulse rate of their blood pressure.

[01:38:43.330 --> 01:38:45.870]
They go to the doctor for stuff like that, which is really stupid, you know.

[01:38:46.750 --> 01:38:49.690]
But you'll see the tremendous, and me almost immediately effect has bringing that pulse rate.

[01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:51.710]
Well, how many people have blood pressures?

[01:38:52.130 --> 01:38:53.270]
Think moment, I'm not home.

[01:38:53.410 --> 01:38:54.670]
No, no, you don't have to have the big one.

[01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:56.550]
I have the one that goes on your wrist, though.

[01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:57.490]
No matter how limp it is.

[01:38:58.070 --> 01:39:00.010]
Yeah, the little limp wrist monitor.

[01:39:00.150 --> 01:39:00.870]
What else wrong with that?

[01:39:01.170 --> 01:39:02.990]
And then, of course, you get the prick on the end of your finger.

[01:39:03.710 --> 01:39:04.950]
That's what Jim Stork said.

[01:39:06.290 --> 01:39:07.430]
PS says this is a factor.

[01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:10.230]
Why can't you call out drudges the self-hating fact that he is?

[01:39:10.290 --> 01:39:11.110]
I thought I already did that.

[01:39:11.970 --> 01:39:13.210]
He's such a notorious queen.

[01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:15.270]
There's no way he's even going to dare contest the fact.

[01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:15.950]
I don't think he does.

[01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:18.270]
I've had enough of the Jews for Hitler and La Cavan facts.

[01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:19.490]
Me too. I'm sick of it.

[01:39:20.130 --> 01:39:20.670]
Sick of that.

[01:39:20.770 --> 01:39:25.870]
Just like I fact to my close personal friend, Lynn Samuel's yet that he was also good buddies with that self-hating queen, Matt Drudge.

[01:39:25.870 --> 01:39:28.330]
I fact that note to her and I said, I emailed rather.

[01:39:29.450 --> 01:39:33.850]
I said, I've had it with the right-wing self-hating fags like the Alice Rantels of the world.

[01:39:34.190 --> 01:39:35.690]
And the, what's the guy's name there on?

[01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:37.630]
What is his name? Andrew Sullivan.

[01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:38.510]
Another one.

[01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:39.710]
Self-hating Faggot.

[01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:43.890]
Here's another fact that says, Neil, the fixes in.

[01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:46.290]
I went to my place to vote this morning before getting to the machine.

[01:39:46.290 --> 01:39:48.090]
My local pool had me along with everyone else.

[01:39:48.190 --> 01:39:49.490]
Place our signatures in pencil.

[01:39:51.150 --> 01:39:53.030]
Doesn't the legal signature have to be an ink?

[01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:53.710]
Yes.

[01:39:53.710 --> 01:39:55.310]
First, what do you expect from Dave County?

[01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:56.250]
By the way, happy birthday.

[01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:57.210]
Thank you for many years of entertainment.

[01:39:57.650 --> 01:40:00.490]
Go Penguins. How many goals do you think number 66 was going to first five minutes?

[01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:02.430]
I think I might go to that game tomorrow night.

[01:40:03.070 --> 01:40:06.570]
Might actually go to my first Panther game of the season because there's a team worth while watching play.

[01:40:06.930 --> 01:40:07.750]
And it's not the Panthers.

[01:40:08.610 --> 01:40:10.810]
It's Mario and the suddenly hot penguins.

[01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:15.310]
Here's this long facts about Republicans and blacks and convincing them not to vote.

[01:40:15.570 --> 01:40:17.890]
I don't have time for the whole thing, especially on my birthday.

[01:40:18.010 --> 01:40:19.230]
I'm not going to do all that on my birthday.

[01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:21.410]
Maybe we can read it together.

[01:40:22.230 --> 01:40:23.890]
But the last paragraph is worth reading.

[01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:27.990]
It says, in short, it's not time yet to celebrate the end of Republican racial politics.

[01:40:28.450 --> 01:40:31.670]
Conservative Republicans may be paying more attention to black voters than in the past.

[01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:33.510]
And they may be smiling as they speak.

[01:40:33.810 --> 01:40:40.590]
But when this mask of warm-hearted concern is drawn aside, the GOP strategy is still aimed less at creating diverse black political participation

[01:40:40.590 --> 01:40:44.490]
than trying to persuade black Americans to participate as little as possible.

[01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:45.450]
Let's hope it fails.

[01:40:46.050 --> 01:40:50.610]
Here that last line, to persuade black Americans to participate as little as possible.

[01:40:50.610 --> 01:40:52.330]
Let's the... I'm going to stop Iran's eye.

[01:40:53.190 --> 01:40:58.390]
Convince you folks, the dark folks, the liberals are your enemy, their racist, their bunch of cracker assholes.

[01:40:58.650 --> 01:40:59.670]
Don't be voting for anybody.

[01:41:01.570 --> 01:41:03.190]
Who's that on the bat line now?

[01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.810]
Chef Conehead.

[01:41:05.110 --> 01:41:05.990]
Chef Conehead.

[01:41:06.590 --> 01:41:09.470]
How come you don't have that banner playing up there saying vote McBride?

[01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:12.230]
Because I don't mix business and politics.

[01:41:12.570 --> 01:41:13.950]
Well, let's start doing it right now.

[01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:17.130]
Vote McBride, so says Neil Rogers, spokesman for the pizza lot.

[01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:19.630]
Okay, that's it. It's up. Consider it done.

[01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:20.110]
Okay.

[01:41:20.350 --> 01:41:20.850]
Happy birthday.

[01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:21.370]
Thanks.

[01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:23.170]
You're not getting older. You're getting better.

[01:41:23.230 --> 01:41:24.450]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:41:26.610 --> 01:41:27.850]
So what's going on, dude?

[01:41:28.150 --> 01:41:30.110]
Nice game last night, by the way, by your team.

[01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:31.490]
Yeah, I still feel like crap.

[01:41:31.730 --> 01:41:32.170]
You should.

[01:41:32.330 --> 01:41:32.530]
Yeah.

[01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:35.450]
You should. I'd be embarrassed and humiliated. I'm surprised you didn't call to do this.

[01:41:35.450 --> 01:41:36.610]
I'm very one of the best teams in the league.

[01:41:36.650 --> 01:41:37.210]
I'd be... What?

[01:41:37.390 --> 01:41:39.050]
They're one of the best teams in the league.

[01:41:39.130 --> 01:41:41.270]
It's not just a question of one of the best teams in the league.

[01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:43.070]
It's a question of the caliber of the performance.

[01:41:43.770 --> 01:41:43.990]
Hey, hey.

[01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:45.170]
That was pathetic.

[01:41:45.170 --> 01:41:47.290]
And you can have a bad game at the end of the year.

[01:41:47.370 --> 01:41:48.990]
They're going to be first place in the year.

[01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:52.330]
Oh, my God.

[01:41:52.610 --> 01:41:55.110]
This man must be doing magic mushrooms on his pizza.

[01:41:58.610 --> 01:42:01.610]
Ray Lucas couldn't be pepper high school at the game or first.

[01:42:01.770 --> 01:42:02.690]
Lucas played great.

[01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:04.730]
Ray, are you... What game are you watching?

[01:42:05.050 --> 01:42:06.610]
What game are you watching, mister?

[01:42:06.610 --> 01:42:06.770]
What?

[01:42:07.290 --> 01:42:07.690]
Interception.

[01:42:07.930 --> 01:42:09.090]
Oh, my God.

[01:42:09.710 --> 01:42:12.410]
How about when he went back to passing the ball all the way up there?

[01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:19.550]

[01:46:01.530 --> 01:46:03.450]
Hey, speakin' of that, how about start poppin'

[01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:04.450]
some Olima in your post?

[01:46:04.570 --> 01:46:06.210]
Somebody just asked me about Coke, you 10th?

[01:46:06.250 --> 01:46:06.670]
Guess what?

[01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:08.430]
I've been telling you about Olima in the until I'm blue

[01:46:08.430 --> 01:46:09.550]
in the face from talkin' about it.

[01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:12.010]
Olima is a stupendous bunch of formulas

[01:46:12.010 --> 01:46:13.870]
that are scientifically designed to help different parts

[01:46:13.870 --> 01:46:15.230]
of your body and your health.

[01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:16.930]
And now they got three new formulas,

[01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:19.450]
one to help your sleep, one to help you control your weight

[01:46:19.450 --> 01:46:20.750]
and Coke, you 10th.

[01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:21.890]
I'm not makin' that up either.

[01:46:22.410 --> 01:46:23.890]
I'm a big believer in supplements,

[01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:25.970]
but especially Coke, you 10th, I think there's anything else

[01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:27.870]
you can take other than maybe Niasin,

[01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:28.570]
which will make your flush.

[01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:30.570]
But other than that, there's nothing else you can take

[01:46:30.570 --> 01:46:32.790]
that you see such a dramatic and quick result in

[01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:34.550]
than Coke, you 10th, you need it, believe me.

[01:46:35.010 --> 01:46:36.330]
All of these products using the benefits

[01:46:36.330 --> 01:46:38.290]
of the finest purest olive oil you'll find anywhere.

[01:46:38.290 --> 01:46:40.030]
So Olima is an exciting new product

[01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:41.610]
that will help your health and if you wanna pick some up,

[01:46:41.630 --> 01:46:43.570]
you can do it at public's records and Walgreens,

[01:46:43.650 --> 01:46:45.030]
but make sure you're picking shoes which one.

You know those dolphins that go in the AFC?

[01:47:12.530 --> 01:47:14.730]

This is Sports Radio 560.

[01:47:24.370 --> 01:47:25.590]
Way to A.

[01:47:28.030 --> 01:47:31.090]
Holy Makin'on, this is Jobol on the Voice of the Toronto

[01:47:31.090 --> 01:47:32.390]
May Beliefs and you're listening

[01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:34.710]
to the Hockey Authority Neal God.

[01:47:34.710 --> 01:47:37.130]
Oh where are we?

[01:47:37.630 --> 01:47:39.350]
Where am I little dubby?

[01:47:40.610 --> 01:47:43.830]
My little dubby, my little dubby.

[01:47:44.330 --> 01:47:46.190]
Hey, B.C.D.

[01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:47.850]
E.F.G.

[01:47:49.230 --> 01:47:52.090]
It's like a K.L.M.N.

[01:47:52.570 --> 01:47:53.750]
O.B.

[01:47:56.970 --> 01:48:00.990]
Oh, triple, triple, little star.

[01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:05.030]
I do wonder where you go

[01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:09.010]
or check and see when the puppy

[01:48:09.590 --> 01:48:15.130]
to fit your pillow or turn.

[01:48:21.570 --> 01:48:22.470]
Oooooooohhhhhh

[01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:26.370]
I don't get it.

[01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:28.770]
1116 at 560 WQAM.

[01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:29.310]
Do you get it?

[01:48:29.610 --> 01:48:29.870]
No.

[01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:30.210]
Oh.

[01:48:30.730 --> 01:48:31.310]
You'll God.

[01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.850]
Happy birthday.

[01:48:31.890 --> 01:48:33.070]
Many happy returns to the days.

[01:48:33.210 --> 01:48:34.070]
Are there any coincidence that

[01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:35.110]
Moe is pimping Fox?

[01:48:35.250 --> 01:48:36.030]
That you made your harassment

[01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:36.730]
came from Fox?

[01:48:37.090 --> 01:48:37.510]
I don't know.

[01:48:37.650 --> 01:48:38.110]
How do you like that?

[01:48:38.210 --> 01:48:38.890]
That's certainly going to be

[01:48:38.890 --> 01:48:39.990]
a conspiracy theory.

[01:48:40.130 --> 01:48:41.530]
That's some of the conspiracy theory

[01:48:41.530 --> 01:48:43.030]
that some of the conspiracy theory

[01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:44.310]
is going to be passing around.

[01:48:44.590 --> 01:48:45.670]
By the way, how come Fox is going

[01:48:45.670 --> 01:48:46.730]
after HBO and a program

[01:48:46.730 --> 01:48:48.130]
Kirby Enthusiasm, Larry David?

[01:48:48.370 --> 01:48:49.310]
They had a hilarious episode

[01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:50.530]
where Larry David's got a discussion

[01:48:50.530 --> 01:48:51.770]
with a black rapper who calls him

[01:48:51.770 --> 01:48:53.070]
my nigga over and over again.

[01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:54.590]
Then Larry David responds to the rapper

[01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:55.950]
so now you my Caucasian, right?

[01:48:56.370 --> 01:48:57.970]
I guess that's no problem, right?

[01:48:58.490 --> 01:48:58.830]
Right.

[01:48:58.830 --> 01:49:00.010]
Keep rubbing it and the Rosary

[01:49:00.010 --> 01:49:01.430]
needs to if even McBride says rich.

[01:49:01.610 --> 01:49:02.770]
We got about a half a dozen people

[01:49:02.770 --> 01:49:03.810]
voted for McBride already.

[01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:05.010]
That's not bad.

[01:49:06.230 --> 01:49:06.590]
There.

[01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:08.010]
Here's another one.

[01:49:08.110 --> 01:49:08.570]
Happy birthday.

[01:49:08.810 --> 01:49:09.610]
This morning on What's a Vote

[01:49:09.610 --> 01:49:10.710]
in Dave County and I wore a

[01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:11.170]
Jem T-shirt.

[01:49:11.170 --> 01:49:12.290]
They didn't even check my ID.

[01:49:12.690 --> 01:49:13.430]
The good news of what a

[01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:14.870]
former bride sticking to them.

[01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:15.530]
How do you like that?

[01:49:15.610 --> 01:49:15.910]
That's it.

[01:49:16.170 --> 01:49:16.650]
Little substitute.

[01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:18.450]
By the way, here's a bulletin

[01:49:18.450 --> 01:49:18.910]
just in.

[01:49:19.210 --> 01:49:20.430]
All future elections in Florida.

[01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:21.310]
You're only going to be allowed

[01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:22.430]
to vote for people named Bush.

[01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.710]
Yeah.

[01:49:25.150 --> 01:49:26.530]
They just passed that while we were

[01:49:26.530 --> 01:49:27.150]
looking the other way.

[01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:28.090]
We were worried about the

[01:49:28.090 --> 01:49:28.610]
pig amendment.

[01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:32.030]
Only going to be allowed and

[01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:33.190]
they'll keep it simple that way.

[01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:34.050]
Then we don't have to get so

[01:49:34.050 --> 01:49:34.650]
confused.

[01:49:35.050 --> 01:49:35.370]
If it says,

[01:49:35.530 --> 01:49:36.410]
Bush, just push it.

[01:49:36.930 --> 01:49:37.350]
Push it.

[01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:38.310]
Push, Bush.

[01:49:39.810 --> 01:49:40.530]
Here's one that says,

[01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:41.650]
I went to vote in South Miami

[01:49:41.650 --> 01:49:43.850]
at 9 a.m. was out by 9.15 a.m.

[01:49:43.930 --> 01:49:44.350]
No problem.

[01:49:44.510 --> 01:49:45.470]
Don't know if my electronic votes

[01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:46.010]
were counted or

[01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:46.950]
electronically raised to all

[01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:47.870]
shanigans ago when I was

[01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:48.270]

[01:49:48.630 --> 01:49:49.630]
Voted yes on amendment 6.

[01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:50.290]
Second hand spoke.

[01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:50.790]
I'm sorry.

[01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:52.430]
I don't agree with that.

[01:49:53.590 --> 01:49:54.730]
I agree with an principle

[01:49:54.730 --> 01:49:56.210]
not, but not good for

[01:49:56.210 --> 01:49:56.530]
business.

[01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:58.090]
It's actually in a tourist

[01:49:58.090 --> 01:49:59.310]
oriented state not good for

[01:49:59.310 --> 01:50:00.230]
business and for little

[01:50:00.230 --> 01:50:00.950]
business people.

[01:50:01.050 --> 01:50:01.370]
Not good.

[01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.690]
Voted no on the

[01:50:02.690 --> 01:50:03.550]
pig amendment chaired by

previously hanging with the

[01:50:19.650 --> 01:50:20.070]

[01:50:20.290 --> 01:50:20.530]
Okay.

[01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:38.190]
You think you're

[01:50:38.190 --> 01:50:38.870]
concerning with those

[01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:39.510]

[01:50:40.810 --> 01:50:41.910]
And you're right by the way,

[01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.190]

dumb

[01:53:39.570 --> 01:53:43.550]

[01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:10.490]
let me give you a clue

[01:58:13.230 --> 01:58:14.610]
uh... let me guess you okay

[01:58:15.050 --> 01:58:16.170]
how many guess you need

[01:58:16.890 --> 01:58:18.170]
and you didn't let him in

[01:58:18.170 --> 01:58:18.770]
no

[01:58:19.730 --> 01:58:21.510]
what the hell do i want him in here for

[01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:25.770]
what for what to do another hour on the show oh my god you think what he's

[01:58:25.770 --> 01:58:28.590]
boring you think that uh... richard freedom with that called yesterday is a

[01:58:28.590 --> 01:58:29.230]
show stopper

[01:58:29.230 --> 01:58:33.310]
johnny dark i like johnny see that's another thing i don't let that interfere

[01:58:33.310 --> 01:58:36.950]
but he's our co-incident the life we have chosen okay i don't let it

[01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:37.410]
interfere

[01:58:38.710 --> 01:58:41.710]
i'm not gonna feed him first of all because i'm not doing that very much because

[01:58:41.710 --> 01:58:45.170]
we got the food from other black sack that's number one and number two he

[01:58:45.170 --> 01:58:47.790]
come in here and sit down expect to be on the air i don't want him in here

[01:58:47.790 --> 01:58:51.110]

[01:58:51.110 --> 01:58:55.810]
he's uh... and we can maybe okay and reekay but it might be our co-witch it's hard

[01:58:55.810 --> 01:59:00.090]
to talk with your mouthful what johnny dark isn't he one of our pizons now although

[01:59:00.090 --> 01:59:04.090]
based on what every day tells me it certainly wouldn't keep my well anyway oh and

[01:59:04.090 --> 01:59:06.550]
guess what's this got a small penis clearance

[01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:12.550]
what he told you that yes he's a tall guy with long fingers he's Jewish i see that

[01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:14.370]
was his excuse he said he's hung like a butterfly

[01:59:15.450 --> 01:59:18.630]
maybe that's why he can't get laid huh maybe test just biting those girls on the

[01:59:18.630 --> 01:59:21.650]
arm and doing all those grotesque ugly things in the fact that he smells bad

[01:59:21.650 --> 01:59:24.390]
but you know the fact that he's got a very tiny penis

[01:59:24.990 --> 01:59:28.650]
which i thought it was a pretty upstanding for a sportsman or guy like him who's

[01:59:28.650 --> 01:59:31.410]
got to be part of that crowd you know to be saying that because you know you

[01:59:31.410 --> 01:59:34.830]
got a real tiny penis in locker with all the sportsman they laughed their ass off

[02:02:42.190 --> 02:02:42.930]

[02:02:46.090 --> 02:02:48.010]
President of the s**t

[02:02:48.010 --> 02:02:49.550]
President of the s**t

[02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:50.410]
Man news

[02:02:51.150 --> 02:02:52.390]
Man news

[02:02:52.390 --> 02:02:52.730]

[02:02:52.890 --> 02:02:54.330]
Tell you, always say it comes in what?

[02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.950]
80s?

[02:02:55.290 --> 02:02:56.210]
Three, I'm sorry

[02:02:56.210 --> 02:02:57.970]
Come in in the 20s

[02:02:57.970 --> 02:02:58.910]
Guess who died

[02:03:00.210 --> 02:03:01.590]
Well, I need a hint

[02:03:01.590 --> 02:03:02.830]
Lost in space

[02:03:02.830 --> 02:03:04.590]
Oh no, not June Lockhart

[02:03:04.590 --> 02:03:04.930]
No

[02:03:04.930 --> 02:03:06.790]
I would have said lassie

[02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:07.850]
For June Lockhart

[02:03:07.850 --> 02:03:08.470]
That the professor

[02:03:09.370 --> 02:03:10.390]
Jonathan Harris

[02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:11.050]
Oh no

[02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:16.330]
Jonathan Harris, the flamboyantly fussy actor portrayed the dastardly cowardly antagonist

[02:03:16.330 --> 02:03:20.250]
Dr. Zachary Smith on the 60 sci-fi show Lost in Space has died

[02:03:20.250 --> 02:03:20.710]
He died?

[02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:21.730]
He was 87

[02:03:21.730 --> 02:03:23.430]
Well, that's old enough

[02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:29.350]
Harris died Sunday from a blood clot in his heart while receiving therapy at an incinerary hospital from a chronic back problem

[02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:30.270]
How do you like that?

[02:03:30.490 --> 02:03:32.270]
Family spokesman Kevin Burns said yesterday

[02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:34.010]
Born Jonathan

[02:03:34.930 --> 02:03:35.450]
Cheras...

[02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:36.130]
Oh boy

[02:03:36.130 --> 02:03:37.290]
Cheras Succhin

[02:03:37.290 --> 02:03:39.530]
In the Bronx to Russian Jewish immigrant parents

[02:03:39.530 --> 02:03:41.750]
Oh see, you don't like him as much anymore, he was Jewish

[02:03:42.610 --> 02:03:44.390]
Harris adopted the stage person

[02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:45.490]
There's Duffie and Jewish

[02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:51.870]
Harris adopted the stage person of a classically trained British actor with his grand eloquent accent crisp anunciation

[02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:53.530]
And for a professorial manner

[02:03:54.010 --> 02:03:54.850]
What did my phone?

[02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:57.690]
The hotline number

[02:03:58.370 --> 02:03:59.030]
For what?

[02:03:59.270 --> 02:04:00.110]
A celebrity caller

[02:04:00.110 --> 02:04:01.270]
Oh, somebody did like

[02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:02.470]
Are we going to start with that again?

[02:04:02.690 --> 02:04:03.890]
You know how I feel about that

[02:04:03.890 --> 02:04:04.570]
Somebody would like

[02:04:04.570 --> 02:04:06.010]
Birthdays and anniversaries man

[02:04:06.010 --> 02:04:08.370]
You all like refugees to set up those contrabcoes

[02:04:08.370 --> 02:04:12.930]
Oh boy, talk about the insincere kind of like Al Gore

[02:04:12.930 --> 02:04:13.510]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:04:13.810 --> 02:04:14.210]
Disingenuous?

[02:04:15.710 --> 02:04:17.470]
I don't see the hotline ringing by the way

[02:04:18.170 --> 02:04:20.610]
When people would ask him if he was from England Harris would confess

[02:04:20.610 --> 02:04:22.450]
Oh no my dear, just affected

[02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:26.950]
Said Burns a long time friend and director of the 1998 documentary Lost in Space Forever

[02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:29.750]
He also worked with Pixar Animation Studios in recent years

[02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:32.930]
Supplying the voice of many, the praying mantis magician in a bug's life

[02:04:32.930 --> 02:04:35.330]
And the elderly dog repairman in Toys to Re2

[02:04:36.110 --> 02:04:37.790]
Oh there's the bad line, hello

[02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:38.570]
Hello

[02:04:38.570 --> 02:04:39.350]
Yes

[02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:40.190]
Neil?

[02:04:40.490 --> 02:04:40.790]
Yes

[02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:41.690]
Happy birthday

[02:04:41.690 --> 02:04:42.690]
Thanks, who's this?

[02:04:43.090 --> 02:04:43.270]
Thank

[02:04:45.250 --> 02:04:47.410]
You sound like you're at a tunnel somewhere

[02:04:47.410 --> 02:04:51.410]
I'm here with movers, otherwise I'd be there to wish you happy birthday

[02:04:51.410 --> 02:04:52.570]
Are you moving into your new place?

[02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:54.670]
I've got you know, movers coming in today

[02:04:54.670 --> 02:04:55.010]
Great

[02:04:55.010 --> 02:04:57.910]
Well listen after this election now you might want to change the destination

[02:04:57.910 --> 02:05:00.530]
I was thinking of maybe the West Coast

[02:05:00.530 --> 02:05:01.110]
Yeah

[02:05:02.410 --> 02:05:04.470]
Happy, welcome to the over the hill gang

[02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:06.930]
Oh that's right, you're a little bit ahead of me just a little bit

[02:05:06.930 --> 02:05:09.950]
I think there's somebody who's ahead of both of us by the way

[02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:12.130]
Oh, we all hit that

[02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:18.690]
In fact that would be, I think we already did that poll, who's the oldest of them all?

[02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:19.350]
No contest

[02:05:19.770 --> 02:05:20.130]
Yeah

[02:05:20.130 --> 02:05:20.930]
No contest

[02:05:20.930 --> 02:05:24.230]
So how about now, you did the thing a couple of years ago with your buddy Romi

[02:05:24.230 --> 02:05:26.590]
Which you know, we looked the other way, we, you know, just like

[02:05:26.590 --> 02:05:30.130]
Yeah, but I got to tell you something, that was not contrived

[02:05:30.670 --> 02:05:30.830]
No

[02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:31.690]
You know, plan

[02:05:31.690 --> 02:05:32.730]
And then you didn't

[02:05:32.730 --> 02:05:34.990]
You didn't work with a SBN and he asked me to do it

[02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.290]
Right

[02:05:35.290 --> 02:05:37.890]
And frankly it was thoughtless, I'm like barred because

[02:05:37.890 --> 02:05:39.030]
Yes it was, don't do it again

[02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:40.130]
I wouldn't

[02:05:40.130 --> 02:05:43.630]
But, but to make a long story short now, have you been listening to this thing we've been playing today?

[02:05:44.110 --> 02:05:44.350]
Yeah

[02:05:45.730 --> 02:05:46.090]
Yeah

[02:05:48.930 --> 02:05:49.290]
And

[02:05:50.210 --> 02:05:52.070]
Even they took a shot

[02:05:52.070 --> 02:05:54.330]
Yeah, no Howard David, they're calling it

[02:05:54.330 --> 02:05:57.450]
In fact you know something as much as he despises being called, maybe we can get him

[02:05:57.450 --> 02:06:00.090]
And he could be a celebrity on all the stations in the market and start talking about

[02:06:00.090 --> 02:06:02.050]
No Howard David, I think to put him right on the map

[02:06:03.070 --> 02:06:06.350]
I don't know what his problem is, I'm giving him like billions of dollars of free publicity

[02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:07.810]
And he's a belly-hicken about it

[02:06:07.810 --> 02:06:09.630]
I don't get it, I always accept it

[02:06:09.630 --> 02:06:13.650]
So how do you like to, and you know something like I said, you're good friend because I know you're in here close to Joe

[02:06:13.650 --> 02:06:16.130]
We had a nice chat out here yesterday, see that's the difference

[02:06:16.130 --> 02:06:18.370]
Joe knows it's business, not personal

[02:06:18.930 --> 02:06:21.910]
And he understands what it's all about

[02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:24.330]
He wished you a happy birthday on here yesterday

[02:06:24.330 --> 02:06:25.190]
How do you like that?

[02:06:25.650 --> 02:06:26.690]
So, I always like Joe

[02:06:26.690 --> 02:06:27.390]
Yep

[02:06:27.390 --> 02:06:30.330]
Not on the ear so much, no it's been seriously, it's the difference

[02:06:30.330 --> 02:06:32.190]
But anyway, how about that game last night, huh?

[02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:33.930]
Well, I called it

[02:06:33.930 --> 02:06:34.290]
Did you?

[02:06:34.610 --> 02:06:35.010]
Yeah

[02:06:35.890 --> 02:06:40.270]
She when it comes to my wallet, you don't have those, you know

[02:06:40.270 --> 02:06:40.650]
Right

[02:06:40.650 --> 02:06:42.750]
I don't have a broke your feelings

[02:06:42.750 --> 02:06:44.090]
Right, exactly

[02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:49.150]
Well, and I wonder what kind of game, maybe I'm wrong, I don't know, I didn't see all of it

[02:06:49.150 --> 02:06:52.370]
I saw some of the track and then it had a sort of last quarter and a half at home

[02:06:52.370 --> 02:06:56.090]
But people are telling me Lucas played a great game, I mean he threw some good passes

[02:06:56.090 --> 02:07:00.210]
But having a great game is that it does not mean throwing a few good passes

[02:07:00.210 --> 02:07:01.490]
And then like playing like a high score

[02:07:01.490 --> 02:07:03.010]
I played a game compared to the last one

[02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:05.330]
Yeah, which is in San Munch

[02:07:06.130 --> 02:07:09.190]
No, he's, you know, he got jittery towards the end

[02:07:09.190 --> 02:07:15.450]
And he made a couple of real bad throws again, you know, they had four, you know, they turned them all over too many times

[02:07:15.450 --> 02:07:16.590]
Wasn't all his fault

[02:07:16.590 --> 02:07:18.930]
No, but put it this way, he wasn't the only culprit

[02:07:18.930 --> 02:07:20.390]
No, but he sure did his part

[02:07:21.010 --> 02:07:21.090]
Yep

[02:07:21.090 --> 02:07:23.910]
And Chris Carden exactly lighted up either last night

[02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:27.450]
No, but, you could apply that to Rust

[02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:32.070]
I think Paul Warfield's coming back next week in Danny, Danny and Paul, what's wrong with that?

[02:07:32.850 --> 02:07:34.390]
Yeah, that wouldn't be so bad

[02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:36.710]
They might track the hell out of you, I'll tell you that right now

[02:07:37.470 --> 02:07:37.830]
Well

[02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:41.170]
And why is it that Dolphans, I don't know, maybe it's everywhere

[02:07:41.170 --> 02:07:43.570]
But they look at now for example when the Patriots were down here

[02:07:43.570 --> 02:07:46.490]
I mean, they said they missed a bust, they didn't show up, they played a terrible game

[02:07:46.490 --> 02:07:52.230]
Why is it that Dolphans can't do that and say hey, we stuck, as opposed to all the excuses and but a beat

[02:07:52.230 --> 02:07:53.450]
But I don't get that

[02:07:53.450 --> 02:07:54.370]
Maybe they don't have that on the...

[02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:55.810]
You know something, the green base is good

[02:07:55.810 --> 02:07:56.850]
They are good

[02:07:56.850 --> 02:08:00.030]
And nobody beats that team up there, particularly when it's cold

[02:08:00.030 --> 02:08:02.550]
So why is everybody so shocked?

[02:08:02.690 --> 02:08:06.670]
I wasn't shocked, I called it two weeks ago, I was told it was going no chance

[02:08:06.670 --> 02:08:08.950]
They could have a problem again this week

[02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:12.650]
And to be honest with you, the green base really, I don't know, they kind of coasted a little bit

[02:08:12.650 --> 02:08:14.990]
They could have had about 45 points in that game last night

[02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:16.370]
Yeah, they're very good

[02:08:16.370 --> 02:08:17.390]
They really are

[02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:22.290]
Anyway, I was thinking about you, I'm sitting here with you watching these guys move my stuff in

[02:08:23.410 --> 02:08:26.010]
And I'm delighted for you that you're moving in

[02:08:26.010 --> 02:08:26.510]
Oh, you're moving in?

[02:08:27.170 --> 02:08:27.470]
Yeah

[02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:28.090]
Excellent

[02:08:28.590 --> 02:08:32.890]
So, yeah, hopefully, if you don't be finished in a couple weeks

[02:08:32.890 --> 02:08:34.290]
But you're still in Dave County though

[02:08:35.250 --> 02:08:36.490]
Yeah, I'm on the edge

[02:08:36.490 --> 02:08:40.030]
Proving that nothing is perfect, just close enough to make a quick escape, like here at work

[02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:43.090]
I'm right by the ocean, I can get out of here and it is

[02:08:43.090 --> 02:08:44.310]
Even in a boat

[02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:46.410]
But I can fight the incoming traffic

[02:08:46.410 --> 02:08:49.250]
Maybe you can borrow one of those rafts from the Haitians, they're not going to use it again

[02:08:49.250 --> 02:08:50.550]
I'm not going to say, that's a fight the incoming

[02:08:50.550 --> 02:08:55.010]
Now, I want to give you, because I know you're already aware what you're going to be dealing with this afternoon for a couple of hours

[02:08:55.010 --> 02:08:59.790]
And that is the beat, don't you think that there's a conspiracy against the Hercunes?

[02:09:00.430 --> 02:09:01.650]
I love that one

[02:09:02.450 --> 02:09:08.030]
Now that they've dropped to number three, Hank wants to talk all afternoon about what are we going to do about the BCS conspiracy?

[02:09:08.590 --> 02:09:10.950]
Yeah, he can save that for Eddie Kaplan, he loves that

[02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:14.350]
Okay, thanks, see you later, thank you

[02:09:14.930 --> 02:09:18.230]
Okay, it was Hank with a bad connection there, it sounded like he was rising in his new place, huh?

[02:09:18.450 --> 02:09:19.690]
It sounded like he was lost in space

[02:09:19.690 --> 02:09:20.630]
In the basement

[02:09:20.630 --> 02:09:23.290]
Yeah, it sounded like he was out in no man's land

[02:09:23.290 --> 02:09:24.550]
Anyway, so Richard, what's his name?

[02:09:24.850 --> 02:09:26.930]
Richard Harris died the other day, so that was a 40-in-slip

[02:09:26.930 --> 02:09:30.690]
Richard Harris died, and then who was the one we had yesterday?

[02:09:32.690 --> 02:09:34.610]
Which I just got through talking about a little while ago

[02:09:34.610 --> 02:09:34.910]
I know

[02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:35.950]
I know, I know, I know who was

[02:09:35.950 --> 02:09:39.050]
And now we got Jonathan Harris from lost in space

[02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:40.450]
He was great, always comes in three

[02:09:40.450 --> 02:09:42.150]
He was funny, him and the robot

[02:09:42.150 --> 02:09:43.510]
He was no writing McDowell

[02:09:44.010 --> 02:09:44.890]
He was no built mummy

[02:09:44.890 --> 02:09:45.830]
You know writing McDowell?

[02:09:45.950 --> 02:09:46.570]
Yeah, he's dead

[02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:48.810]
And habits to the best of us

[02:09:48.810 --> 02:09:52.990]
There's 20 till noon at 5, 60, WQM, we got the mad dog at one Hank will be on a three

[02:09:52.990 --> 02:09:54.530]
And we're talking about that BCS pool

[02:09:54.530 --> 02:09:56.450]
5 to 6, you got Patrick Sir Tan

[02:09:56.450 --> 02:09:58.910]
That's Mr. Sir Tan to you, he's got a good tan

[02:09:59.530 --> 02:10:01.090]
And then you got what do you got?

[02:10:01.150 --> 02:10:02.670]
6, 30 to 8, 30, who are at Coon Hotline

[02:10:03.790 --> 02:10:04.990]
And what are we gonna do again?

[02:10:05.130 --> 02:10:07.030]
What are we gonna do about that BCS pool now that-

[02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:08.390]
Harukai, f***ing blow

[02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:09.910]
And at 8, 30 you got the big one

[02:10:09.910 --> 02:10:12.570]
Because we have absolutely nobody else to put on here in those hours

[02:10:12.570 --> 02:10:15.930]
Eddie K from GA will be talking about the Overs and Unders and the Inns and Outs

[02:10:15.930 --> 02:10:17.250]
And Joe and Mark overnight

[02:10:17.250 --> 02:10:20.310]
So Joe and Mark played the Howard call to Fox last night?

[02:10:20.490 --> 02:10:23.170]
Well he said that he was gunner when I talked to him

[02:10:23.170 --> 02:10:24.770]
Well let's find out if he had the balls

[02:10:24.770 --> 02:10:26.710]
And we'll talk to him, okay, because he's the one person in the building

[02:10:26.710 --> 02:10:29.770]
Who's been 8-well of and guilty, who does it for survival sake

[02:10:29.770 --> 02:10:33.050]
But other than that, he's the one person in the building who's really been sucking on an old bag

[02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:33.710]
You know what I mean?

[02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:35.650]
Only from like 430 on

[02:10:35.650 --> 02:10:40.530]
In fact the rumor has it around a building that the day that most bags slipped off the edge of the chair there

[02:10:40.530 --> 02:10:42.530]
That Joe was the one that like mopped it up

[02:10:43.610 --> 02:10:44.270]
Like that

[02:10:46.490 --> 02:10:47.390]
Just like that

[02:10:48.250 --> 02:10:49.350]
Oh my God

[02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:51.050]
Well that's a good thing we don't have TV today

[02:10:51.050 --> 02:10:53.770]
Right before lunchtime, Sam found out you guys lose weight

[02:10:54.110 --> 02:10:57.950]
Let's face you, you've been here about fast-trained for a long time for a coons age on a show

[02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:59.570]
That's right, a coons age

[02:10:59.570 --> 02:11:02.230]
And the fact, and what is a coons age when it come right down to it?

[02:11:02.290 --> 02:11:02.430]

The radio is on your side

[02:12:12.910 --> 02:12:13.630]

[02:12:13.630 --> 02:12:17.450]
Never know who will call Tony Bruno on 940 Flax Sports Radio

[02:12:17.450 --> 02:12:19.890]

You're a fine looking fascist and a perfect little Nazi

[02:13:04.750 --> 02:13:07.870]
I want to build their coffee through your soil panties

[02:13:08.550 --> 02:13:11.130]
Discoating news, looking slug and sweet

[02:13:11.130 --> 02:13:14.890]
Laughing your limbs like ancoltors roast beef

[02:13:14.890 --> 02:13:16.530]

We really like to f**k you

You ever think about doing that, Alisa?

[02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:33.810]
Do you think you're f**king stupid?

[02:13:33.810 --> 02:13:35.810]
You want to touch it?

[02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:37.090]
Three ways, sir

[02:13:37.810 --> 02:13:39.030]
You're not going to miss

[02:13:39.670 --> 02:13:41.010]
Don't you think I'm f**king stupid?

[02:13:41.730 --> 02:13:41.870]
No

[02:13:41.870 --> 02:13:45.290]
The little pigs roast but they treat your punks

[02:13:45.890 --> 02:13:48.850]
I'll bet it tastes like bubble gum

[02:13:48.850 --> 02:13:52.290]
See you next time you need a story done

[02:13:52.290 --> 02:13:56.070]
Since it takes something for roads to make you come

[02:13:56.070 --> 02:13:57.710]
Flax News Hello

[02:14:01.290 --> 02:14:02.030]

Flax News Hello

[02:14:05.290 --> 02:14:07.410]
We really like to f**k you

[02:14:08.290 --> 02:14:10.290]
Okay it's 12th till midnight at 5.60

[02:14:10.290 --> 02:14:11.550]
Come in to QAM

[02:14:13.530 --> 02:14:15.270]
Doval voting troubles continue

[02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:16.650]
Though they opened on time

[02:14:16.650 --> 02:14:17.810]
Troubles of the new voting machines

[02:14:17.810 --> 02:14:19.490]
have a number of precincts in Duval County

[02:14:19.490 --> 02:14:21.170]
They provided many ballots from being counted

[02:14:21.170 --> 02:14:23.170]
Though now we're told the problem has been resolved

[02:14:23.930 --> 02:14:25.590]
This is somebody just facts to me

[02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:28.170]
From Jacksonville's WOKV.com

[02:14:29.130 --> 02:14:32.830]
Among those precincts affected was the Murray Singleton Senior Center

[02:14:33.490 --> 02:14:33.670]
Oi

[02:14:33.670 --> 02:14:36.330]
The precinct that had the most trouble on primary day

[02:14:36.330 --> 02:14:39.310]
Korean Brown, Congressional candidate was outraged at the problems of the polls

[02:14:39.310 --> 02:14:40.710]
And told WOKV News

[02:14:40.710 --> 02:14:42.530]
She was aware of similar problems of precinct 100

[02:14:43.030 --> 02:14:45.490]
Both of these polls are heavily African-American precincts

[02:14:46.030 --> 02:14:46.550]
Uh oh

[02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:50.170]
And she wondered why those precincts seem to have the most problems

[02:14:50.170 --> 02:14:55.050]
How do you like that? Because we can't imagine who they'd be voting for

[02:14:55.710 --> 02:14:59.610]
Reports from around the city suggest the problem is more widespread than just those precincts

[02:14:59.610 --> 02:15:01.890]
We received similar reports of these four other polling sites

[02:15:01.890 --> 02:15:03.790]
It says that we understand all machines are now online

[02:15:03.790 --> 02:15:06.810]
And processing ballots, whether they're doing it right or not, we don't know

[02:15:07.870 --> 02:15:09.990]
Supervisor elections office tells WOKV News

[02:15:09.990 --> 02:15:11.770]
That in those cases where a ballot won't process

[02:15:11.770 --> 02:15:15.710]
They'll set these ballots aside and try again after the polls close at 7 p.m.

[02:15:15.710 --> 02:15:19.770]
The turnout so far is about as expected with short lines of many precincts

[02:15:19.770 --> 02:15:21.270]
In other words, meaty poker

[02:15:21.870 --> 02:15:25.710]
But the dark folks for some strange reason, it must be just a coincidence, OK?

[02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:31.690]
It must be just a coincidence, but keep in mind like the Fox News and our good friend Heather

[02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:34.670]
Keep telling you, it's us liberals who are again you dark folks, OK?

[02:15:34.990 --> 02:15:36.330]
We're the bad folks, they're the good folks

[02:15:36.330 --> 02:15:38.870]
They just want to keep you safe by keeping you at home

[02:15:40.990 --> 02:15:43.410]
Watch, name interim coach for Spartans, uh oh

[02:15:44.090 --> 02:15:46.870]
Michigan State football coach Bobby Williams was fired yesterday

[02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:51.070]
Two days after the embarrassing Spartans dropped to 3 and 6 with their worst loss in 55 years

[02:15:51.070 --> 02:15:51.710]
Who cares?

[02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:55.070]
Williams won a four-black coach, uh oh, uh oh

[02:15:55.070 --> 02:15:57.770]
One of four black coaches Jesse ain't going to be happy with this

[02:15:57.770 --> 02:16:01.350]
Among the 117 schools in the Vision 1A football was informed of the firing

[02:16:01.350 --> 02:16:03.990]
After yesterday's practice by Vladimir Director Ron Mason

[02:16:04.530 --> 02:16:07.690]
A offensive coordinator Morris Watts was appointed interim head coach

[02:16:07.690 --> 02:16:10.530]
On Sunday, Jeff Smoker's family announced he suspended quarterback

[02:16:10.530 --> 02:16:12.850]
His battling substance abuse and his sought help

[02:16:13.550 --> 02:16:16.930]
That's why his name is Smoker, what's that, who's that the smoker we got in here?

[02:16:17.290 --> 02:16:20.030]
Richard Smoker, Mr. Richard does, is it Mr. Richard Smoker?

[02:16:20.110 --> 02:16:20.370]
To you?

[02:16:20.850 --> 02:16:23.090]
Who now is Mr. or Mr. Richard Smoker?

[02:16:23.350 --> 02:16:23.870]
Some fag

[02:16:24.530 --> 02:16:25.250]
Now seriously

[02:16:27.570 --> 02:16:29.270]
Who is it?

[02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:33.190]
Mr. Richard Smoker, you're a poopy poker

[02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:37.430]
Oh, this friend's calling Jeff

[02:16:38.910 --> 02:16:40.390]
Sugarheads and coffee brands

[02:16:40.390 --> 02:16:43.830]
One of those pipe smokers that Mokeh it's all upset about

[02:16:44.430 --> 02:16:50.410]
The same day, tailed back to Juan Moss was dismissed from the team after being arrested and accused of dragging a police officer with his car following a traffic stop

[02:16:50.410 --> 02:16:52.670]
Both smokers and Moss were captains

[02:16:52.670 --> 02:16:57.290]
A 49-3 loss had meagre in Saturday, dropped to Spartans, which was ranked as high as 15th position

[02:16:57.290 --> 02:16:59.690]
To one of four to big, then they stalked, okay, who cares?

[02:17:00.090 --> 02:17:00.950]
Who cares?

[02:17:01.370 --> 02:17:04.070]
Just more than that same insanity of college or football

[02:17:06.210 --> 02:17:08.730]
Get ready for it, Humper, they're going to really be all over you today

[02:17:08.730 --> 02:17:09.850]
We're about number three!

[02:17:10.630 --> 02:17:13.210]
We are cursed, man, we're not blessed anymore, we're cursed

[02:17:13.210 --> 02:17:18.070]
Volka Brian's got his beanie with the rotating propeller on it, we're all sitting here praying

[02:17:19.210 --> 02:17:23.470]
Here's the facts it says from James, the dolphins are providing us with much needed comic relief

[02:17:23.470 --> 02:17:26.850]
There are two words that remind me last night's performance, Gary O'Primian

[02:17:27.350 --> 02:17:30.050]
Ray Lucas should fax his resume to UPS right away

[02:17:30.050 --> 02:17:33.310]
Happy birthday, we are blessed, says Jay and Paul Met Obey

[02:17:33.310 --> 02:17:38.630]
While we used to be blessed Jay and our cursed, between the fixed elections, the things that won't

[02:17:38.630 --> 02:17:41.050]
And look at the markets of 63 points, what a coincidence

[02:17:41.050 --> 02:17:43.230]
You mark my words, you watch

[02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:49.190]
Maybe not tomorrow, but in days to come, all of this phony pumping up on the market, all this inflated crap

[02:17:49.190 --> 02:17:50.470]
You'll see where it's going to go

[02:17:51.550 --> 02:17:54.450]
Right down the tubes, here's Jimmy who says happy birthday, Neo

[02:17:54.450 --> 02:17:57.850]
I've been listening to you since 1988, nobody does it better

[02:17:57.850 --> 02:18:01.310]
The Mohawry Geldy bits are the greatest, voter from McBride and Hollywood today

[02:18:01.310 --> 02:18:06.010]
No problems, keep playing Condoleezza, maybe in an endless loop for Heather from Fox, says Jimmy

[02:18:06.010 --> 02:18:09.490]
Oh, I think we just had a little something special there for Heather from Fox

[02:18:09.490 --> 02:18:11.410]
I'm gonna play the other version of it

[02:18:12.590 --> 02:18:13.530]
There's another version?

[02:18:14.250 --> 02:18:14.650]
Yeah

[02:18:16.990 --> 02:18:18.490]
WQIM, once, QIM

[02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:20.450]
Hello

[02:18:20.450 --> 02:18:21.790]
Yes sir, hello

[02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:22.530]
Yes, hello

[02:18:22.530 --> 02:18:25.070]
Hey Neo, happy birthday, I'm coming from Washington, DC

[02:18:25.070 --> 02:18:25.810]
Thank you

[02:18:25.810 --> 02:18:28.410]
I escaped Florida in 1999 and I haven't had regretted it

[02:18:28.410 --> 02:18:29.170]
Good for you

[02:18:29.170 --> 02:18:34.390]
I'm now in the president of Maryland where we got a whole lot of shhh, well, whatever

[02:18:34.390 --> 02:18:34.850]
Yeah

[02:18:34.850 --> 02:18:37.050]
A lot of shooting going on

[02:18:37.050 --> 02:18:37.970]
Yeah, that too, doc

[02:18:39.390 --> 02:18:42.410]
Anyway, I usually call you from Amsterdam, but I'm leaving in two days, so

[02:18:42.410 --> 02:18:42.930]
Oh great

[02:18:42.930 --> 02:18:46.470]
I was wondering if you could recommend a shop there to go visit and mention your name

[02:18:47.470 --> 02:18:48.810]
I don't think so

[02:18:48.810 --> 02:18:49.970]
No, no

[02:18:49.970 --> 02:18:51.650]
Okay, well, you know, just a shop

[02:18:52.110 --> 02:18:55.730]
Anyway, happy birthday, hope you have many more and we're so glad to hear you on the radio

[02:18:55.730 --> 02:18:56.410]
Even though it's really

[02:18:56.410 --> 02:18:57.530]
Okay, tootsieens

[02:18:57.530 --> 02:18:57.950]
Yeah

[02:18:57.950 --> 02:18:59.330]
See ya

[02:18:59.330 --> 02:19:01.330]
Is there a coffee shop you could recommend?

[02:19:01.610 --> 02:19:04.870]
No, because I've never been in a coffee shop in my life, how do you like that?

[02:19:05.510 --> 02:19:08.310]
In spite of all my beggings and pleading for you to bring me a souvenir

[02:19:08.310 --> 02:19:09.210]
Oh yeah, right

[02:19:09.210 --> 02:19:13.370]
No, seriously, I've never been in a coffee shop, there's one right down the block from where I live, I told you they delivered to your house

[02:19:13.370 --> 02:19:14.710]
They got guys on motorcycles

[02:19:15.350 --> 02:19:17.870]
Unfortunately, the guys they have on motorcycles are ugly, so why, you know

[02:19:18.410 --> 02:19:21.730]
I can't even come to my house under the pretext that I wanted to buy some crap, but

[02:19:22.190 --> 02:19:23.710]
What you got to do is tape it around your abdomen

[02:19:24.210 --> 02:19:25.690]
Yeah, okay, express it work for him

[02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:26.350]
Okay

[02:19:28.290 --> 02:19:29.690]
5667 are just sticking in your...

[02:19:29.690 --> 02:19:30.090]
Correct him

[02:19:31.770 --> 02:19:33.990]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T line

[02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:37.250]
We're going to hour to go, man, polls are open, go out there and vote 20 or 30 times

[02:19:37.250 --> 02:19:40.750]
And they're going to do any good, I mean, and the result is already a foregone conclusion

[02:19:41.630 --> 02:19:45.850]
There is no, I mean, a fair election in the state of Florence and OxyMoron, there's no such thing

[02:19:47.010 --> 02:19:53.510]
I mean, it's depressing to say that, and I don't want to discourage anybody from voting, because at least you can say, well I gave him my best shot and you know, kill some good time

[02:19:54.550 --> 02:19:58.690]
But I'm not just talking about who's going to win or who's going to lose, it's just that all the elections here are fixed

[02:19:59.410 --> 02:19:59.970]
They're rigged

[02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:07.450]
I mean, you go to the polling place and you cast your vote for whoever, and then it comes up and says you didn't vote for anybody or you voted for the other guy, what does that tell you?

[02:20:07.630 --> 02:20:12.290]
You can go to the poll, wanted to vote for Al Gore and you want to put it for Pat Buchanan, what does that tell you?

[02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:13.150]
Huh?

[02:20:13.150 --> 02:20:17.330]
And that Theresa LaPourra up there with a goddamn butterfly ballot, she still got her job!

[02:20:18.650 --> 02:20:21.790]
Miriam Elephant, she still got her job because of her complication, you know what I'm saying?

[02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:30.950]
If she would have been a little about four shades lighter, she'd have had her as fire right now, with September the 11th, she'd have been a, what an interesting date too, by the way

[02:20:31.370 --> 02:20:33.330]
This past I'm talking about, she'd been out of there

[02:20:34.210 --> 02:20:40.110]
David Leahy, who happens to be white, but just incompetent, he's still in date like 100 years later, still bumbling things up

[02:20:41.170 --> 02:20:45.910]
See no matter what, they hold date, I like to do with Chicago, like in the 60 election at the Kennedy Stool

[02:20:46.530 --> 02:20:51.990]
And the last numbers that came in were from Cook County, which is Chicago because Dick Daily Headed, the fix was in, the fix was in with Dick

[02:20:53.990 --> 02:21:03.930]
And, instead of Cook County now, the last votes in the country come in from, even though we're in the Eastern time zone, you think it would be from the upper northwest, from the far west from Hawaii, from somewhere, from the Illusion Islands

[02:21:03.930 --> 02:21:08.110]
No, they come in from the Dave County, like on September 10th

[02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:16.210]
How is that possible? Why is it by like 10 or 11 o'clock tonight, all the votes aren't counted in Dave County, I want to, I want to answer right now, David Leahy

[02:21:16.210 --> 02:21:20.790]
You're incompetent, you should have been fired, just, we're gonna have Moe fire recess, is what we're gonna do

[02:21:21.710 --> 02:21:35.070]
Because when Moe gets after you man, you've had it, just ask Carolyn, just ask the beast, ask the poor beast who not only got candy in the morning by Moe, but then had the ultimate indignity where a friend tried that we're fighting tooth and ale to try to keep him as food from balance

[02:21:35.070 --> 02:21:37.490]
For like, tries trying to cut him off at the ass, a pass

[02:21:40.270 --> 02:21:46.270]
Discussing, the man loses almost 60 pounds, he's like a walking poster child, he's like the guy from subway, I keep forgetting his name with a Jared, Jared

[02:21:46.270 --> 02:21:46.930]
See, I told you

[02:21:47.330 --> 02:21:49.830]
I don't give me that, like, yeah, I'm not, I can't stand Jared

[02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:53.430]
Well, I don't either, but that's not the point, he's the poster child, he made him a lot of money

[02:21:54.490 --> 02:21:58.050]
And that's the point, here's the guy that was on the verge of death, who was a waddling tub of crap

[02:21:58.050 --> 02:22:01.530]
And I mean, just a waddling tub, he was like a schmoo with legs

[02:22:04.150 --> 02:22:05.690]
Yeah, a schmoo with legs

[02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:11.970]
And here we're saving his life, and well, we've exploited him as much as we can right now

[02:22:11.970 --> 02:22:14.870]
Hey, you guys, you guys are better with earrings in your thing

[02:22:15.770 --> 02:22:19.650]
You better get with it, you better take care of our friend, the beast, he's already gotten screwed over and off here

[02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:25.210]
Pathetic, but that's this town for you know, a lot of fair-weather friends, Troy

[02:22:26.110 --> 02:22:27.650]
And by the way, I don't eat fish

[02:22:28.410 --> 02:22:31.170]
Four minutes till what he laughing about, I don't eat fish

[02:22:31.170 --> 02:22:34.690]
So I've heard, how could they send me seafood in there? Oh my god

[02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.870]
Seafood

[02:22:36.650 --> 02:22:41.910]
I told you, the stench, just the smell of it long is enough to send me into orbit, into catatonic shock

[02:22:43.430 --> 02:22:43.790]
God

[02:22:44.810 --> 02:22:48.810]
Like in Boston, they've ever begun, they have all these open door, open door

[02:22:48.810 --> 02:22:52.070]
Open, uh, outdoor, air, air, air, air, air, scare

[02:22:53.090 --> 02:22:56.290]
And you walk through there and there's beautiful produce, and there's all kinds of great like

[02:22:56.290 --> 02:23:01.050]
uh, meats and steaks, and then you get to the seafood part, oh my god

[02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:06.090]
It smells like uh, Rosie O'Donnell just died on a sidewalk there

[02:23:06.810 --> 02:23:08.310]
Good, golly miss Molly

[02:23:09.930 --> 02:23:12.090]
Three minutes till noon at 5.60 QIM

[02:23:12.090 --> 02:23:15.170]
When you shop for quality food, where you go, you go to Brandeys and Pompato Beach

[02:23:15.170 --> 02:23:19.050]
Anybody knows that by now? Brandeys has been doing it for years in the same great location

[02:23:19.050 --> 02:23:20.950]
12.90 North Federal Highway and Pompato Beach

[02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:24.670]
Because they treat you great, they have the selection that's unbeatable anywhere

[02:23:24.670 --> 02:23:27.930]
And they've got the lowest prices in town, and sales holes, they know how to treat you right too

[02:23:27.930 --> 02:23:29.470]
And take good care of your tootsies

[02:23:29.470 --> 02:23:33.270]
So, move your tootsies on over to Brandeys, you'll find top quality names the best in the business

[02:23:33.270 --> 02:23:37.610]
Like rock ports, SAS, Sparies, Timberland naturalizer, and lots more

[02:23:37.610 --> 02:23:42.130]
And because they got such a big selection, then I'm going to say, oh sorry mister, we don't have your size and stock

[02:23:42.130 --> 02:23:44.170]
Whatever you're looking for, they got it, believe you may

[02:23:44.170 --> 02:23:46.630]
They're open daily nine to nine Sundays, 10 to five

[02:23:46.630 --> 02:23:50.170]
And of course, they're a specialist week like they have every week, all this week at Brandeys

[02:23:50.170 --> 02:23:55.490]
Take 20% off on all famous men and women's vote shoes, only at Brandeys this week in Pompato Beach

[02:23:58.290 --> 02:24:01.750]
We're sports radio 560, you AM

Time to get it on

[02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:09.490]
Where are you? It'd be at 12 to 1 hour on WQA

[02:24:09.490 --> 02:24:12.770]
Hey, Bob Funga, where are you?

[02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:27.670]
I heard you're getting married, heard you're all getting married, what a stupid thing to do

[02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:37.630]
I say as a friend, that marriage can be scary, should be those one fine sexy babe

[02:24:37.630 --> 02:24:46.810]
While you and what you have that way, and baby, what happens twice to me

[02:24:46.810 --> 02:24:55.090]
Will make you to unhappy, and baby, just as crappy for you

[02:24:55.630 --> 02:24:58.650]
Because it sucks to be married

[02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:06.930]
When do we have her on only WQA's Kenny? It's an all-expense babe, pre-knock you will agree, man

[02:25:07.650 --> 02:25:12.090]
Two luxurious days of electro shock therapy at pre-knock's lobotomy spa

[02:25:12.650 --> 02:25:18.610]
A complete set of porcelain dishes, a fine addition to any dining room, like wait and easy to throw

[02:25:18.610 --> 02:25:26.870]
And a solid wooden chair, and crafted and perfectly balanced for easy lifting when breaking them over each other's back

[02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:30.330]
We're gonna see a poivo, jacato and loi, 606, go down

realize that uh... you know democracy is dead it's all over

[02:26:18.730 --> 02:26:21.990]
pretty pressing message but it's the truth i mean if we want me to lie to you

[02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:24.530]
i'll tell you hey we get out there and you're really gonna make a big difference

[02:26:24.530 --> 02:26:27.390]
are we gonna make a difference no because the fixes already in

[02:26:27.390 --> 02:26:30.790]
here's a fact that says i think it's illegal to campaign within a hundred

[02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:32.930]
hundred feet from a point place over your previous college to listening

[02:26:32.930 --> 02:26:36.110]
those bush campaigners were breaking a lot of parking lot just like his son

[02:26:36.110 --> 02:26:39.070]
and his wife p.s. have a tom Brady birthday or i wish

[02:26:39.730 --> 02:26:43.270]
i wish i'll take the ice victory the huge smashing went over uh... sunday on

[02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:46.110]
over buffalo rather and then of course it often embarrassing loss of

[02:26:46.110 --> 02:26:48.770]
rebate last night nice quenna that's good enough and his daughter

[02:26:49.850 --> 02:26:51.250]
jabbush and you mama also

[02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:56.010]
jabbush is the florida's kennel is to end round rights tim Rosson

[02:26:56.010 --> 02:26:59.470]
error bookmarked not defined it seems governor jabbush spends most of his time

[02:26:59.470 --> 02:27:02.590]
these days running from one place to another to refute analyses reports and

[02:27:02.590 --> 02:27:06.050]
pulls that show his lack of leadership has run florida's economy into a ditch

[02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:09.350]
and broken the back of our public education system reports from such

[02:27:09.350 --> 02:27:11.950]
left wing think takes as the florida chamber of commerce that is

[02:27:12.570 --> 02:27:15.610]
justice kennel a hit and rons fiscal mismanagement from employees and

[02:27:15.610 --> 02:27:18.590]
investors it seems our governor will go to any likes to mislead to

[02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:22.170]
rittians about how the state's economy has gone from surpluses to deficits on

[02:27:22.170 --> 02:27:22.850]
his watch

[02:27:23.490 --> 02:27:26.390]
when jabbush took the reins of power nearly four years ago he spoke of

[02:27:26.390 --> 02:27:29.930]
lofty goals such as creating jobs more efficient government at award class

[02:27:29.930 --> 02:27:33.350]
education system now near the end of his term we're back to deficit spending

[02:27:33.350 --> 02:27:36.510]
our school systems at the bottom of the national pile and government

[02:27:36.510 --> 02:27:40.410]
graphed has become the order of the day after promising the most ethical

[02:27:40.410 --> 02:27:43.030]
administration history governor bushes overseen corruption and

[02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:46.790]
effitism run a muck in his administration it's now estimated that nearly

[02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:50.250]
forty percent of our forty eight billion dollar state budget gets kickback in

[02:27:50.250 --> 02:27:53.330]
the form of contracts with private companies many of which employer former

[02:27:53.330 --> 02:27:57.430]
bush staffers the accountability governor has undercut the oversight and

[02:27:57.430 --> 02:28:00.470]
accountability measures in our state contracts and bidding process he's even

[02:28:00.470 --> 02:28:03.710]
gone so far as to cut the funding for the state auditor general and the office

[02:28:03.710 --> 02:28:07.490]
of program policy analysis and government accountability to take our state so

[02:28:07.490 --> 02:28:10.490]
far back in only four years can only be one of two things grossing

[02:28:10.490 --> 02:28:15.230]
competence or willful mismanagement since n rons collapse the company is laid

[02:28:15.230 --> 02:28:18.690]
off about five thousand employees worldwide this international scandal

[02:28:18.690 --> 02:28:22.270]
pales in comparison to the job losses experienced in florida according to the

[02:28:22.270 --> 02:28:25.130]
bureau of labor statistics more than a hundred and sixty one thousand jobs

[02:28:25.130 --> 02:28:27.090]
have been lost in florida in the last year alone

[02:28:27.090 --> 02:28:31.390]
bush has single handedly cut more than seven thousand positions governor

[02:28:31.390 --> 02:28:34.110]
bushes quick to pass the buck claiming terror started laying for our budget

[02:28:34.110 --> 02:28:37.890]
woes in spite of the fact that a revenue estimating conference demonstrated

[02:28:37.890 --> 02:28:39.730]
as tax cuts for florida's wealthiest residents

[02:28:39.730 --> 02:28:42.930]
dug us into a six hundred and seventy two million dollar hole well before nine

[02:28:42.930 --> 02:28:46.690]
eleven bush recently stuffed his terrorism budget with so many turkeys

[02:28:46.690 --> 02:28:49.330]
that even the republican chair of the senate public security committee

[02:28:49.330 --> 02:28:52.390]
said people would laugh in our faces if we'd approved some of the governor's

[02:28:52.390 --> 02:28:55.570]
requests such as a quarter of a million dollars for a satellite tracking system

[02:28:55.570 --> 02:28:58.790]
for cows and half a million dollar kickback to a special interest group

[02:28:58.790 --> 02:29:03.050]
the print pamphlets on family preparedness the chair of the southeast florida

[02:29:03.050 --> 02:29:05.990]
security task force probably would have found these requests nothing less than

[02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:09.530]
amusing he has uh... rather found these requests less than amusing he said

[02:29:09.530 --> 02:29:12.810]
we assign patrols of florida ports because governor bush also cut national

[02:29:12.810 --> 02:29:15.590]
guard funding in spite of florida remaining under a heightened state of alert

[02:29:16.210 --> 02:29:19.490]
i suppose it somehow fitting that while florida's retirement system lost more than

[02:29:19.490 --> 02:29:21.030]
any other state in the in-run debacle

[02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:23.370]
jet personally benefited from his in-run stock

[02:29:23.370 --> 02:29:27.370]
in the end jab bush is youthful to turn a profit for his friends of expensive

[02:29:27.370 --> 02:29:30.870]
our future justice can lay use the employees investors in in-run

[02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:34.830]
in four short years florida's become the in-run estate governments and jab bush

[02:29:34.830 --> 02:29:38.330]
is our very own can lay what a great column there of course i didn't go to do any

[02:29:38.330 --> 02:29:40.930]
good because we got a bunch of people out there with closed ears and closed

[02:29:40.930 --> 02:29:43.270]
minds and no minds at all

[02:29:44.010 --> 02:29:46.510]
it makes you realize how hopeful it is is it is one of the main

[02:29:46.510 --> 02:29:49.010]
comes right out and says no matter what you vote on the goddamn

[02:29:49.010 --> 02:29:52.350]
a class size amendment i'm going to like deep six at any way i don't give a

[02:29:52.350 --> 02:29:56.930]
crap and all your facts out there baffon go to you too and all you darkies out

[02:29:56.930 --> 02:30:00.270]
there we're not going to let you vote basically that's what it boils down to

[02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:03.970]
and you'll see uh... you know the fact that in power which is the kind of that

[02:30:03.970 --> 02:30:04.970]
they got a fear the most

[02:30:05.890 --> 02:30:08.590]
that's where most of the problems lie i think it's just a coincidence no

[02:30:10.290 --> 02:30:14.590]
five six seven o five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t and four eyes in line

[02:30:15.550 --> 02:30:19.390]

And I just want to thank you for making my life enjoyable from in between all well thanks Marcel

[02:30:39.410 --> 02:30:40.790]
What are you doing these days?

[02:30:41.210 --> 02:30:43.530]
I'm going to tell a uniform company with I don't like uniforms.

[02:30:43.590 --> 02:30:44.170]
Oh great.

[02:30:44.330 --> 02:30:47.870]
So I can go by there and take care and customize a uniform for you.

[02:30:48.010 --> 02:30:50.510]
Okay, just make them like brown shirt stuff like that.

[02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:53.130]
Oh, by the way, that's my girlfriend's birthday.

[02:30:53.430 --> 02:30:53.610]
Yeah.

[02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:56.730]
So if you were to mind if you could do the birthday jingles for you and her.

[02:30:57.010 --> 02:30:58.690]
Oh my god Marcel.

[02:31:03.510 --> 02:31:04.510]
Okay, see you.

[02:31:05.170 --> 02:31:09.050]
That's old Shaolin Marshall used to bring us all those real fattening sounds with a

[02:31:09.050 --> 02:31:09.330]
marshmallow.

[02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:10.430]
Oh, I like them.

[02:31:10.590 --> 02:31:10.950]
They look great.

[02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:12.030]
That Ambrosia.

[02:31:12.130 --> 02:31:13.050]
Oh yeah, Ambrosia.

[02:31:13.150 --> 02:31:14.690]
I haven't had this stuff in a long time.

[02:31:15.050 --> 02:31:16.770]
Here's a little birthday present for me.

[02:31:16.850 --> 02:31:17.290]
It's Tom Willing.

[02:31:17.350 --> 02:31:18.790]
Don't forget smallville tonight at eight o'clock.

[02:31:19.150 --> 02:31:19.690]
I mean, not a clock.

[02:31:19.710 --> 02:31:20.530]
Whatever time it's on nine.

[02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:24.150]
Happy birthday Neil from smallville from Tom Willing.

[02:31:25.270 --> 02:31:29.050]
It says I went to the vote today and no, this is Tracy and Boko and aside from being

[02:31:29.050 --> 02:31:33.410]
the only person in the room under the age of 85, I'm 24, quite a gap and having listened

[02:31:33.410 --> 02:31:37.530]
to heartless seniors screaming each other for cutting in line, it meant they went all right.

[02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:41.270]
My democratic votes were counted correctly or so said to computer, I had no problems.

[02:31:41.530 --> 02:31:43.530]
Maybe Boko's too stupid even to get on the jet pitch.

[02:31:43.770 --> 02:31:44.690]
Keep on keeping on it.

[02:31:44.930 --> 02:31:45.810]
Tracy, thanks Tracy.

[02:31:46.650 --> 02:31:48.910]
Well, see I'm thinking Boko, they're going to be worried about it too much because they

[02:31:48.910 --> 02:31:51.650]
got, you know, well, they do have some old Jews up there.

[02:31:53.610 --> 02:31:54.610]
Brian had no problems.

[02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:57.550]
Brian had no problem, but he ate an old Jew, you know what I'm saying?

[02:31:57.910 --> 02:31:59.850]
He's just another train monkey.

[02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.770]
Yeah, that's all he is.

[02:32:01.950 --> 02:32:06.350]
Well, speaking of that, gay sheep may help explain biology of homosexuals.

[02:32:06.390 --> 02:32:09.670]
Gay sheep that made only with other rams have different brain structures from straight

[02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:11.610]
sheep, if I did, they may shed light on human sexuality.

[02:32:12.050 --> 02:32:16.270]
US researchers said yesterday the differences are similar to those seen in some homosexual

[02:32:16.270 --> 02:32:20.610]
humans, but probably only go a small way to explaining causes of different sexual preferences.

[02:32:20.610 --> 02:32:21.950]
But they go that word again.

[02:32:22.050 --> 02:32:26.030]
I thought that word was ancient and old sexual preferences of team and Oregon health and

[02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:30.030]
science university be saying we're not trying to explain human sexuality by the study.

[02:32:30.150 --> 02:32:34.090]
Charles was selling a professor of physiology and pharmacology who let the study sit in a

[02:32:34.090 --> 02:32:37.690]
telephone interview, whether this is a big component of what contributes in humans that's

[02:32:37.690 --> 02:32:41.910]
still debatable working with the team of US Department of Agriculture sheep experiment

[02:32:41.910 --> 02:32:46.450]
station Dubois Idaho Dubois Dubois.

[02:32:46.750 --> 02:32:47.930]
No, it's Dubois.

[02:32:47.930 --> 02:32:52.050]
I sure they do boys, but it's a French word Dubois Dubois Idaho.

[02:32:52.410 --> 02:32:56.790]
Resoli's team studied 27 sheep, 10 U's, 9 rams that made it only with other rams and 8

[02:32:56.790 --> 02:32:57.950]
rams that made it only with females.

[02:32:58.350 --> 02:33:01.010]
The gay sheep are strongly homosexual, Rosoli said.

[02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:03.130]
They don't pair a bond, but they're exclusive.

[02:33:03.550 --> 02:33:05.290]
They don't court or mate with the females.

[02:33:05.470 --> 02:33:06.570]
They only court mate with males.

[02:33:07.610 --> 02:33:11.290]
First the scientists watched the sheep to be sure their behavior, something cannot be done

[02:33:11.290 --> 02:33:11.610]
with humans.

[02:33:11.650 --> 02:33:12.490]
Well, why not?

[02:33:13.550 --> 02:33:15.170]
They took apart their brains.

[02:33:16.810 --> 02:33:20.750]
Their head and reports in humans that a certain area of the hypothalamus, the preoptic

[02:33:20.750 --> 02:33:22.650]
area, was large, usually larger in males than females.

[02:33:22.990 --> 02:33:26.070]
This area was also to be found larger in heterosexual humans than homosexual men.

[02:33:26.290 --> 02:33:27.650]
Maybe that's why I got such a small one.

[02:33:27.710 --> 02:33:28.250]
That could be it.

[02:33:28.750 --> 02:33:30.310]
That's your howl of hypothalmory.

[02:33:30.410 --> 02:33:30.610]
Yeah.

[02:33:31.050 --> 02:33:33.890]
It's my hypothec nervous thing.

[02:33:34.690 --> 02:33:37.770]
And based on a selection, what we're here and so far today, I'm getting nervous.

[02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:41.210]
Haven't heard any more of those reports yet.

[02:33:41.910 --> 02:33:44.630]
Of course, remember last year, it wasn't until like the middle of the afternoon, we started

[02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:45.650]
getting this stuff from Palm Beach.

[02:33:46.210 --> 02:33:49.010]
People just screaming and shrieking and carrying on about.

[02:33:49.290 --> 02:33:50.690]
I think I voted for Pat Buchanan.

[02:33:51.370 --> 02:33:52.230]
Oh my God.

[02:33:53.290 --> 02:33:58.150]
And he started, you know, I do enjoy that show on MSNBC 2-4 with Bill Press and my good

[02:33:58.150 --> 02:34:00.250]
old friend Pat, who's stepping Pat.

[02:34:00.670 --> 02:34:02.130]
But he started to revert to Form 9.

[02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:03.530]
Not that the election was come all year.

[02:34:04.010 --> 02:34:05.870]
He's making a while turn back to the right.

[02:34:07.290 --> 02:34:09.090]
I wanted to disappoint his constituents.

[02:34:09.630 --> 02:34:12.010]
10 past noon at 560 WQM.

[02:34:12.050 --> 02:34:15.050]
Our good buddy Jeff Cohen was on the phone before he says, he don't care who you vote for.

[02:34:15.130 --> 02:34:16.750]
If you vote it all, he wants your money.

[02:34:17.170 --> 02:34:22.010]
He wants to give you some great delicious food, big, big portions, teeny tiny prices, delicious

[02:34:22.010 --> 02:34:22.570]
and fresh.

[02:34:22.570 --> 02:34:23.750]
Forget about all this stress.

[02:34:24.130 --> 02:34:24.230]
Okay.

[02:34:24.510 --> 02:34:25.250]
Go into the pizza loft.

[02:34:25.390 --> 02:34:27.390]
You'd like to lay back atmosphere, the great service.

[02:34:27.390 --> 02:34:29.390]
And of course, like I said, delicious pasta.

[02:34:29.470 --> 02:34:31.370]
There'd be kind three different kinds of great pizza.

[02:34:31.770 --> 02:34:33.430]
Garlic rolls just dripping and garlic.

[02:34:33.430 --> 02:34:36.510]
In fact, you probably have to put a bib on because there's so much garlic coming.

[02:34:36.510 --> 02:34:37.230]
It's just fantastic.

[02:34:37.230 --> 02:34:41.430]
And all your favorite, the tight and favorites, chicken dishes, veal, seafood, calzone,

[02:34:41.650 --> 02:34:42.850]
super subs, Jeff's got it all.

[02:34:43.050 --> 02:34:44.450]
They do a stupendous job of catering.

[02:34:44.510 --> 02:34:46.110]
I don't forget, it's going to get a little confusing.

[02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:47.030]
Now, how do we do this?

[02:34:48.190 --> 02:34:48.510]
Huh?

[02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:49.590]
What?

[02:34:49.890 --> 02:34:53.170]
Well, no, because there's two locations that I don't want to like lean one way or the other.

[02:34:53.330 --> 02:34:54.830]
So to speak, give them both, like those sheep.

[02:34:55.270 --> 02:34:56.850]
I know, give them both, but how do you like?

[02:34:57.050 --> 02:35:02.370]
Anyway, in Davey, a university drive between Griffith and 595, that's the original Broward

[02:35:02.370 --> 02:35:06.170]
location, just a gigantic bunch of free parking air for you right in front of the joint.

[02:35:06.170 --> 02:35:10.630]
Right near the Armando Cafe, right behind Pier 1 imports on university for takeout for delivery

[02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:18.510]
for catering at that location, call 954 916, 88, 80, 954 916, 88, 80 and the brand new,

[02:35:18.770 --> 02:35:22.950]
and I'm not going to say it is now because I'm not going to say it's behind that place.

[02:35:23.450 --> 02:35:23.590]
No.

[02:35:23.890 --> 02:35:26.430]
The brand new pizza loft is on the corner of Navajo and Sunrise.

[02:35:26.970 --> 02:35:29.770]
It's right behind that, that drugstore there.

[02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:31.150]
Yeah, right behind them.

[02:35:31.850 --> 02:35:35.470]
And the phone number there for takeout delivery and catering at the brand new plantation

[02:35:35.470 --> 02:35:43.090]
pizza loft is 954 3a2 1999 3a2 1999, same great food, same low prices and a great ambiance

[02:35:43.090 --> 02:35:46.590]
to maybe really lucky enough to see ponytail in there or get really lucky and not.

[02:35:47.070 --> 02:35:50.710]
And don't forget holidays coming up soon, free anal vibrators for all at the world famous

[02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:51.490]
pizza loft.

[02:36:01.130 --> 02:36:04.410]
And now I waited from our good friends at Winkercock to travel.

[02:36:04.890 --> 02:36:08.770]
Aspen Colorado, that's the place to go if you like skiing.

[02:36:09.230 --> 02:36:14.550]
Imagine for a moment you're on the slope, you put your knees together, bend slightly

[02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:19.510]
forwards and then you grab your pole while you put the other hand on the edge of the

[02:36:19.510 --> 02:36:20.050]
table.

[02:36:24.730 --> 02:36:25.830]
This is unacceptable.

[02:36:26.570 --> 02:36:27.390]
Who wrote this?

[02:36:27.650 --> 02:36:28.550]
I think it was time.

[02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:30.290]
Ah, and I'm not Mr. Zipgode.

[02:36:30.750 --> 02:36:32.770]
I know who's responsible for this sabotage.

[02:36:33.370 --> 02:36:38.330]
This is the heavy work that I thank at you, poof, in that train guamal of a monkey of his.

[02:36:38.670 --> 02:36:39.810]
The jokes on them.

[02:36:40.210 --> 02:36:41.110]
Well, have you know?

[02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:43.390]
I got connections in New York.

[02:37:03.950 --> 02:37:07.370]
I'm here to demand that you grant me a favor.

[02:37:07.370 --> 02:37:09.950]
I want a sink in a head on the oratics.

[02:37:10.050 --> 02:37:12.730]
What have I done to be treated with such disrespect?

[02:37:13.470 --> 02:37:16.010]
Oh Godfather, that the end of my rope.

[02:37:16.570 --> 02:37:23.250]
Every day they got me raped and used in my name and vain and just making fun of my

[02:37:23.250 --> 02:37:23.770]
veins.

[02:37:24.110 --> 02:37:27.610]
I said, no, it's in here, and we can I know.

[02:37:27.890 --> 02:37:29.250]
You can act like a man.

[02:37:29.890 --> 02:37:31.670]
You know who I am.

[02:37:31.870 --> 02:37:33.830]
You're a man who deserves respect.

[02:37:34.350 --> 02:37:35.890]
So here's a ticket to Vegas.

[02:37:35.970 --> 02:37:36.250]
Vegas?

[02:37:36.630 --> 02:37:37.410]
Who needs fame?

[02:37:37.590 --> 02:37:37.990]
Get me fame.

[02:37:38.190 --> 02:37:39.350]
I already live in paradise.

[02:37:39.430 --> 02:37:42.030]
I ask you don't talk to a man like Boat with like that.

[02:37:42.210 --> 02:37:45.010]
I want you to take care of our friend Mr. Moe over here.

[02:37:45.090 --> 02:37:45.490]
Sure, Pop.

[02:37:45.850 --> 02:37:47.150]
Okay, take your pants off, fella.

[02:37:47.410 --> 02:37:48.330]
Let me show you a good time.

[02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:50.150]
Could your hands off me, you big dummy?

[02:37:50.470 --> 02:37:51.110]
I ain't dumb.

[02:37:51.370 --> 02:37:52.330]
God, dumb, you stupid.

[02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:53.630]
Yeah, but not like they say.

[02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:55.570]
Give me a hand here where you look at me.

[02:37:55.810 --> 02:37:56.850]
I am honest, I hate crick.

[02:37:57.090 --> 02:37:59.030]
Shabby Cowlin is not the key for quiet, okay?

[02:37:59.810 --> 02:38:00.190]
Uh-huh.

[02:38:01.170 --> 02:38:01.890]
And fattening.

[02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:04.050]

[02:38:20.950 --> 02:38:20.950]

[02:38:20.950 --> 02:38:20.950]

[02:38:20.950 --> 02:38:20.950]

[02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:03.470]
i'd like to see that thing just start going by itself on top of brine's head

uh... i recently moved

[02:40:25.350 --> 02:40:29.150]
and not being a consistent voter i went over to my old place in oakland park

[02:40:29.150 --> 02:40:30.630]
to find out what my new

[02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:32.390]
pulling it uh... place right

[02:40:33.090 --> 02:40:36.350]
while the church that i went to where he's to vote sent me over to the library

[02:40:36.350 --> 02:40:38.010]
because they said they did a redistricting

[02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:41.490]
so i go over to the library they couldn't find my name on the list

[02:40:42.530 --> 02:40:46.370]
the supervisor says well let me call and find out they take my name my new address

[02:40:46.370 --> 02:40:49.690]
they say well your number sixty five x they pulled up on the chart

[02:40:50.410 --> 02:40:53.590]
and it's on some road called pastadena lakes bullivore

[02:40:53.590 --> 02:40:55.350]
somewhere in the point

[02:40:56.050 --> 02:40:58.790]
so i say well can i get directions to that if i really don't know the neighbor

[02:40:58.790 --> 02:41:00.370]
that will yet so the guy goes well

[02:41:01.010 --> 02:41:01.990]
i don't know where it is

[02:41:01.990 --> 02:41:03.770]
so let me call my supervisor

[02:41:03.770 --> 02:41:05.330]

how do you like that there's another stir up sure there are thousands and

[02:41:47.070 --> 02:41:49.610]
thousands and thousands of stories by the end of the day

[02:41:50.270 --> 02:41:53.510]
people try to exercise their american right and they keep saying oh you got a

[02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:56.210]
vote it's your civic duty here by the bottom of the public doesn't care

[02:41:56.210 --> 02:41:59.470]
how do you expect to buy a course that's all about your crap anyway

[02:41:59.470 --> 02:42:01.870]
because they don't want more people to vote because then it becomes like

[02:42:01.870 --> 02:42:04.410]
uh... too dangerous it's the right to control and fix that way

[02:42:05.050 --> 02:42:06.490]
when too many people actually show up

[02:42:07.230 --> 02:42:10.530]
you know like a hundred thousand people vote in the uh... certain area

[02:42:10.530 --> 02:42:13.270]
and then they got like five thousand votes it's kind of hard to explain where

[02:42:13.270 --> 02:42:14.670]
they are ninety five thousand when

[02:42:16.910 --> 02:42:17.750]

son of a pretty doodah from the south

[02:42:43.090 --> 02:42:46.310]

[02:42:48.490 --> 02:42:50.830]

See, I'm thinking about Thursdays.

[02:52:07.630 --> 02:52:09.950]
It was like almost a real radio station working on IOT.

[02:52:10.150 --> 02:52:12.410]
I mean, here we don't pretend to be a real radio station.

[02:52:12.490 --> 02:52:14.170]
We're just like a money machine.

[02:52:15.070 --> 02:52:17.150]
Just give us the money, throw it out of the door, okay?

[02:52:17.470 --> 02:52:17.670]
Don't forget to check out the other one.

[02:52:17.670 --> 02:52:17.670]

[02:52:17.670 --> 02:52:17.670]

[02:52:17.670 --> 02:52:17.670]

[02:52:17.670 --> 02:52:17.670]

[02:52:17.670 --> 02:52:17.670]

[02:52:17.670 --> 02:52:18.910]
What's the father of?

[02:52:20.990 --> 02:52:22.250]
What's blood casting?

[02:52:23.530 --> 02:52:24.310]
What's blood casting?

[02:52:25.110 --> 02:52:26.490]
Throw it when it's hard to make.

[02:52:29.750 --> 02:52:31.010]
You better fish or bake.

[02:52:31.630 --> 02:52:33.130]
Cut bait or how that goes.

[02:52:34.190 --> 02:52:35.250]
Or you get off the pot.

[02:52:35.590 --> 02:52:35.670]
Yeah.

[02:52:37.970 --> 02:52:38.830]
Pull me once.

[02:52:41.210 --> 02:52:42.290]
You can pull me again.

[02:52:42.630 --> 02:52:42.630]

[02:52:43.510 --> 02:52:45.190]
I guess you figured that out.

[02:52:45.270 --> 02:52:45.810]
He fooled us once.

[02:52:45.930 --> 02:52:46.730]
He's got a fool us again.

[02:52:47.130 --> 02:52:47.650]
It's fooling someone.

[02:52:47.650 --> 02:52:47.650]

[02:52:47.650 --> 02:52:47.650]

[02:52:47.650 --> 02:52:47.650]

[02:52:47.650 --> 02:52:47.650]

[02:52:47.650 --> 02:52:47.650]

[02:52:47.650 --> 02:52:47.650]

[02:52:47.650 --> 02:52:47.650]

[02:52:47.650 --> 02:52:47.650]

[02:52:47.650 --> 02:52:47.650]

[02:52:47.650 --> 02:52:47.650]

[02:52:47.650 --> 02:52:49.810]
Anyways, what can you do?

[02:52:49.950 --> 02:52:50.530]
Nothing you can do.

[02:52:50.630 --> 02:52:52.490]
Just have a smile on your face, do the best you can,

[02:52:52.610 --> 02:52:54.590]
and stay out of this place as much as possible.

[02:52:56.990 --> 02:52:57.630]
WQA and hello.

[02:52:58.370 --> 02:52:58.830]
Hey, Neil.

[02:52:58.990 --> 02:52:59.430]
Happy birthday.

[02:52:59.590 --> 02:53:00.130]
Thank you, sir.

[02:53:00.850 --> 02:53:02.770]
I'm a cun and I went out and got my vote done,

[02:53:02.950 --> 02:53:03.930]
so I feel good about that.

[02:53:04.070 --> 02:53:04.530]
Oh, right.

[02:53:05.090 --> 02:53:08.090]
Don't like to hear this news, though, about all the people voting for me,

[02:53:08.150 --> 02:53:09.510]
brides, and showing up on Bush.

[02:53:09.810 --> 02:53:11.790]
Yeah, there's something really strange about that.

[02:53:12.410 --> 02:53:12.690]
Yeah.

[02:53:13.170 --> 02:53:14.850]
Interesting thing happened to me yesterday.

[02:53:15.350 --> 02:53:17.570]
It kind of made me get the day through, you know,

[02:53:18.230 --> 02:53:21.570]
I'm driving down US one in between coregables and a cookin' a grove.

[02:53:21.710 --> 02:53:21.810]
Mm-hmm.

[02:53:22.190 --> 02:53:24.890]
Of course, you show the people out there with their, you know,

[02:53:24.990 --> 02:53:27.410]
little stickers and holding up a little postures and all that,

[02:53:27.550 --> 02:53:28.130]
Jeff and all that.

[02:53:28.390 --> 02:53:28.390]

[02:53:28.390 --> 02:53:29.970]
I drive by and who do I see?

[02:53:31.010 --> 02:53:33.570]
But Ramon, Saul, Sanchez, and up a book.

[02:53:34.090 --> 02:53:34.330]
Ah.

[02:53:34.710 --> 02:53:36.690]
You talking about uptucking the lunch real quick.

[02:53:36.790 --> 02:53:37.490]
Oh, my God.

[02:53:37.910 --> 02:53:40.230]
So I go by and I figure it's a light,

[02:53:40.410 --> 02:53:41.890]
so I'm going to go ahead and mess with them a little bit.

[02:53:42.250 --> 02:53:44.690]
He had a probably conglogyment of about, you know,

[02:53:44.810 --> 02:53:47.550]
eight or nine of the blue, green tooth people and all that stuff.

[02:53:48.490 --> 02:53:51.510]
I'm not the pull off and I start honking and they think that I'm like, you know,

[02:53:51.650 --> 02:53:52.390]
giving support.

[02:53:52.610 --> 02:53:56.630]
And part of something I look at them and I wait for him to look at me and I stick my middle finger up at him.

[02:53:56.670 --> 02:53:57.090]
I ride.

[02:53:57.230 --> 02:53:57.490]
I ride.

[02:53:59.570 --> 02:53:59.890]
Excellent.

[02:54:00.310 --> 02:54:02.310]
That's what Black and traffic two years, three years ago.

[02:54:02.470 --> 02:54:04.170]
You made me so glad to have you in frustrated.

[02:54:04.810 --> 02:54:06.250]
Also one last thing, Neil.

[02:54:06.330 --> 02:54:08.470]
I wouldn't be doing it in that hood again next time.

[02:54:08.470 --> 02:54:10.410]
Though we'll probably find you hanging from a tree down there.

[02:54:11.050 --> 02:54:12.650]
Yeah, probably from my uncle up there, too.

[02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:12.910]
Right.

[02:54:12.910 --> 02:54:17.030]
Hey, Neil, does the same sort of remind you of Clementa a little bit?

[02:54:17.110 --> 02:54:17.870]
A little bit.

[02:54:18.050 --> 02:54:20.930]
And also, hey, could you put it in a Jewish Clemenza?

[02:54:22.430 --> 02:54:24.150]
You throw it a couple of sausage and peppers.

[02:54:24.790 --> 02:54:29.230]
Hey, also, hey, could you play the rosy bed with the match potato use?

[02:54:29.410 --> 02:54:30.030]
You got it.

[02:54:30.170 --> 02:54:30.730]
I like dealing with it.

[02:54:30.730 --> 02:54:31.110]
See ya.

[02:54:31.810 --> 02:54:32.750]
That's one of my favorites.

[02:54:32.910 --> 02:54:33.950]
I'm sure Gladi, we requested that.

[02:54:34.030 --> 02:54:34.990]
That's one of my all-time favorites.

[02:54:35.150 --> 02:54:36.750]
Not as much as written on a subway wall.

[02:54:37.030 --> 02:54:37.370]
It's by deal.

[02:54:38.250 --> 02:54:39.230]
I do like that a lot.

[02:54:40.130 --> 02:54:40.910]
I can listen to that.

[02:54:40.950 --> 02:54:41.690]
And I don't want to listen to that.

[02:54:41.750 --> 02:54:42.790]
I want to listen to the mad dog.

[02:54:42.790 --> 02:54:45.490]
Go on and talk about how great, great Lucas play last night.

[02:54:46.270 --> 02:54:47.670]
Oh, he ain't going to say that, is he?

[02:54:47.750 --> 02:54:47.890]
No.

[02:54:48.030 --> 02:54:48.230]
No.

[02:54:49.250 --> 02:54:53.210]
If that's playing great, I'd hate to see what we already saw what playing bad was the last game,

[02:54:53.370 --> 02:54:53.790]
Buffalo game.

[02:54:54.990 --> 02:54:56.850]
But I mean, that was not what I considered great.

[02:54:59.170 --> 02:55:00.130]
Nevertheless, time will tell.

[02:55:00.250 --> 02:55:00.550]
We'll see.

[02:55:00.710 --> 02:55:01.570]
There are a lot of games.

[02:55:01.670 --> 02:55:03.630]
And then people say, oh, we hated them all along anyway.

[02:55:05.330 --> 02:55:05.930]
What am I doing?

[02:55:06.030 --> 02:55:07.110]
Why do I want to play that now?

[02:55:07.250 --> 02:55:08.610]
I thought that I'm going to hurt you to get out of here.

[02:55:08.610 --> 02:55:11.410]
You understand, but on your birthday, aren't you supposed to leave a couple hours early?

[02:55:11.510 --> 02:55:12.070]
It would seem the same.

[02:55:12.190 --> 02:55:13.330]
A big party to go to.

[02:55:13.390 --> 02:55:13.770]
Very least.

[02:55:13.950 --> 02:55:18.910]
And how come those damn batteries take so long to charge up for a great digital camera that George bought me from my birthday?

[02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:22.070]
Which are real anxious to be taking pictures of most peace with that?

[02:55:22.310 --> 02:55:24.850]
I'm going to stand right in there tomorrow morning and start saffons and shots.

[02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:27.690]
And we can put them right on our website too.

[02:55:27.850 --> 02:55:28.010]
Right.

[02:55:28.410 --> 02:55:29.550]
Every day we can have a different one.

[02:55:29.770 --> 02:55:32.930]
The Puse one and the Brindle Brown one and the other one.

[02:55:32.970 --> 02:55:34.610]
Oh, I forgot that's on the Berkow's veins.

[02:55:36.290 --> 02:55:37.210]
W-Q-I-M.

[02:55:38.010 --> 02:55:38.810]
Leo, father.

[02:55:39.190 --> 02:55:39.550]
Yes, sir.

[02:55:39.970 --> 02:55:40.410]
What's up, bro?

[02:55:40.690 --> 02:55:40.950]
How you doing?

[02:55:41.430 --> 02:55:41.930]
All right.

[02:55:42.110 --> 02:55:44.950]
Let me just relay my election story to you.

[02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.310]
Okay.

[02:55:45.750 --> 02:55:47.410]
Back in the front of the entry election.

[02:55:47.770 --> 02:55:52.670]
Now, I know you totally disagree with my political views, but it was very important for me to get clicked in out of office.

[02:55:52.970 --> 02:55:54.350]
And I voted for Bush.

[02:55:55.450 --> 02:55:59.610]
And I made very sure that my statins didn't hang in, that nothing was dangling.

[02:55:59.910 --> 02:56:05.190]
I literally took it out of the machine and checked it on the back before I would put it back.

[02:56:05.190 --> 02:56:07.770]
Did you have a dangling participle on there?

[02:56:08.170 --> 02:56:08.970]
Not a participle.

[02:56:08.970 --> 02:56:09.290]
Okay.

[02:56:09.710 --> 02:56:10.170]
A testicle.

[02:56:11.430 --> 02:56:15.730]
Anyway, nothing of it is the problems that are built into the system.

[02:56:15.950 --> 02:56:17.110]
They go both ways.

[02:56:17.390 --> 02:56:21.750]
If there was mistakes cast for Bush, then how's that been mistakes cast for Bush?

[02:56:24.130 --> 02:56:25.050]
Say that again.

[02:56:26.210 --> 02:56:30.690]
If there was mistakes in both cast for Bush, then there had to have been mistakes in both cast for Bush too.

[02:56:32.270 --> 02:56:36.050]
I mean, probably a bunch of old gay guys like you voted for Bush.

[02:56:36.050 --> 02:56:36.670]
Okay. There you go.

[02:56:36.770 --> 02:56:36.870]
Yeah.

[02:56:38.010 --> 02:56:41.090]
Here's the fact that did you buy any chance, catch Donahue last night?

[02:56:41.190 --> 02:56:41.650]
What a show.

[02:56:42.050 --> 02:56:43.170]
He had Chris Matthews on.

[02:56:43.230 --> 02:56:44.950]
It was quite apparent that Chris doesn't like Phil.

[02:56:45.170 --> 02:56:46.870]
I thought they were actually going to come to blows.

[02:56:47.270 --> 02:56:51.890]
I was proud to see Chris speak so harshly about going into Iraq and how he's going to be a black mark on the Western history.

[02:56:52.230 --> 02:56:52.770]
Another Vietnam.

[02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:56.110]
One called into the show and mentioned anti-war rally in DC last weekend.

[02:56:56.450 --> 02:57:00.470]
She claimed there were over 200,000 people there, but the press was too afraid to cover it.

[02:57:00.470 --> 02:57:08.210]
One thing Chris Matthews said haunted me, he said talk about GW avenging his father, just wait to see what all the fathers of the dead civilians in Iraq will do.

[02:57:08.910 --> 02:57:15.450]
When Donahue came back from his last break, Chris was gone and Phil said some stupid excuse like he had to get ready for a special to our election special.

[02:57:15.670 --> 02:57:16.450]
It was amusing.

[02:57:16.790 --> 02:57:17.690]
Today don't like each other.

[02:57:17.790 --> 02:57:18.310]
How do you like that?

[02:57:19.730 --> 02:57:24.370]
He's probably still pissed off at Phil for that rough native crap and you know what's all the rest of us too.

[02:57:25.470 --> 02:57:26.890]
That was from Michael Moore too.

[02:57:26.990 --> 02:57:30.950]
We like most of your crap Michael, but the the native thing this we cannot forgive.

[02:57:33.290 --> 02:57:37.090]
That's what put GW in there right now and that's why he's sitting in there right now.

[02:57:38.750 --> 02:57:46.830]
Dricken is eating his chat to Brian and drinking his expensive wine because some assholes voted for Ralph later.

[02:57:47.010 --> 02:57:48.170]
Another guy on an ego trip.

[02:57:48.170 --> 02:57:50.110]
He's like the Bob Kunst of something.

[02:57:50.110 --> 02:57:54.150]
You know the Bob Kunst of the once real world.

[02:57:54.650 --> 02:57:55.830]
I'm going to sneeze real bad.

[02:57:55.970 --> 02:57:58.630]
I don't know whether like wait till I do it or just do it in the middle of the spot.

[02:57:58.710 --> 02:57:58.790]
No.

[02:57:59.110 --> 02:57:59.470]
Ah.

[02:58:00.150 --> 02:58:00.510]
Ah.

[02:58:02.770 --> 02:58:03.130]
Ah.

[02:58:03.150 --> 02:58:03.150]

[02:58:03.570 --> 02:58:04.150]
Oh good one.

[02:58:05.250 --> 02:58:06.030]
Twenty till one.

[02:58:06.130 --> 02:58:07.210]
Oh, and I feel so much better now.

[02:58:07.310 --> 02:58:08.370]
Thanks again Dr. Hanf.

[02:58:08.410 --> 02:58:09.270]
Well, she cleaned out.

[02:58:09.810 --> 02:58:09.990]
Seriously.

[02:58:10.630 --> 02:58:13.630]
Do you have any idea your laughing, but this is serious business.

[02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:16.050]
How many years have I must have had that sinus infection?

[02:58:16.870 --> 02:58:17.050]
100.

[02:58:17.470 --> 02:58:19.670]
I would say at least two 300 at least.

[02:58:21.130 --> 02:58:26.290]
Constantly getting these damn colds and scratchy throats and f***ing all that stuff speaking of Rosie.

[02:58:28.390 --> 02:58:33.050]
But she didn't mirror because she stuck that thing way up in there and looked around looked at this looked at that.

[02:58:34.770 --> 02:58:37.510]
Give me those antibiotics and when a doctor knocked her right out.

[02:58:37.770 --> 02:58:38.390]
Thanks a lot Doc.

[02:58:38.770 --> 02:58:40.650]
Even thanks to remember for getting me that good doctor.

[02:58:41.170 --> 02:58:45.190]
Too good doctors he's got me this year and then of course there was always Mitch Hirsch.

[02:58:46.050 --> 02:58:48.290]
19 to one at five sixty WQM.

[02:58:48.290 --> 02:58:53.470]
Hey, if your ball spot is getting bigger and bigger if you try to cover it up with some silly your alchemy with a propeller on top of it.

[02:58:53.730 --> 02:58:56.670]
The answer is chuck alphiri for over 25 years.

[02:58:56.750 --> 02:58:58.770]
Tell you it's been helping guys get their hair back.

[02:58:59.590 --> 02:59:00.390]
I see more and more.

[02:59:00.510 --> 02:59:04.510]
The Sam Donaldson was on with the King Meister a few nights ago and you look at him and you want to cry.

[02:59:04.690 --> 02:59:05.530]
You don't want to laugh anymore.

[02:59:05.610 --> 02:59:06.230]
You just want to cry.

[02:59:06.510 --> 02:59:08.530]
How can a grown man walk around looking like that?

[02:59:10.030 --> 02:59:11.510]
And the same with some people around here.

[02:59:11.550 --> 02:59:13.670]
We don't want to mention no names, but you can use your own imagination.

[02:59:13.670 --> 02:59:16.310]
If you want to look like a silly goose, be what my guess.

[02:59:16.490 --> 02:59:19.050]
But if you want to look better and younger than you ever thought you might again.

[02:59:19.410 --> 02:59:25.410]
Chuck's alphiri natural hairline system looks better than anything yet because it looks like the hair is grown around on your scalp.

[02:59:25.850 --> 02:59:28.310]
It's 100% undetectable like the natural thing.

[02:59:28.770 --> 02:59:32.070]
So pick up the phone and call him at 1-800-321-2413.

[02:59:32.310 --> 02:59:34.210]
See there I go again with that pick up the phone crap.

[02:59:34.570 --> 02:59:38.750]
And if you mention the orange as you get you a special 200 dollar WQM discount off the regular price.

[02:59:38.870 --> 02:59:42.970]
You got nothing loose but that ugly glaring shiny ball spot because if you don't love you.

[02:59:42.970 --> 02:59:44.370]
It's a word for 30 days. That's how it works.

[02:59:44.670 --> 02:59:46.270]
If you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells.

[02:59:46.570 --> 02:59:48.490]
If you're not getting ahead at least 14 times a day.

[02:59:48.750 --> 02:59:50.410]
Just say hey Charlie, here's your hair back.

[02:59:50.510 --> 02:59:51.710]
You're going to be my money back. No problems.

[02:59:52.130 --> 02:59:54.210]
1-800-321-2413.

[02:59:54.210 --> 02:59:54.870]
Call him today.

[02:59:54.930 --> 02:59:55.550]
There's no obligation.

[02:59:55.890 --> 02:59:59.610]
Or check out their website if you prefer at CharlesAlphieri.com.

[02:59:59.770 --> 03:00:01.510]
My name is Michael.

[03:00:01.870 --> 03:00:06.170]
This is 4256-1-2-A-M.

[03:00:07.770 --> 03:00:09.090]
The honey, Julia.

[03:00:15.510 --> 03:00:17.970]
Oh, that has roly-pleas go away.

[03:00:19.750 --> 03:00:23.950]
Find a new way to attack up a fake go-hole.

[03:00:24.830 --> 03:00:26.290]
Eat your whole holes.

[03:00:28.090 --> 03:00:29.610]
Till you explode.

[03:00:31.270 --> 03:00:33.970]
Just like your fat fat churly ladies.

[03:00:35.190 --> 03:00:37.210]
Have to bite your seats on a plane.

[03:00:38.170 --> 03:00:42.590]
He's failing your fingers that have yellow stain from sea to

[03:00:43.210 --> 03:00:44.850]
Can't see your toes.

[03:00:46.350 --> 03:00:48.050]
After picky puno.

[03:00:49.490 --> 03:00:53.130]
Have to be fat disgusting and tasty.

[03:00:53.770 --> 03:00:55.970]
Oh, he's crazy.

[03:00:57.370 --> 03:01:00.230]
You make the show a different smile.

[03:01:01.110 --> 03:01:04.590]
They like a cow who's fat and sad thing.

[03:01:04.590 --> 03:01:07.930]
Think smelly, bad soul, or you pulse a bit mild.

[03:01:08.650 --> 03:01:12.010]
Your body cheese smells like a crap butt.

[03:01:12.350 --> 03:01:15.690]
After it was occupied by head, pass nerdy.

[03:01:15.710 --> 03:01:17.990]
Push you more to get into your car.

[03:01:18.430 --> 03:01:21.070]
Cus you've got M.Y.

[03:01:23.270 --> 03:01:28.690]
Onkin' squeal, onkin' squeal, onkin' squeal fat ladies.

[03:01:29.170 --> 03:01:31.110]
Live in with your loverless means.

[03:01:31.110 --> 03:01:36.110]
A sliver in its door to the tree between her knees.

[03:01:37.050 --> 03:01:38.710]
That's my tail of yeast.

[03:01:40.550 --> 03:01:42.150]
It smells fishy to me.

[03:01:43.910 --> 03:01:48.630]
Happen up until that moist and tasty fae.

[03:01:52.470 --> 03:01:54.830]
It's 1247. That is one of my old time favorites.

[03:01:54.970 --> 03:01:57.110]
All of them, one of my new favorites, is coming up again in a moment.

[03:01:57.110 --> 03:01:57.990]
I'm a terrible smite, in fact.

[03:01:58.530 --> 03:02:00.250]
We really do need to play that again, don't we?

[03:02:01.470 --> 03:02:02.190]
598 votes.

[03:02:02.370 --> 03:02:04.830]
How did I back myself up into this like that now?

[03:02:05.030 --> 03:02:05.630]
How did I do that?

[03:02:06.170 --> 03:02:06.770]
I don't know what.

[03:02:07.550 --> 03:02:09.390]
Because it's almost time for the next break again.

[03:02:10.950 --> 03:02:13.230]
Oh, well, we've got to take a color to make it look good.

[03:02:13.870 --> 03:02:15.350]
598 votes on Moe.

[03:02:15.410 --> 03:02:17.350]
Who's Moe Howard, David, 206?

[03:02:17.350 --> 03:02:19.310]
Fire is old, as 152.

[03:02:19.850 --> 03:02:21.290]
Steel is to Pays 98.

[03:02:21.610 --> 03:02:23.490]
He gets raked in it by the whole staff 52.

[03:02:24.230 --> 03:02:26.050]
Banish him from Paradise 38.

[03:02:26.450 --> 03:02:29.990]
No penalty gets a gold start of Purple Jelly Bean 30.

[03:02:30.470 --> 03:02:32.390]
And he gets raked by Fricky Carlos 22.

[03:02:33.430 --> 03:02:34.930]
Jeff, what's that guy's name?

[03:02:35.030 --> 03:02:36.230]
The $6 million man.

[03:02:37.110 --> 03:02:38.890]
There's A1 King size sandwiches.

[03:02:39.390 --> 03:02:41.210]
Jeff, oh, it's on the tip of my tongue.

[03:02:42.010 --> 03:02:42.850]
God dang.

[03:02:44.050 --> 03:02:44.530]
WDQIM.

[03:02:45.330 --> 03:02:45.730]
Hello.

[03:02:46.070 --> 03:02:46.490]
Yes, sir.

[03:02:46.970 --> 03:02:48.230]
Oh, am I talking to Neil?

[03:02:48.250 --> 03:02:49.330]
Yes, ma'am.

[03:02:49.470 --> 03:02:50.830]
Neil, just hi.

[03:02:51.210 --> 03:02:54.110]
I want to wish you a happy birthday and many blessings for the year.

[03:02:54.330 --> 03:02:54.590]
Thanks.

[03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:55.290]
Stay well.

[03:02:55.670 --> 03:02:56.610]
Thank you.

[03:02:57.010 --> 03:02:57.610]
Bye-bye.

[03:02:58.290 --> 03:02:59.030]
Well, she was very nice.

[03:02:59.190 --> 03:03:01.950]
She just, she realized that we had to do the next break and we're up against the clocks.

[03:03:01.950 --> 03:03:03.730]
She did a short call, right?

[03:03:04.390 --> 03:03:04.610]
Right.

[03:03:05.730 --> 03:03:06.130]
Right.

[03:03:07.910 --> 03:03:08.310]
WDQIM.

[03:03:09.110 --> 03:03:10.010]
Neil, how you doing?

[03:03:10.150 --> 03:03:10.330]
Great.

[03:03:10.790 --> 03:03:11.470]
Happy birthday.

[03:03:11.690 --> 03:03:11.970]
Thanks.

[03:03:12.450 --> 03:03:14.510]
You had the last call from Shadon Nuga of that.

[03:03:17.290 --> 03:03:17.810]
I have a lot of fun with this.

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:17.810]

[03:03:17.810 --> 03:03:20.190]
That wasn't Bill Cosby who had anything to do with it.

[03:03:20.190 --> 03:03:20.990]
Was it Michael Jackson?

[03:03:21.670 --> 03:03:22.070]
No, it wasn't.

[03:03:42.090 --> 03:03:44.490]
No, that's Jackson.

[03:03:44.490 --> 03:03:46.350]
print in all formats everywhere.

[03:03:46.690 --> 03:03:47.190]
I'll be damned.

[03:03:47.570 --> 03:03:48.810]
But there was a great movie.

[03:03:48.990 --> 03:03:51.310]
That was a great movie that all children should be seeing.

[03:03:51.910 --> 03:03:52.270]
Definitely.

[03:03:52.550 --> 03:03:55.050]
And there are elisted copies out there, of course.

[03:03:55.670 --> 03:03:57.330]
Not that I would know anybody that has one.

[03:03:58.170 --> 03:03:59.290]
But they're out there.

[03:03:59.430 --> 03:04:00.970]
And if they can be had.

[03:04:01.410 --> 03:04:01.650]
OK.

[03:04:02.010 --> 03:04:02.410]
All right.

[03:04:02.810 --> 03:04:03.970]
I'm going to call a moosey man.

[03:04:04.050 --> 03:04:04.730]
I bet he's got one.

[03:04:06.410 --> 03:04:08.050]
No people closer to you than that.

[03:04:08.190 --> 03:04:08.430]
OK.

[03:04:08.630 --> 03:04:08.810]
Thanks.

[03:04:08.910 --> 03:04:09.090]
All right.

[03:04:09.270 --> 03:04:09.370]
See.

[03:04:10.510 --> 03:04:12.130]
It's 10 to 1 at 5.60.

[03:04:12.230 --> 03:04:13.350]
In fact, we might have to double play.

[03:04:13.350 --> 03:04:14.750]
Because they got to play Mickey calls Eisner.

[03:04:14.950 --> 03:04:17.250]
And of course, that too.

[03:04:17.950 --> 03:04:19.470]
So better get with it.

[03:04:19.750 --> 03:04:20.330]
10 to 1.

[03:04:20.370 --> 03:04:21.470]
We got the mad dog about a clock.

[03:04:21.470 --> 03:04:22.890]
And you hear all these people calling it.

[03:04:23.070 --> 03:04:24.990]
Like that because they're all whipped up into a frenzy.

[03:04:25.070 --> 03:04:26.690]
And also they're pissed off and fired up.

[03:04:26.750 --> 03:04:27.750]
We used to be blessed.

[03:04:27.850 --> 03:04:29.230]
And now we're cursed, man.

[03:04:29.410 --> 03:04:30.310]
We are cursed.

[03:04:30.950 --> 03:04:32.550]
Because the Lord looked down and he said, well,

[03:04:32.550 --> 03:04:33.370]
these people are OK.

[03:04:33.430 --> 03:04:34.470]
And I realized it's election day.

[03:04:34.530 --> 03:04:35.730]
And they're going to screw that up big time.

[03:04:35.970 --> 03:04:36.850]
So screw them.

[03:04:37.030 --> 03:04:37.430]
Screw them.

[03:04:37.530 --> 03:04:38.930]
They're crappy goddamn football teams.

[03:04:39.030 --> 03:04:39.610]
How do you like that?

[03:04:40.350 --> 03:04:41.110]
That's what he said.

[03:04:42.810 --> 03:04:45.590]
I think he was really pissed because the Hercune didn't cover the spread Saturday.

[03:04:45.710 --> 03:04:47.530]
That's what the Lord was really bent out of shape about.

[03:04:47.850 --> 03:04:49.030]
A little big bet on that thing.

[03:04:49.950 --> 03:04:51.710]
Let me tell you about our frenzy drive concepts.

[03:04:51.870 --> 03:04:53.170]
You know, the holidays are coming pretty soon.

[03:04:53.170 --> 03:04:53.710]
It'll be Thanksgiving.

[03:04:54.270 --> 03:04:56.670]
And it'll be Christmas and Chanooka and New Year's all of these things.

[03:04:57.010 --> 03:04:59.690]
And most folks out there are going to have a lot of guests coming in through that house.

[03:05:00.290 --> 03:05:03.430]
Now who in the right mind want the carpets looking and smelling really funky at a time

[03:05:03.430 --> 03:05:03.770]
like that?

[03:05:04.130 --> 03:05:07.010]
Holidays are an important time, at least to put on a good show for everybody.

[03:05:07.190 --> 03:05:08.970]
Also make them think you're not to slide that you really are.

[03:05:09.250 --> 03:05:10.590]
So call our frenzy drive concepts.

[03:05:10.590 --> 03:05:12.430]
They will do a spectacular job for you.

[03:05:12.530 --> 03:05:15.270]
I've been talking about them and using them for over 20 years in my home.

[03:05:15.490 --> 03:05:17.250]
There's nobody in the world that's a job for you like them.

[03:05:17.470 --> 03:05:22.430]
You can check them out on the web if you like it at brand new website, www.dryconcepts.com.

[03:05:22.590 --> 03:05:26.130]
And not only do they do a stupidest job of driving your carpeting and making them look

[03:05:26.130 --> 03:05:29.770]
and smell and feel just like brand new, but they also do a spectacular job of cleaning

[03:05:29.770 --> 03:05:30.890]
your furniture and drapery.

[03:05:31.210 --> 03:05:34.730]
Spot dyeing, fiber protection, carpet repairs, and planar rental rug service.

[03:05:35.030 --> 03:05:38.350]
The authorization and if you have a flood, complete water damage restoration too.

[03:05:38.350 --> 03:05:42.390]
Seriously, everybody I know who's got any brains at all uses drapery concepts and rave

[03:05:42.390 --> 03:05:44.790]
about the super job they do and they'll do the same for you.

[03:05:44.930 --> 03:05:48.030]
And don't forget, no ripoffs, no scams, no bad surprises when they finish.

[03:05:48.330 --> 03:05:51.510]
They give you a written guaranteed price before they start to enter a great job.

[03:05:51.930 --> 03:05:55.730]
Call them from anywhere until free now, 1-800-248-5071.

[03:05:56.270 --> 03:06:01.170]
1-800-248-5071, clean today, entertain tonight with drapery concept.

[03:06:01.430 --> 03:06:03.110]
My life and love.

[03:06:03.590 --> 03:06:05.510]
This is 440560.

[03:06:06.050 --> 03:06:07.310]
You win, you win.

[03:06:09.370 --> 03:06:13.330]
You never know who will call Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[03:06:13.470 --> 03:06:14.070]
How are you, David?

[03:06:14.250 --> 03:06:15.510]
Voice of the Miami Dog.

[03:06:15.870 --> 03:06:18.070]
I'm going to tell you what, and you don't need to shame this plug.

[03:06:18.250 --> 03:06:19.570]
But I listen to you guys every day.

[03:06:19.710 --> 03:06:20.790]
You guys are doing a hell of a job.

[03:06:20.890 --> 03:06:22.350]
It's fun to listen to and O'Brien.

[03:06:22.630 --> 03:06:24.230]
I mean, the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[03:06:24.370 --> 03:06:24.690]
What?

[03:06:25.070 --> 03:06:26.010]
Did I hear that right?

[03:06:26.350 --> 03:06:26.970]
Back up the page.

[03:06:27.190 --> 03:06:29.490]
If I listen to you guys every day, you guys are doing a hell of a job.

[03:06:29.590 --> 03:06:31.070]
It's fun to listen to and O'Brien.

[03:06:31.330 --> 03:06:32.930]
I mean, the whole thing you guys are doing there is great.

[03:06:32.930 --> 03:06:38.070]
Wow, even Mohawar David listens to Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.

[03:06:38.310 --> 03:06:38.810]
Exactly.

[03:06:39.370 --> 03:06:39.930]
Eisner?

[03:06:40.430 --> 03:06:41.310]
Mr. Mouse?

[03:06:41.990 --> 03:06:45.110]
What the hell are you doing to me?

[03:06:45.850 --> 03:06:47.090]
What do you mean, sir?

[03:06:47.310 --> 03:06:48.770]
Why am I reading in the paper?

[03:06:48.930 --> 03:06:51.310]
You're going to put a Disney theme park in Brooklyn?

[03:06:51.790 --> 03:06:53.530]
Well, sir, we're just scouting locations.

[03:06:54.110 --> 03:06:56.010]
Jesus, I'm scouting CEOs.

[03:06:56.370 --> 03:06:57.590]
You are killing me.

[03:06:57.890 --> 03:07:01.890]
But Silicon has done what New York City Times Square pays second street.

[03:07:01.890 --> 03:07:03.470]
Hey, no, I'm...

[03:07:03.470 --> 03:07:04.090]
Remus!

[03:07:05.510 --> 03:07:05.950]
Remus!

[03:07:06.430 --> 03:07:08.690]
Turn off the vacuum, Quentin Remus.

[03:07:09.030 --> 03:07:10.550]
Get that blue bird out of here.

[03:07:10.710 --> 03:07:11.430]
Okay, boss.

[03:07:12.350 --> 03:07:13.390]
Eisner, look, sir.

[03:07:13.510 --> 03:07:14.970]
Look what we do with Midtown Manhattan.

[03:07:15.390 --> 03:07:16.890]
42nd Street is incredible.

[03:07:17.070 --> 03:07:17.950]
I don't want...

[03:07:17.950 --> 03:07:19.330]
Publicly, I supported that.

[03:07:19.410 --> 03:07:20.770]
But you took all the porn away.

[03:07:20.890 --> 03:07:21.490]
You're killing me.

[03:07:21.650 --> 03:07:23.350]
I'm going through a gabboscom like kids.

[03:07:23.770 --> 03:07:26.550]
We're just scouting areas calm, dad.

[03:07:26.690 --> 03:07:27.710]
Listen to me, Buck Munch.

[03:07:27.850 --> 03:07:29.090]
Don't tell me to calm down.

[03:07:29.090 --> 03:07:30.830]
We got lucky with Lee Lowell and Stitch.

[03:07:31.090 --> 03:07:31.990]
$128 million.

[03:07:32.590 --> 03:07:34.950]
Now, you're trying to ruin the whole network.

[03:07:35.250 --> 03:07:37.110]
What kind of programming are you running?

[03:07:37.450 --> 03:07:38.790]
I'm in my way.

[03:07:38.810 --> 03:07:39.690]
Hang on a minute.

[03:07:40.010 --> 03:07:41.090]
The big, huge...

[03:07:41.610 --> 03:07:42.250]
Remus!

[03:07:42.730 --> 03:07:43.070]
Yes, boss.

[03:07:43.070 --> 03:07:46.190]
Get that blue bird crap all over your shoulder.

[03:07:46.810 --> 03:07:47.210]
It...

[03:07:47.210 --> 03:07:47.510]
It...

[03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:49.310]
When you're self-opera, heaven's sake.

[03:07:50.290 --> 03:07:52.510]
And turn off the vacuum cleaner.

[03:07:52.750 --> 03:07:53.570]
Okay, boss.

[03:07:54.010 --> 03:07:55.070]
Good God.

[03:07:55.530 --> 03:07:57.350]
Sir, the network is fine.

[03:07:57.350 --> 03:07:59.270]
Why couldn't you come up with American Idol?

[03:07:59.450 --> 03:08:02.170]
Good God. You're still running James Bobmovie.

[03:08:02.370 --> 03:08:03.950]
They're 60 years old.

[03:08:04.190 --> 03:08:07.130]
Why don't you just put Steamboat really on and be done with it?

[03:08:07.490 --> 03:08:09.650]
Please finally make a couple of damn dollars.

[03:08:10.330 --> 03:08:12.350]
Well, the movie division's fine.

[03:08:12.670 --> 03:08:17.210]
You mentioned we were in Stitch and now we have the new M Night Shumel on movie coming out later this summer.

[03:08:17.310 --> 03:08:18.190]
Oh, I know. Signs.

[03:08:18.250 --> 03:08:20.950]
What the hell does that mean? Stop sign, yield sign.

[03:08:21.490 --> 03:08:24.130]
You're going to start swinging some of these titles past me.

[03:08:24.130 --> 03:08:24.970]
Please.

[03:08:25.450 --> 03:08:27.570]
Oh, what's going on?

[03:08:27.810 --> 03:08:28.330]
Remus!

[03:08:29.890 --> 03:08:30.410]
Remus!

[03:08:31.110 --> 03:08:31.110]

[03:08:31.110 --> 03:08:32.050]
Here you go!

[03:08:32.730 --> 03:08:35.190]
I know you can't hear me, Remus.

[03:08:35.610 --> 03:08:37.410]
You're still running on the market planet!

[03:08:38.110 --> 03:08:40.150]
You're the last one, the run of the engine!

[03:08:40.150 --> 03:08:41.430]
Get on here, Remus!

[03:08:41.590 --> 03:08:42.850]
And take that blue bird, please!

[03:08:43.410 --> 03:08:44.850]
All right.

[03:08:45.310 --> 03:08:45.690]
Picer!

[03:08:46.190 --> 03:08:46.970]
Yes, sir.

[03:08:47.010 --> 03:08:49.550]
I'd be very careful the next time I started my car.

[03:08:49.730 --> 03:08:50.190]
Why were you?

[03:08:50.410 --> 03:08:51.530]
What do you mean, sir?

[03:08:51.530 --> 03:08:52.410]
I'm not done with you.

[03:08:52.610 --> 03:08:52.750]
What?

[03:08:52.750 --> 03:08:53.650]
Bad done.

[03:08:53.950 --> 03:08:54.430]
What, sir?

[03:08:54.510 --> 03:08:56.170]
I'll put Hannah Storm in your job.

[03:08:56.490 --> 03:08:56.770]
What, sir?

[03:08:56.890 --> 03:08:58.010]
You're terrible!

[03:08:58.290 --> 03:08:58.670]
I'm sorry.

[03:08:58.970 --> 03:09:00.430]
Maybe I'll put Remus in there.

[03:09:00.790 --> 03:09:03.050]
I do like to be president of Disney Remus.

[03:09:03.490 --> 03:09:04.470]
Oh, man.

[03:09:04.850 --> 03:09:06.190]
What a wonderful day!

[03:09:06.650 --> 03:09:07.890]
Get on here, you nothing.

[03:09:14.930 --> 03:09:16.310]

Oh, man.

[03:09:29.230 --> 03:09:31.810]
Looking fascist and a perfect little Nazi.

[03:09:32.410 --> 03:09:35.610]
I want to build their coffee through your soil panties.

[03:09:35.830 --> 03:09:38.190]
The starting news, looking swung and sweet.

[03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:41.790]
Laughing your lips like ancultures rose big.

You ever think about doing cuttles?

[03:09:59.010 --> 03:10:00.390]
Do you bet you're a cunt?

[03:10:01.490 --> 03:10:02.770]
You want to touch it?

[03:10:03.090 --> 03:10:03.630]
Three ways.

[03:10:04.030 --> 03:10:04.190]
Sir?

[03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:06.090]
You're being like a man.

[03:10:07.110 --> 03:10:08.430]
Don't you think I'm mad at you?

[03:10:09.490 --> 03:10:12.930]
Don't you think you're a thief, but between your punks?

[03:10:13.210 --> 03:10:15.890]
I'll set it taste like bubble gum.

[03:10:16.470 --> 03:10:19.390]
See you next time you need a story done.

[03:10:19.690 --> 03:10:23.150]
Since it takes a dimmero to make you come.

All right, you get really, uh, oh my god,

[03:10:37.570 --> 03:10:38.670]
too much helium from these balloons,

[03:10:38.890 --> 03:10:40.470]
and all of a sudden your voice just goes fly.

[03:10:40.470 --> 03:10:41.250]
That's all we have.

[03:10:41.470 --> 03:10:42.290]
It sounds like Geldy.

[03:10:43.190 --> 03:10:44.610]
I don't forget Mullen Geldy tomorrow.

[03:10:45.010 --> 03:10:47.290]
I'm going to pass out from all this helium here.

[03:10:47.890 --> 03:10:49.590]
Thanks to whoever this was.

[03:10:49.770 --> 03:10:50.110]
How about?

[03:10:50.390 --> 03:10:51.230]
Well, I'm Sherry.

[03:10:51.370 --> 03:10:52.290]
Thanks in sunrise.

[03:10:52.530 --> 03:10:54.730]
They said I'm much of birthday balloons and a nice car.

[03:10:55.050 --> 03:10:57.610]
And I loved the hospital of George E. Scott by Pat and Chaffsky.

[03:10:57.610 --> 03:10:59.670]
I also love Boworth and Warren, baby, so I'm both.

[03:11:00.570 --> 03:11:01.910]
Was that talking about Boworth and Amsterdam?

[03:11:02.190 --> 03:11:03.390]
I've seen that over there, I think.

[03:11:05.250 --> 03:11:06.310]
Hello, I'm Las Gelpa.

[03:11:06.710 --> 03:11:08.030]
I'm Las Dildgulp.

[03:11:08.170 --> 03:11:10.990]
Speaking of a big gulp, I mentioned a man dog took a couple of big gulp

[03:11:10.990 --> 03:11:13.010]
after that game last night, a couple of big pops.

[03:11:13.010 --> 03:11:14.050]
It was disgusting.

[03:11:14.050 --> 03:11:15.190]
It was disgraceful.

[03:11:15.210 --> 03:11:15.970]
I loved it.

[03:11:16.030 --> 03:11:18.110]
A lot of people are going to be pissed off and fired up about it.

[03:11:18.110 --> 03:11:18.990]
Bye, bye, bye.

[03:11:19.390 --> 03:11:22.530]
Can you watch us show on Clive's YouTube and QA ad?

[03:11:22.710 --> 03:11:23.570]
My name is for learning.

[03:11:23.910 --> 03:11:27.790]
You never know who will call Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio.
