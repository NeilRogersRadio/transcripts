[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740]
Hey, it's Howard.

[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.000]
Howard David.

[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.220]
Well, I'm here to tell you, it's about a woman who squeezed out the largest smelly

[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.720]
subpoody burps in America.

[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.520]
Ronnie Wilson, one of the three brothers who founded the Gap Band was the first to encounter

[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.760]
Doris, a groupie who worked her way backstage.

[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.440]
The band's manager, Slatty Gold.

[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.080]
I will never forget that night.

[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.720]
One by one they come out of the dressing room, gagging from the wind this chick is laying

[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.100]
down.

[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.880]
Ronnie says to me, she was damn good, but do not even attempt 69.

[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.740]
Long fed up with the bad rap men get for their flakulists.

[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.840]
The Gap Band recorded, you dropped a bomb on me, hoping to send a message of equality.

[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.060]
That men and women are pretty much alike.

[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.640]
Both their digestive systems processed certain foods into glass of odor's methane.

[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.960]
People wanted a love song, I guess, so that's what they thought it was.

[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.440]
The world just wasn't ready for a song about noxious butt fumbles.

[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.000]
And what of Doris?

[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.860]
Tonight, inside of behind, confronts her with being the inspiration for the Gap Band's

[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.580]
hit song.

[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.660]
Oh, those guys, it's all just sour grapes.

[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.000]
I show them an awful good time.

[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.140]
And you know how men will do anything to make us women look bad.

[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.300]
Oh my god.

[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.360]
I think my nose is bleeding.

[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.260]
It's a big juicy, stopping wet look at your business tonight and inside of behind.

[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.580]
2018 at 560 WQM Happy Thursday too.

[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.260]
So somebody says, CKLW in Detroit, I got that on my list, but thank you very much.

[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.220]
And Eric had some good ones to end the list there, which we did.

[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.760]
So here's the list we got so far.

[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.520]
The greatest AM top 40 station ever was, long list, WQAM.

[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.140]
All right.

[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.760]
WFUN, WCFL, WLS, WABC, WKNR, oh sorry.

[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.080]
WIPG, WAPE, the big ape.

[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.320]
Now, Jacksonville is not one of the great markets in the country, but that was a major, major

[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.920]
radio station.

[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.920]
Greaseman was a WAPE, the big ape.

[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.500]
WMGM, which I found Peter trip on here, the curly head of the kid in the third row that

[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.760]
got caught up in a payola scandal.

[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.640]
I found him on here too.

[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.780]
Everything is on there.

[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.220]
KHA, that I just say that.

[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.640]
CKLW, CHUM Toronto, which had to go back to oldies recently because they tried to knock

[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.880]
it off the fan with another sports station in Toronto and guess what?

[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.820]
Drop another big bomb speaking of that.

[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260]
So they're playing oldies again on AM on CHUM in Toronto.

[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.680]
WSYZ, WBZ, WMEX, WKBW.

[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.420]
We got some Joey on here too, baby.

[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.060]
Joey Reynolds, you know him?

[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.240]
He's an asshole.

[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.380]
WHK, KFI, WWWE, W3, WEE.

[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.340]
Didn't the Reneery work there once upon a time?

[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.640]
That's WWE, I think so.

[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.440]
And WWE, WOW, WOW in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.860]
All those were the days, the 50,000 Watt clear to, and of course CKLW wasn't the same though.

[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.580]
Because if you live all just about all your life down here, you never heard any of those

[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.200]
stations, except the ones in Miami.

[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.080]
Right?

[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.740]
Right.

[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.700]
But if you live like anywhere up north in the northeaster in the Midwest or even like in

[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.480]
the, not the far west, but the Midwest up to like the Rocky Mountain States, you could

[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.640]
hear at nighttime all of these stations just booming in.

[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.540]
That's back in the days when people used to speak English on AM radio.

[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.220]
I know, I know that comes as a tremendous shock to your system.

[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.580]
I'll give you a young punk stuff there.

[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.760]
Yes Virginia, there was a Vannu to your radio, believe it or not.

[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.280]
So if anybody's got any other ones, WQIM.

[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.180]
See I was going to take some right on the phone as opposed to making facts to men.

[00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.680]
When you think that's a good idea?

[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.440]
How about WBF and Rochester, home of the Busy B's?

[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600]
I don't think I get too many votes.

[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.220]
Home of the Busy B's, WQIM.

[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.020]
Yes sir.

[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.500]
You hope that the new nominations.

[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.160]
Yes?

[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.700]
K-A-A-Y is out of Little Rock.

[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.200]
Yeah I remember that.

[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.020]
Well that's used to boom all over the Midwest.

[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.560]
Right.

[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.360]
That was like, okay thanks.

[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.820]
What?

[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.620]
K-A-A-Y, was that the right call it or so in Little Rock?

[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.800]
Well that's right, what the hell do you know?

[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.300]
WQIM, that's all I know.

[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.040]
So you're going to vote for a QIM just because that's the only top 40 station you ever heard.

[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.360]
But I used to listen to you and I actually used to listen to it.

[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.940]
Well I'm not going to tell anybody who I'm going to vote for.

[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.960]
Because it would be like a tip off and be a bad idea.

[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.260]
And I want to tilt the thing on.

[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.800]
May 16, 1969.

[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.520]
I'll put your pardon.

[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.500]
That's when I started listening to you.

[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.380]
Is this thing going to fire?

[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.380]

[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.740]
She doesn't know.

[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.800]
I wrote as if she was not you.

[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.420]
Keep hanging on to WK and R.

[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.580]
K-N-R-B-R-T.

[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.020]
She lots of jingles on here too.

[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.720]
For Blind Light.

[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.960]
WK-N-R-T.

[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.500]
K-N-R-T.

[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.920]
K-N-R-T.

[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.180]
K-N-R-T.

[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.240]
K-N-R-T.

[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.340]
K-N-R-T.

[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.200]
K-N-R-T.

[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.820]
K-N-R-B-R-T.

[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.720]
K-N-R-B-R-T.

[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.860]
K-N-R-T.

[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.880]
K-N-R-T.

[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.160]
K-N-R-T.

[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.000]

[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.020]
See once they stopped with jingles on radio stations, that was the end of fun radio.

[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.200]
I don't mean WFU-N.

[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.460]
I mean just it was the end of fun in music radio.

[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.640]
WQ-I-M.

[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.980]
Hello.

[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.560]
Yes sir.

[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.000]
Neil.

[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.580]
Yes sir.

[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.900]
How about K-N-P-C and Los Angeles?

[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.340]
Okay. See I never lived out in the West Coast so you're going to have to help me with that.

[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.080]
The only one I remember is K-H-J.

[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.760]
You got it.

[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.440]
You know they got to keep track.

[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.420]
What is it?

[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.300]
You guys used to do the on-glass and that's the DJ.

[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.160]
Dan Roller.

[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.320]
No.

[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.600]
No the announcer from what was his name?

[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.520]
With the deep voice.

[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.480]
Oh it'll come to me thanks.

[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.520]
What the hell was the guy who used to be the announcer on radio?

[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.000]
Gary Owens.

[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.720]
I don't know what call it.

[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.560]
Gary Owens K-N-P-C.

[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.540]
Have you got K-A-W-A-K-A-Y?

[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.960]
Yes.

[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.420]
A?

[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.940]
Yes.

[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.940]
K-N-P-C.

[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.360]
See the West Coast ones we need some help on that.

[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.760]
It's going to be a long list but that's okay because this is sensational if you ask me but I don't like it screw you you know.

[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.840]
That's my opinion.

[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.060]
Oh now why is it doing this thing?

[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.600]
Why is this thing acting up again?

[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.420]
Everything was going so swimmingly well on here you know.

[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.040]
All I did was just oh it's got to connect again after you stop it.

[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.120]
Oh oh oh oh.

[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.340]
See like I said computers and the internet are a wonderful thing but uh boy oh boy all you need is for...

[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.300]
Let me see if this is going to fire off again otherwise I'll just take some more calls.

[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.740]
I'll have to do it during the break.

[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.800]
Is that depressing or what?

[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.580]
I'm probably just farewell I'm talking.

[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:46.860]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.720]
Hi I was wondering if I could talk to Neil.

[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.440]
Speaking.

[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.880]
I'm fine.

[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.620]
Speaking.

[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.940]
This is Neil.

[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.820]
Sounds like me.

[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.660]
What about SRF?

[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.180]
It's the late great-born brother.

[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.140]
Right WSRF a station that nobody could pick up on here or I'll radio right.

[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.200]
What was that about?

[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.820]
It was...

[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.060]
I was in an intern there one time without what I meant.

[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.520]
Ron he was in there smoking a joint with the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen.

[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.900]
Okay thanks pal.

[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.600]
WSRF don't put that on there.

[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.740]
No don't put that on there.

[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.260]
No it wasn't the greatest EM top 40 station.

[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.380]
First of all nobody could hear the goddamn thing.

[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.140]
You know who wants own WSRF?

[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.600]
Jack Mark.

[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.100]
That's true that very good.

[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.460]
What an asshole here.

[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.020]
Jack Mark.

[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.740]
He's an asshole.

[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.500]
This big parking space over there in Hollywood.

[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.720]
Scroyo Jack okay.

[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.340]
Where's that thing we got with this over there in the corner?

[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:35.460]

[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.360]
It's hiding behind the bed.

[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.360]
The Janet Reno doll.

[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.380]
Jack Mark in his parking spot.

[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.840]
Wow what are you parking in my spot?

[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.340]
Like a big shot over there at Paxton.

[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.380]
You Jack.

[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.080]
Anyway WSRF used to be owned by Van Patrick.

[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.020]
He used to be the great football broadcaster for the Detroit Lions many years ago.

[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.480]
One of the great play by play broadcasters of all time by the way Van Patrick.

[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.760]
Best known for saying Philadelphia.

[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.880]
That's what he used to call it the Eagles Philadelphia.

[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.560]
He had a strange way of saying that.

[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.000]
And also Joe Schmidt the great linebacker.

[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.100]
Even when he was sitting on a bench Van would have him make in the tackle on just about every defensive play.

[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.880]
Because I don't know why they just like them I guess.

[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.900]
I give goosebumps when I hear those jingles.

[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.180]
I really didn't end the quality on those.

[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:18.920]
It's really amazing.

[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.780]
Because those are from 1967 WKNR and Detroit.

[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.220]
I don't think the Detroit stations do all that well.

[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.540]
Like because they weren't some of the best in the country back in the heyday of Motown and Detroit music.

[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.520]
But because we just don't have that many Midwestern people here.

[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.720]
Oh, it's surprising we got a couple like you know some L.A. stuff.

[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.060]
Why would anybody come from L.A. to hear?

[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.720]
You got me.

[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.800]
W.A.M.

[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.380]
Hey how about WJBK and Detroit with Tom Clay?

[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.460]
Excellent choice.

[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.720]
And what about Robin Seymour?

[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.100]
Hey Robin Seymour.

[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.120]
Robin with the Robin.

[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:48.740]
You got it.

[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:49.420]
Okay.

[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:49.980]
Thanks.

[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.800]
Thank you.

[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.480]
You're welcome.

[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.800]
WJBK Detroit.

[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.260]
See this is like a nice break from you know this one's got the bombs and we're going to wave eight.

[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.880]
I mean I got a whole pile of crap here.

[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.980]
But once I was able to download this stuff last night and listen to it I thought holy crap.

[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.840]
This would make for like a nice break you know what I'm saying?

[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.440]
Because we're just I'll be honest with you.

[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.580]
This is not the show where we put on a big act for you.

[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.480]
I'll be very honest.

[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.100]
We're just biting our time till Monday.

[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.180]
You know I have a theory that that's Joe's handwriting.

[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.060]
Joe Castella.

[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:15.420]
Really?

[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.520]
Hey thanks a lot.

[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.980]
You always liked that little grease ball.

[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.840]
Joe Castella.

[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:28.900]
And by the way if anybody wants to the website it's www.realradio.com.

[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:40.740]
And everybody who and it's got a great thing on it where you can like do your own search for radio stations or for dish jockeys or anybody who ever owned a radio's owner.

[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.360]
It's great.

[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.460]
WQ I am.

[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.340]
New.

[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.060]
Yes sir.

[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:45.860]
How you doing sir?

[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:46.580]
Sensational.

[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.540]
It's funny I called George last week and I was talking about the tape I had of RKT with the burden everything.

[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:53.820]
Right.

[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.760]
And about six months ago eight months ago I stumbled on that R-E-E-L radio.

[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.180]
I got the idea from you when you were playing Jingles.

[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.000]
When you were getting them from I was surfing the net and stumbled on to it.

[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:05.600]
It was great.

[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.040]
Right.

[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.260]
And I was going to say WAP.

[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.600]
I live in Orlando and I listened to them when the grease man was on.

[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:17.460]
I had some old tapes with them and some guy said WFORF I even have a sound bite of that.

[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.240]
Some guy called Bill Donovan and he was the FORF.

[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.160]
How about WGBS when they were top 40?

[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.920]
That's before I came here I think.

[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.460]
I don't have to ask Ken Maldon about that.

[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.020]
And you ever heard a gilly bow bank?

[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:31.600]
Sure.

[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.080]
He's on there on some Louisville Kentucky station.

[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.300]
Oh and I'm glad you mentioned Louisville Kentucky WAKY.

[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.140]
Bill Bailey I don't want to forget to play in.

[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:40.940]
He's on there.

[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.320]
Yeah I know that.

[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.540]
I just listened to him a little while ago.

[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.940]
I'm glad you reminded me to play it.

[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:50.560]
It had some bit on there with Gary Burbank when he's getting ready to leave the show and some guy comes in.

[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.680]
He's all ticked off and he says he's going to shoot him.

[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.080]
He's going to fake shooting.

[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.500]
He's guy.

[00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.460]
Oh man somebody's going to take the spot at two o'clock Monday and he tells us other guy.

[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.440]
You're going to fill in.

[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.300]
He goes I'm not going to make it man.

[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.420]
But that must have been WAKY wasn't it?

[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.960]
Forgot what it was.

[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.780]
But it's there just type in Gary Burbank or Louisville Kentucky and you'll find it.

[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:12.440]
Okay thanks.

[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:12.920]
Thank you.

[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:13.340]
See ya.

[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.920]
Don't let me forget Bill Bailey WAKY.

[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.120]
You know the interesting thing about him is he was he was they called him the morning mayor of Louisville.

[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.620]
I mean he really owned the market at like 99 shares.

[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160]
And he went to WLS in Chicago to do mornings.

[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.600]
I guess it was after Lou Jack left and just laid the biggest egg.

[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:29.380]
I don't know what it was.

[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.440]
They didn't his humor didn't go over there or whatever and he went back to Louisville.

[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.000]
He wasn't there six months I don't think.

[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.720]
It's kind of like Alex Bennett over here.

[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.040]
Yeah kind of like Alex Bennett only with talent.

[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.240]
927 at 560 W and without the life studio audience.

[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.800]
Hey does this sound like you overworked?

[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.080]
Yes.

[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:48.800]
Underpaid.

[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.220]
Yes.

[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.320]
Stuck in a crappy dead end job.

[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:52.800]
Uh huh.

[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.340]
Well here's the deal.

[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.260]
Do yourself a big favor.

[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.460]
Get out of that dead end and get on a real luck career.

[00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.340]

This is 4205 City.

You ain't no way.

[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:01.780]

[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.280]
We cow errands coming.

[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.180]
This Halloween scare and intimidate your neighbors with the end of Nicole Halloween costume.

[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:18.980]
It's a life like 6 feet tall and 22 feet around and it's guaranteed to get you candy.

[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.700]
You wait all our candy.

[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.940]
What else do you want?

[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.200]
For small cheese pizzas.

[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.420]
Oh no, she's getting sick on the lawn.

[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.540]
You said it through half and I didn't.

[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.980]
The end in Nicole Halloween costume.

[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.580]
Enormous life size press on ass, sold separately.

[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.420]
Now let's fake fire out.

[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.620]
And this is the biggest one.

[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.620]
So don't be the same.

[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:41.540]
Really big.

[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.000]
This drop is really grumpy.

[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.160]
I didn't throw up.

[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.880]
Okay, you people in the audience have to check what's happening in the world because we're two everybody in the buildings.

[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.080]
I'll whipped up about this website and I don't blame them.

[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:58.800]
Because I just saw Noel Bush was sentenced and they hit her there in court and they were like taking a handcuffs off and putting them back on and taking them off again and doing that stuff.

[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.080]
So maybe you'll find a story about Noel sentencing and things like that.

[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.280]
Uh, it's a great station in the RWMCA.

[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.000]
Which actually beat WABC for a long time in your WMCA.

[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.480]
The only problem being grown up in Rochester.

[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.760]
We couldn't hear WMCA because they were like, I think, 5,000 months.

[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.760]
And the other 50,000-month powerhouses they used to like boom in.

[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.660]
Now somebody faxes me this.

[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.760]
Police found Monday night here at this Thursday, but there's a reason I'm going to use this.

[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.840]
We're questioning a 38 year old former Marine with apparent similarities to the sniper being sought in the Washington area shootings that had left 8 dead and 2 wounded.

[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.920]
Police said it was driving a white astro van.

[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.300]
The same type of color of vehicle.

[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.740]
Seen that the most recent sniper shooting in Northern Virginia.

[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.940]
And the search for the man's department police found an A4-15 rifle.

[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.460]
An AR-15 rifle.

[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.800]
Shell casings ammunition and a book about snipers.

[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.720]
News reports said.

[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.380]
Now why do they keep saying on here?

[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.180]
There's no suspects.

[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.300]
You know, every case we got, oh, we're questioning a lot of people.

[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.120]
Boy, you have no suspects.

[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.720]
In addition, MSNBC also reported the man works for a large radio company.

[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:03.180]
Is believed to have a territory that includes suburban Washington and the police are seeking additional federal warrants in the case.

[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.760]
He works for a large radio company.

[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.600]
How do you like that?

[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.880]
Oh, I sure hope they don't work for a cheap channel.

[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.880]
Or something like that.

[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.740]
Wouldn't that be embarrassing?

[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.160]
Yeah, would.

[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.380]
Oh, see, I'm sure that the beesleaves that we don't want.

[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.520]
Well, we do have that station in Philadelphia.

[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.680]
I think we still have those stations up there.

[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.280]
We dump them.

[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.220]
Don't know.

[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:19.920]
We don't know.

[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.240]
We don't know anything about this company.

[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:21.820]
And you know something?

[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:22.880]
That's the way we like it.

[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.880]
So we had a WMCA in New York to the list.

[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.580]
Oh, I got to do the Bill Bailey thing.

[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.200]
And I have no idea how long it's going to take for these things to...

[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:30.760]
Oh, geez.

[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.220]
Oh.

[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.040]
Oh, like I said.

[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.820]
Now I can't stop the damn thing.

[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.700]
Is there a reason for that?

[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.620]
It says stop your player.

[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:46.740]
And...

[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:48.920]
Stop it.

[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:49.860]
Stop it.

[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:50.820]
Stop.

[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.160]
Eumaniac.

[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:52.640]
Stop.

[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.980]
And then go back.

[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.140]
Did you think I'd have any problem with this?

[00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:58.940]
Well, let me click it again.

[00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.700]
OK, it says play.

[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.760]
It's lighting.

[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:01.340]
It's blinking.

[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.460]
Bill Bailey, WAKY-Luaville.

[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:04.880]
Historical.

[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.520]
And it might just pop up sometime between our midnight, maybe not.

[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.320]
You listening?

[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:08.820]
You're waiting?

[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:15.680]
The first thing I heard this morning from my radio was your introduction to your 20 before the hour sports report, Mr. Yein.

[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.400]
And that's your reason why I was a little bit late this morning.

[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.780]
By the way, I wanted to mention this morning.

[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.680]
I plan to mention this two or three times.

[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.860]
That Thursday night, we're going to have a series of softball games out here at St. Helen's Field.

[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.300]
And lively, shyly.

[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:35.900]
Now, the first game at 7 o'clock will be between Alan Hamilton and his deputy sheriffs.

[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.300]
And Thursday night, St. Helen's Field in shyly, the first game was at 7 o'clock.

[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.640]
And it's for the Monty-Axman Memorial Fund.

[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.920]
Are you feeling well this morning, Mr. Yein?

[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:46.660]
No, pretty fair.

[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.920]
The old hay fevers going wild.

[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:49.580]
Or something.

[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.980]
Well, I'm sure it is.

[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:51.820]
A fever man.

[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:57.060]
All this humidity we've had to pass for a few weeks isn't up to cause a problem such as that Mr. Yein.

[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.580]
Let's go to work, sir.

[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.080]
Don't put up your love.

[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.300]
Go for it.

[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.740]
We have a good Joe Frank in the Rebel.

[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.600]
Go for it, love.

[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.700]
But out on me, baby.

[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.160]
If you do, I think that may be.

[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:09.940]
I came home.

[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.880]
Oh, Bill, for heaven's sake.

[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.360]
Well, I'm just trying to wake up.

[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.880]
It's going to take me a little time this morning because I arose late this morning.

[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.760]
You think I didn't have to rush to get to work this morning?

[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.380]
Oh, would you believe?

[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.820]
99 and 3 quarter miles per hour.

[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.560]
29 minutes before 7 at WAKY631.

[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.060]
All mornings.

[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.080]
It's fun and easy to call her powe.

[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.540]
Shop your call her top supermort.

[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.280]
Today.

[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.860]
I haven't had the time.

[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.480]
I simply didn't have the time to prepare myself for work this morning.

[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:49.620]
So this morning I'm not quite as neat and fresh and cute and cutly as I normally am.

[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.900]
Yeah, but you're just as offensive as you normally are.

[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.120]
I don't think I asked for an opinion today.

[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.360]
WAKY Louisville, the Lonegum, naturally.

[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:04.780]
WAKY.

[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.220]
You'll be forced to the 11.

[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.520]
It's 6.36.

[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.480]
24 minutes.

[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.920]
You notice how most of these guys sounded like even Ricky Tiki in coherent.

[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.100]
I don't want to say stolen because that would be a bad term to use.

[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.980]
And of course we know what's his name that never used drugs back during the 60s and 70s.

[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.820]
What though his name would have white hair?

[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.360]
Tommy.

[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.440]
Tommy Kramer, right?

[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.820]
Oh yeah, no relation to Billy J or Brad Kramer, but nevertheless.

[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.460]
And thanks for Thomas that Tommy.

[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.740]
You sure could have fooled us.

[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.000]
Thank you for faxing me by the way.

[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.120]
Judge gives Noel Bush 10-day sentence.

[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.740]
Maybe that's why she had the handcuffs on.

[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.140]
Noel Bush was sentenced to 10 days in the Orange County jail this morning by circuit judge,

[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:47.760]
regional whitehead, the 25-year-old daughter of Governor Jab Bush, told the judge I sincerely apologize.

[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.220]
Although whitehead did not discuss the reason for her jailing in open court,

[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:57.560]
it was clear that the sanctions came as a result of a September 9 incident in which a dime-sized rock of crack cocaine was found in her shoe,

[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.900]
while undergoing treatment of the Center for Drug Free Living police reported.

[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.700]
Bush was accompanied by her aunt, Dorothy Cook of Bethesda, Maryland, as well as her two attorneys.

[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.100]
She was led away in handcuffs to be booked into the jail.

[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.260]
See, I actually noticed that out of the corner of my eye.

[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.820]
Before whitehead issue, a deserted Bush said,

[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.000]
Judge Whitehead, I sincerely apologize for what happened.

[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.380]
And I promised to do well at the Center for Drug Free Living.

[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.140]
And the judge said, yeah, sure.

[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.040]
Anyway.

[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.780]
Something like that.

[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.420]
Poor Bush, man. Poor Jab.

[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.480]
You can't just smell it.

[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.620]
You can just smell the aroma of defeat.

[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.480]
Anyway, I started to mention several minutes ago before I got distracted.

[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.020]
And it is, I will say, there's like a little lag.

[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.340]
That should be our worst problem.

[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.120]
When you click, when you click play on these things,

[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.040]
because they kind of fade in,

[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.320]
but tough crap.

[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.360]
So we won't be as tight as usual.

[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.980]
But I started to say that we're just kind of like fighting our time until Monday.

[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:48.800]
And why is that?

[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.940]
Because the guy named Summer Book comes out on Monday.

[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.580]
Oh, brother.

[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:57.700]
And I'm going to, this building is as tight as a witch's ass.

[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.920]
You can smell the aroma in the hallway.

[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.040]
Don't think either of that or most peace.

[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.720]
He's wearing that powdery one today.

[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.700]
Remember that first time when I met him?

[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.540]
And I said he's got enough talcum powder on his smells like cashmere bouquet.

[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.260]
Remember that that must have been in the hair piece.

[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.400]
And the two pay.

[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.400]
Well, I don't know what you're laughing about.

[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.080]
For the bottom of the building, father is the way those powdered wigs.

[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.140]
You're the one that told me that he's got a different one for different days

[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.680]
that he's got a whole collection of.

[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:23.380]
I never knew then.

[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:24.820]
It's true.

[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.860]
So I think I think he had a good point there in the beginning.

[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.180]
You try to back away from that and put it all on my ass.

[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.020]
You're the one that owe a back lift.

[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:48.720]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:48.720]

[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:48.720]

[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:48.720]

[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:48.720]

[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:48.720]

[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.080]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:49.920]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.220]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.000]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.420]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.480]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.300]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.000]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.940]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:21.960]

[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:21.960]

[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:21.960]

[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:21.960]

[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:21.960]

[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:21.960]

[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:21.960]

[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:21.960]

[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.080]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.360]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.700]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.840]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:30.980]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.280]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:51.380]

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:51.380]

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:51.380]

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:51.380]

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:51.380]

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:51.380]

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:51.380]

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:51.380]

[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.140]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.280]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.780]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:58.860]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.960]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.420]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:19.420]

[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:19.420]

[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:19.420]

[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:19.420]

[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:19.420]

[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:19.520]
And then I went back to the back of the building.

[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:54.180]

[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:54.180]

[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:54.180]

[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:54.180]

[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:54.180]

[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:54.180]

[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:54.180]

[00:26:54.180 --> 00:27:00.560]
Your coachy toe nails makes them world of wretch and you

[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:08.380]
Your nappy lager look as like it's evil for all

[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:13.920]
If you'll be what you to be, that talk is true

[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:20.500]
One day while you be sniffing fangames you may realize

[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:26.900]
That they're dreaming you just like your esterone

[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:33.440]
That when your head will move from side to side from the leader

[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:39.180]
It's your push and rummage, they be cracked from ash

[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.400]
I'm 49 on the great Thursday here at 560wQIM

[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.760]
I'm adding to the list, Eric, just in case you're paying attention

[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.260]
KQV in Pittsburgh, KDKA in Pittsburgh and WRKO in Boston

[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.840]
How could we left that out? And somebody fangs me by the way

[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.940]
68 WRKO in Boston, great top 40 states in the 70s early 80s

[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.440]
To lay me at a talk till Jerry Williams took over

[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.980]
All starline of Dale Dorman, the amazing Johnny Dark

[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.980]
Johnny Dark's an asshole

[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.440]
And that's our Johnny Dark, you know there have been many rickshaws

[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.740]
Many Johnny Dark's, but this was our Johnny Dark

[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.760]
Johnny Dark's an asshole

[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.420]
Good mid days at RKO, Harry Nelson

[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.580]
The exciting Mike Adams, who I never heard of, it says yes

[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.220]
Even my mom won a turkey during Thanksgiving from Johnny Dark

[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.100]
Johnny Dark's an asshole

[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.080]
Thanks Lenny, thanks for reminding us about the great WRKO

[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.000]
It's gonna be a long list here today, but what else wrong with that?

[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.680]
I'll see the only problem like I said with this thing is I clicked a thing

[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.960]
And what's this fax about mad? Do we care about mad?

[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.760]
No, they fax all the time like the rabbi and these people

[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.920]
Yeah, right now 50 degrees and the cloudy in New York

[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.540]
World News Next

[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:47.340]
On WNB, on WAVC, this is Bob Caperns

[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:54.500]
A terrible judge in Memphis threw out arguments from Tennessee prison officials who claimed that Playboy magazine would increase homosexuality among the inmates

[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.900]
This is ABC contemporary radio

[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.800]
Now the most music on WAVC, New York

[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.860]
WAVC's dead in gold, go go go

[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.560]
All right, that was John Meyer

[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.580]
You're always can count on John for all the hot news

[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.040]
Two minutes of filipide gasoline mileage

[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:18.980]
And a story about homosexuality and prison as it relates to the consumption of Playboy

[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:30.740]
So it's all good to know that something, you know, when something really fantastic and necessary to know when

[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.540]
And the lightning is happening, my here's there

[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.960]
Go go go

[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.740]
Or somewhere else or whatever

[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.540]
I didn't notice there were at least one brown and one black shoe today

[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.840]
Got up in the wrong side of the bed

[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.940]
Oh, it's your own bed too, I think

[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.020]
Yeah, what's this?

[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.720]
Your face

[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.100]
Your face

[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.640]
Speaking of faces, here's the face himself

[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.600]
Okay, it's not up to Dan, Dandy Dan Ingram

[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:11.040]
Somebody faxes me and says, you know listen to the Kamox and St. Louis used to boom in the farts from a Fartsmith Ark and so I homo the St. Louis Blue

[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.900]
Is that's correct, Dan Kelly on Kamox, Harry Curry with a Cardinals

[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:19.740]
The only thing I inject, Buck, Western piece, the only thing I'm wondering though, did Kamox play top 40 ever?

[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:23.540]
I don't know about that

[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:28.600]
I thought that Kamox was always like kind of like a Newsy and um, sportsy and...

[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.580]
Huh? I don't know

[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:34.240]
Somebody laughed to call and let us know because I did listen to Kamox a lot but always at night and always with sports

[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:39.500]
They had the Harry Curry doing St. Louis University Billiken basketball games

[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:45.380]
Which at that time when Harry came by Murphy's bleachers in Chicago and I reminded him about that and gave me a blank look like

[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.380]
He said

[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.780]
So anyway, we got the WRKO added to list

[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.640]
This list will eventually get up on here as soon as we hear this said we're finished

[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.200]
Okay, and another four or five days

[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.560]
How about you QAM?

[00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.280]
QAM, hello

[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.200]
Hello

[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.000]
Yes sir, yes, I am

[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.080]
I'll give you a brief story if you let me finish it

[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.940]
When we were younger here in Miami we used to cruise around on Miami Beach

[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:16.420]
Had those old radios and rotate the dial and you could tune into the station that you could take up late at night

[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.800]
And a couple years later I get shipped out to Vietnam and we used to fly these night missions

[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:29.960]
High over the jungle, a tetra tetra with a similar technology that we're using today for this sniper problem

[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:34.460]
The point I want to make is that one station we could always get over there

[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:39.720]
You know because of the skip wave on the radio signal we could always get WLS in Chicago

[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.040]
Right

[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:46.360]
And no matter what we were in the nighttime when we were flying and doing this stuff it was pretty interesting

[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.480]
So I thought I'd mention that

[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.020]
Okay, thanks

[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:49.720]
That's my story

[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.820]
Thank you great station

[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.000]
Okay, let me just say this there's a thing on this website

[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.220]
Or it says return to the repository and you can like do a search and audio search

[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.060]
Let's see WLS

[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:03.100]
Right

[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.240]
Right

[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.440]
So I just type in WLS

[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.960]
And there's a whole list

[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.820]
John Records Landicker

[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.800]
Oh here's Bill Bailey at WLS in Chicago

[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.420]
Now you probably don't want to hear any more Bill Bailey do you?

[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.960]
No, I would love to hear more Bill Bailey

[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.180]
Yeah, I know you wouldn't

[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:16.940]
He was great though

[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:17.460]
He was very funny

[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.120]
Tom and Paul Collins WQXY Atlanta

[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.580]
Dick Wilson WLCY Tampa St. Pete

[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.920]
What the hell is this after it with what I'm looking for?

[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:25.780]
Huh?

[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.960]
Well, it all gives a crap about Atlanta radio

[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.140]
Well, probably somebody does

[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.640]
You think I clicked on the wrong thing there?

[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:33.660]
I don't know

[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.860]
Well, we'll do it through in a break

[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.360]
Hey, don't forget Joanne Jokostel on Mike's Heart Limited this afternoon

[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:42.180]
4 to 6 of the publics at 1305 University Drive & Cruel Springs

[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.220]
Stop by to win prizes

[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:45.000]
The usual crap that we give away at QM

[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.820]
Because we have a low budget where a bunch of cheap passes

[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.920]
And registered to win a pair of tickets to the homestead Miami Speedway in November

[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.980]
It kind of breaks your heart when you hear Ricky Tiki doing all those talk-ups

[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.500]
On his older QM tapes

[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.560]
And you realize that we actually gave away like big prizes back then

[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.500]
Like $5.60 stuff like that

[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.280]
So I guess this evil one they had other owners

[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.200]
This was always a cheap skate place

[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.840]
At least on the AM side

[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.460]
On the FM side we pay fortunes to try to force people to listen to that crap

[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.720]
WLCY Tampa St. Pete

[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.860]
Now, does that kind of like make you want to listen to like a few seconds of it?

[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.280]
A couple of seconds?

[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:18.580]
No?

[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:19.200]
A second?

[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.100]
Well, it's Dick Wilson WLCY 1966

[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:26.480]
Which I do remember WLCY and that was the big rocker over there

[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:27.980]
Wasn't it?

[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.940]
Low to Night 72, High Weapons, Day 90

[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:32.700]
Can I just start?

[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.780]
Only Windsor Southwest West early 8 miles per hour

Oh, how happy you have made me, but the shades of blue and WLCY

[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.140]
ABC TV's where they actually live

[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:11.800]
It's coming to town, but still I can aim for the target to most

[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.600]
All in person

[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:19.540]
Hi, this is Jim Allen inviting you to see one of the greatest lineup of stars ever to appear in one show in the state of Florida

[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.360]
All in person, this

[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.440]
Like I said, Florida Radio pretty boring, you know what I'm saying?

[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.840]
9.56 at 5.60 WQAM

[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:29.380]
WQAM

[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.440]
We're sports radio 5.60

[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:32.940]
QAM

[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.680]
Bush, frick, dumbass

[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:44.420]
With some crack in her shoe and some sand eggs in her purse

[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:49.740]
She's the rankscan governor's daughter who resembles after birth

[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:52.620]
She knows that that is the cup

[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.600]
So if she breaks the law, well that's tough

[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.820]
It ain't any dirt goddamn business

[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.240]
So just keep your big mouth shut

[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.440]
When it comes to family values

[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.440]
A prime example for all of you

[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.540]
There ain't nothing like the morals of the good bushman

[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.580]
Please go with some crack in her shoe

[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.460]
No other foot powder will do

[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:23.440]
It makes your feet warm and tingling that's all day

[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.120]
Come on, you bitch, bitch

[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.360]
That's right, yes, I'll be the best

[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.640]
I'll be the best, bitch, bitch

[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:38.000]
I don't want it 5.60 WQAM

[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.740]
I'm right, these things are like, you know, there you go

[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.940]
It might just have come up there, you think?

[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.040]
Count 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, here we go

[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.260]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:54.220]
You're hearing, playing, you're hearing things

[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.840]
On air, W, L, S

[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:11.380]
W, L, S, W, L, S, W, L, S, and Chicago

[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:17.840]
And Chicago, and Chicago

[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:26.840]
Wonderful, wonderful, W, W, L, L, L

[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.820]
W, L, S, and Chicago

[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.680]
Wonderful, wonderful, W, L, S, and Chicago

[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.760]
Ah, it gives me goosebumps, baby

[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.740]
Here's what I said, don't forget, and I won't put him on there

[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.680]
Here's two more for Eric

[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.300]
This will be a list of about 6,000 stations, you know?

[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.560]
Isn't it amazing that there are so many to choose from?

[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.800]
These were all great radio stations, as opposed to like

[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.360]
The swillets on your radio, now most of the crap, the...

[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.980]
Oh, W-O-R and W-N-B-C, near, are a cock-a-way forget that

[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:08.180]
And Boka Brian will be impressed because you know who used to work once upon a time at W-O-R, Arlene Francis

[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:09.820]
His favorite

[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:13.360]
So Johnny Dark is working at KISS, are you smitten me?

[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.720]
No, I had to verify it, and it's true

[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.360]
Johnny Dark is doing afternoons 2-7 on KISS, he's down on all these weekends

[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.240]
A weekend, so I see 2-7 weekends, and he's kissing it, that's what I'm hearing

[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:22.840]
And Philin?

[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.140]
He's wearing his Tiffin

[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.920]
F-E-E-N-W-L-S

[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.320]
Oh, the alcohol probably

[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.540]
Love those Dr. Pellas, B-E-N-W-S

[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:44.540]
Shake God go weather, the big T-E-N-E-N-E-N-W-L-S

[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.720]
Bob, you can get dizzy from playing too many of them

[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.760]
And we got to C-K-L-W ones, we got Bob Green

[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.160]
Both Bob Green, they used to work here at Q-A, and then when he went to Keener and Detroit

[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:52.940]
Were you worried about that?

[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.300]
That he was able to PD at Keener and Detroit?

[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.080]
Well, there you go

[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:59.200]
We got so many Bob Green's, we got Bob Green, that little weasel, used to be an IOD, of course

[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.860]
My good close personal friend who's still working on cooking up deals behind the scenes with Cheryl

[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.100]
They're cooking up something

[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.540]
And then we have the Bob Green that used to be Anita Bryant's husband

[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:12.080]
Back in those Anita Bryant gay bashing, witch hunting days in the late 70s

[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:17.160]
And then of course we found out that her former husband Bob Green had boyfriends up in Orlando

[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:17.660]
Oh, right

[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.740]
Yeah, we found that out, a little bit too late, I guess we found it out, not that it made a difference

[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.640]
And then of course there was the real Bob Green who used to work right here at this radio station

[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.060]
Right in this chair, wasn't it in this?

[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:26.320]
No

[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.700]
In fact, where on how was Q-A-M?

[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.340]
Is this any original studios?

[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.060]
Yeah, this certainly wasn't in that trailer

[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.200]
No

[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:38.400]
Nobody knew right in mind what it worked in, but in fact Ricky wouldn't even brought his cap into that place

[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.360]
That sounds like an investigative project

[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:45.820]
Yeah, let's find out where the O-W-Q-M used to be back when it was a real radio station back in the Glory Days man

[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:53.300]
Back when it was real Glory to be at this radio station as opposed to having a bunch of perverts drilling glories in the T-room, which is what we have now

[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.980]
Where's all my jingles by all its under Q-A-M, isn't it?

[00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.660]
All the jingles we got the real ones?

[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.660]
We could play some of those although quite frankly

[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:07.140]
By six-o, WQ-A-M

[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:13.140]
We in south, we in south, by heavy

[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.620]
Number one under the sun

[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:23.640]
Now here's one that says all inspiring Pam's WLS news intro

[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.800]
And I think I listened to this already and quite frankly

[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.160]
See some of the real radio groupies like the guys that put this website together

[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.320]
They get a little bit over-impressed with like news intros and things like that

[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.620]
I think you're gonna be disappointed, but at any rate, it's coming!

[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.360]
Trust me!

[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.080]
Ah, you're right

[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.740]
Sir, you were absolutely correct

[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:52.600]
Thank you

[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.240]
It was pretty inspiring

[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.180]
It's not like that update that we got here at Q-A-M the one that goes

[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.560]
Like that for about two and a half minutes?

[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.080]
That was awe inspiring, wouldn't you think?

[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.540]
The McAllister Hotel in Luxurious Miami Beach

[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.060]
Was that where Q-A-M used to be?

[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.560]
Over on the beach

[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.100]
Well I'll be goddamned

[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:16.600]
And in fact we probably have some old WC-KR jingles to it here

[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.360]
Now what the hell is this?

[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.680]
WLS VUGY check!

[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.300]
I wish to tell these things would fire right off, you know, like real quick

[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.820]
So I didn't have to sit here like vamp and fart around

[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.360]
You know, just press the guy damn thingy

[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:44.060]
And of course, well I have to hear some of Bruce Bradley and WBZ

[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.040]
Who hated the music, by the way, should point that out

[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.100]
Anybody remember Bruce Bradley?

[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:48.880]
No, too bad

[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.860]
He also worked in Philly, I think, at WYBG

[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.640]
WYBG is on list, isn't it?

[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.920]
We're probably leaving some Philly stations out because I just never lived there

[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.800]
Who do we know from Philadelphia, anybody?

[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:03.340]
I mean WYBG was huge, huge, but it seems to me that

[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.760]
I don't know what station Allen Fried was on back during the pay-all of scandals in those days

[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.880]
But we'll find out

[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:09.840]
W-Q-A-M

[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:11.780]
Hey, is this George?

[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:12.300]
Yes

[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:16.220]
Hey George, I feel like you know being a native here, I'm not in the car anymore

[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:20.280]
The OQ-A-M was on 41st Street, also got free road in Miami Beach

[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:20.720]
Wow

[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.620]
And that's something

[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:22.480]
How long go was that?

[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.260]
Through the 60s and a good part of the 70s

[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:29.020]
And that I remember, I moved away from Miami Beach by the early 80s

[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.340]
So I don't know if it was still there, but that's where it used to be

[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.060]
Okay, thanks

[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:32.480]
You're welcome

[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:32.920]
See ya

[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.420]
Let's see, here's the facts from Billow says, who the hell does Mr. David did it and to think he is

[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.380]
I thought Rick Rodney was the world's most obnoxious sipping rip

[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:46.140]
But this old geezer with two first names might just be swiping the trophy right out of Rick's greasy ferret jerking paw

[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:51.380]
I'll play by playing out, who's supposed to be a relatively unbiased party, simply calling the game as it progresses

[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.140]
Leaving the extraneous comments to his in this case very capable color commentator

[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:56.660]
Alright

[00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:00.900]
For some of it seems to think he's God's gift to radio, it's way beyond the boundaries of good taste

[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:06.860]
Much less professionalism to attempt to force his opinion about the playing status of a football player upon those officiating the game

[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:12.720]
He's gonna show Miami how to do a talk show, he's gonna tell sister Mary Madditch, who's exactly when to talk and when to shut up

[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:17.240]
He's gonna fire George just because he's stupid and now he's gonna tell the NFL how to run their enterprise

[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.920]
Let me tell you, he better know his place in this station mister because he sure doesn't

[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.100]
How do you like that?

[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:27.000]
Signed Bill, who I guess is kind of like amateur bridge tender

[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.340]
Thank you Bill, and says no mo bits, lots of mo bits

[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:34.000]
In fact, how is that CD doing? Looks like we're moving like hotcakes now, isn't it?

[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.100]
They ought to have any some audio

[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:38.780]
Oh, man

[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.960]
This is a little bit almost too much like work today, you know what?

[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:45.700]
As opposed to just reading them dumb bedtime stories, but a lot more fun

[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.460]
Now let's see, did I play that? What I guess we'll do a next thing WBZ in Boston?

[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.780]
By the way, W-I-N-S

[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.900]
W-I-N-S 10-10 West New York

[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.900]
W-I-N-S, thank you, get that on air, Kazirika

[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.320]
I'm calling him during the breaks with all of these things to make sure but he's been doing it

[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.800]
You're interrupting him a lot today, you know, and he might lose an answer too, but I doubt it

[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:07.120]
Remember I've talked about eating and talking at the same time, he puts me to shame as what I'm hearing

[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:12.840]
I'm telling you, he can eat like two or three breakfasts while he's communicating with you about the pole

[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.140]
That's the rumor from his lovely Japanese wife, that's what he told me

[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.060]
Is he got it up there yet or not? Cause he didn't know what to have to

[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.840]
He's holding onto it, but you can't get it to the world

[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.220]
Hold it back cause the phones are ringing off the hook on this thing

[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:29.560]
We're doing screenless by the way, because George is on strike, he won't answer your stupid calls

[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.500]
Auto, you don't have that thing up? No, no, we don't, so forget about that

[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.200]
We'll get to be the perth, huh? What would be the pole?

[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.380]
There wouldn't be any point, plus I got to take a leak real bad

[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:39.220]
Real bad

[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:44.180]
Nine minutes after 10 to 560 WQA, hey if maybe somebody took a leak on your mattress

[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:49.020]
That's a good lead in, huh? No, seriously, there are things that happen, you know, sometimes things seep out

[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.940]
We don't want to go into what it all might be

[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:55.500]
But anyway, after a certain amount of time, actresses get kind of funky, you know what I mean?

[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.540]
They're like, that's it, let's get rid of that thing

[00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.280]
It smells bad and got only knows what's been going on and that thing

[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.080]
So let's get a great new mattress from our good friends, it's an allumatrus

Whatever it might be when it's convenient for you when you're going to be home and they'll be there

[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.660]

[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:19.760]
This is sports radio bikes to QAM

[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:27.880]
Remember this golden gasser

[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.600]
Wonderful WQAM

[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.720]
He's back again

[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:48.780]
Back to the pumpkin patch as the world's greatest star awaits the return of the world's greatest pumpkin

[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:53.060]
Happy Pace, it's the great pumpkin James Brown

[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.040]
Papa's in the pumpkin patch

[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.400]
Come on, give me that

[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.840]
It's TV's pumpkin-y perennial flavor

[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.080]
Wilbur, great pumpkin, finally visit James this year

[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:21.100]
Join soul brother number one and his friends for the funkiest Halloween ever

[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:24.200]
Have you know the great pumpkins on the finest patch?

[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:24.640]
Yes

[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.660]
Because James be wearing the psychotemic hot pants this year

[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:31.960]
I hope you'll like James because I don't want to miss out on the sickle fans

[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:36.020]
I miss you don't need no candy when the gods bought a soul make your face so sweet

[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:36.700]
Give it up

[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.320]
It's the great pumpkin James Brown

[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.440]
Good sweet, I feel good

[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:45.660]
Head 16 to 560 WQAM here's another old guy how you doing suds?

[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.940]
Oh I'm doing just great never better

[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:51.340]
Yeah, hold on

[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:54.040]
I don't even believe his hornet just flew in the kitchen

[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:54.800]
Go to hell

[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:55.600]
Is this an old man?

[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.940]
Yeah, I think it means something

[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.960]
No seriously, what are you guys doing anything?

[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.840]
Well I'm making a placemat out of a loose cat hair

[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:09.100]
I think Rick is hurting sheep and he's got a loom and making his own clothes

[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:11.340]
Oh yeah, he finally thought his calling it sounds like him

[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:12.220]
Yeah

[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:17.700]
But no, nothing I'm really getting sick and tired of it and I'm bored and I'm getting pissed off

[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:22.400]
Yeah, maybe I need to get a new dish gets to find some new channels

[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.500]
That might do it

[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.180]
Yes, spice up your luck just a little bit

[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.660]
It's just me and turn classic movies all day long

[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:31.940]
There you go, what more could you want?

[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.380]
I got a couple of stations for him

[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:33.760]
Yes sir

[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:35.260]
Oh, West might help you out

[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.260]
KOL and KJR both in Seattle

[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.140]
Oh, damn things radios

[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:40.960]
I'll see I never live there

[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.020]
KJR and Eric better be putting these down

[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:46.040]
Okay, because this is a man who knows his radio and once worked it a long time ago

[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.980]
KJR and KOL

[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.660]
Yeah, excellent

[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.200]
If you get the WFIL in Philadelphia

[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.500]
Oh yeah, WFIL very good

[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.260]
And WMEX Boston

[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.180]
That's on there

[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:57.960]
Oh, is it?

[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:02.680]
In fact, there's some on, I'll remember to play later, there's an Arne Ginsburg clip on this website

[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:03.840]
You ever check this website out?

[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:08.900]
You know, and I'm sorry George, but you know, it's not a personal here with George

[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:14.240]
But you know, I passed this site on to him at least three years ago to get him

[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:14.740]
Oh, I forgot

[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.800]
Yeah, but you see if you would have done it three years ago, but I already done this show

[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.120]
And I wouldn't have anything to do next if we had time story

[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:20.920]
So it's good that

[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.680]
There's a, there's a cup, by the way, there's an old WFUL newscast on there

[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.600]
That is just a killer

[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.900]
With bells and sirens and nods

[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.840]
She's just ridiculous, but it was funnier now

[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:38.700]
And there's also another bit on that website called Just Nine

[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.020]
You ever heard that?

[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:40.540]
No

[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:50.780]
It's kind of like a parody of radio, tightening up everything to the point where, finally, the only thing anybody says is Nine

[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:52.560]
Really?

[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:53.060]
Yeah

[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.200]
Like Robert Greenberg could be on it

[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:55.540]
Yeah

[00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:00.760]
So you just tighten nine in that search engine there and it'll pop right off the screen

[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.460]
Okay, great

[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.500]
So I'll listen, I got a run now

[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:06.340]
Okay, you don't want to miss, well, Ren and Snippy

[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:08.080]
Okay

[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.560]
Take your say adipam

[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.420]
Yes, I will

[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:11.360]
And Rick, if you must

[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.580]
Okay, see you

[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.140]
So I'll see you

[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:17.640]
So it's Coleman from Rick and Sons, Voix-Tubey, what a shame, my nice guy, as well, Rick was, yeah

[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:23.400]
Now Rick's okay in his own bizarre, we see every time we get into this, we get started again and you go into denial

[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.320]
Because you're a real pussy and you don't want to like

[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.300]
I don't deny anything

[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.840]
I don't have any problem with Rick

[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.780]
Rick is just kind of a yey who, okay, he keeps trying to kill his kids

[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:33.240]
And you know, now they're doing a fine job on that

[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.040]
And you're gonna assess with a cheerleading wife now

[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.760]
I'm trying to figure out, was the second wife the cheerleading wife?

[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:37.980]
Yes

[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:42.640]
So that was very similar to the Paxon experience, the former stripper turned born again Christian

[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:47.760]
That gave Buddy Bud religion, I got him to be, at least on the surface of religious, not even when he said

[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.060]
Ah, it's all a vantissue, man, he told me that

[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:56.920]
And then we got Rick, who used to be a real pervert and then turned into a real goody-two shoes because of his cheerleading born again Christian wife, right?

[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:57.980]
Something like that

[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.880]
Even when his kids turned out to be real hell-raises as he would recount on the wrong tree

[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.340]
My theory is, she just awakened stuff that was already inside

[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.880]
By the way, we'll tell Pete Boulder a special high-for-your-suds

[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.840]
Hey Pete, two-for-you for the price of one

[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:13.420]
Here's what it says, check out the www.aircheckfactory.com

[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.760]
They've got old DJ tapes, even Roby Young

[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.420]
Oh, I can't wait to hear Roby Young, huh?

[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.080]
I bet you're here

[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:20.520]
I bet you're here

[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:23.640]
I bet you're on this, oh jeez

[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.380]
Just when my tennis elbow was getting better, we're getting two with the ice

[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.400]
And I just threw it over

[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.080]
We have to go

[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:32.740]
We have to go

[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:36.560]
Now there's a Ricky Tiki one on here and there's a Roby one

[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.420]
And boy, we could hear the Aka Pella, Roby Young

[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.400]
It would make give me goosebumps in my groin

[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:44.120]
We have to go another winner

[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:49.400]
On bicycle, so you can stay in

[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.900]
It gets the right

[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.320]
Anyway, we got the whole history of WQM

[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.420]
Where did we get this off the QM website?

[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.440]
www.560.com

[00:50:59.440 --> 00:50:59.780]
Wow

[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:01.420]
Not our website, somebody else's

[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:03.340]
560.com?

[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:03.960]
Yes

[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:07.860]
And no, it's not the current QM website obviously because it's much too good for that

[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.400]
But it's got the whole history of WQM

[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:14.480]
Which I think I might get into a little bit of this sunshine wireless, purchased the station in the 85

[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.320]
But what would they have bought you, great robbers, huh? That was the two live Jews

[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.300]
Yeah, those guys may

[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.720]
They made these people look like fast pay is what those people were

[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:28.480]
And then sold it to Beasley Broadcasting in 1960, current owner is...

[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.080]
Must be

[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:30.600]
Roby Young

[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.440]
Roby Young

[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:34.760]
He's still dead by the way

[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.540]
He's still dead by the woman with a man in mind

[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.280]
Roby Young

[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:43.020]
On WQM

[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.060]
1021 at 560, it's celebrate radio day

[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:49.220]
I'm not really sure why, but why not?

[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.880]
I'm enjoying it

[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.700]
Everybody around here is running around, suds, calls in

[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:58.140]
This is more fun than we've had since you got your bonus check six months ago

[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:00.560]
Or 10 months, whenever the hell it was

[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:02.860]
Now we're all caught up, right?

[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:03.880]
Yes

[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:08.080]
And then of course Monday we'll find out if any of us are going to be getting the next bonus check

[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.140]
That's the pressure is going to be building like I said

[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:11.560]
You can smell it here

[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:12.740]
Where's Bruce Bradley?

[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.920]
Is he coming up? WBZ? That was a great station man

[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.720]
I live in Boston

[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:19.580]
I live in 1905, approximately, roughly in the city

[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:23.540]
It's passed by, I have 60 degrees outside in Boston too, cut a lot too

[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:26.380]
He will ask the English going up Bruce Bradley, Tuesday show

[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:26.900]
Elba

[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.800]
It's number 10 tonight

[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.020]
I like it if you want to send my...

[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.260]
Sounds like Bob Lincoln, right?

[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:38.680]
Do you want to dig a lot of digests?

[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.900]
The King still lives out with friends, they are number two BZs for exactly their 60

[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:47.920]
Oh, it's called Viva Las Vegas, it's number 10, cut a lot of the bleach boys

[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.220]
Next, after we break your eyes

[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:53.160]
More than half the people in Massachusetts have Blue Cross Blue Shield

[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:57.900]
Paul or Wright, Blue Cross Blue Shield or this station today

[00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.800]
I think I'll play a pretty song

[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.080]
He painted the Sweden in every one of these songs I've played

[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:07.280]
I was in the swing as the big boys number four

[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:17.780]
That word baby, it's trash to be going daddy

[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.340]
As the beat's boys, I double to BZ, I was spectacular

[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.760]
64 would never, never, ever, ever, ever

[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:26.680]
An unsuccessful song, the top three songs coming along after Brian Neal and Billy J. Kramer

[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.280]
His number three was little chill on

[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:30.660]
See, Billy J. Kramer didn't I just mention that before?

[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.480]
Of course you wanted to know why, I already listened to that earlier

[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.940]
But nevertheless, there's a little psychic connection there, ain't there?

[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:36.140]
No

[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:40.800]
Let's see, WDQM was also downtown Miami, around 1954 to 1956

[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:42.920]
Givertech, more Masomenas

[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:44.800]
Did you mention WGTO or WocN?

[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:46.680]
WocN?

[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:48.580]
What's that?

[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:49.980]
I don't know

[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:50.340]
Ocean?

[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.120]
WGT?

[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:52.460]
Oh!

[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:55.140]
I think that's it was in Dayton, Ohio, wasn't it WGTO?

[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:56.340]
Dayton, Ohio?

[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.080]
Yeah, like I've been to Dayton?

[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:02.000]
No, no, I'm not saying that, but if you ever lived in the Midwest, which I did, Dayton, Ohio

[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.500]
It was one of those with a good signal, you hear it at night, WGT

[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:06.020]
Oh!

[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:10.340]
Oh, then of course there was that song by the Hondaels, did they do a little GTO?

[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:11.860]
I think so

[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.960]
It's opposed to the stand-ills who did dirty water

[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.620]
See, this is all bad now, see?

[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.880]
And then I'm going to go back to that one-hit wonder stuff again

[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.700]
And I won't have time for no bad, bad, bad written stories

[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:22.180]
Oh, right

[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:25.280]
That's bad, but that'll give me a chance to get my pile built up here, you know?

[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.140]
There's nothing like having your pile built enough

[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.960]
That's what Moe told me this morning

[00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:35.120]
Sean and Hollywood is a chronic factor, but a pretty good one usually, pretty dependable, reliable guy

[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:39.840]
He says, last time I was in Pittsburgh, I tuned into KDK A and heard Rush Limbaugh pipe tin

[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:43.520]
You see, that's the sad part of all these big 50,000-watt powerhouse stations

[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.960]
Now they're all running the same syndicated crap

[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.820]
If I knew where to get explosives, I'd suicide bomb their transmitter screaming

[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.280]
Long live Ed and Wendy King

[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:56.020]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, Ed and Wendy King

[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:57.820]
Now let's see, who else used to be on KDK

[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.040]
That was a guy on at night

[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:02.220]
I know, he was out overnight

[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:05.080]
When I worked in Sarasota, I used to hook up with his guy during his show

[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:07.300]
He used to put me on here from Sarasota and Les

[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.660]
Burried, Jack Wheeler

[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:14.760]
And everybody I've talked to in the business said, Jack Wheeler was like a BWINNLIMM like that, like a WACO, which I'm sure he's dead

[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:21.720]
Fat ass Limbaugh Sean says, on the birthplace of Radio The Gale, here it is, Reed's Cordic, Jack Bogut

[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.940]
Art Palants, John Signe, oh John Signe

[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:29.540]
Who I believe once upon a time worked in Lansing, Michigan, a WILS, I think

[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:32.340]
Perry Marshall, Roy Foxx, and the great Uncle Ed Seanesys

[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:36.420]
Matter of fact, John Mahor was doing the news in WABC and at Danny Grum thing I played before

[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:41.620]
John Mahor used to do the news of Keener and Detroit and before that at WKFR, Keener and Battle Crick

[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:46.500]
And I think he once drank water out of a Crick, that's what Tommy Thompson told me

[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:53.380]
PS in the 70s, it says the best top 40s station was 13Q, WKTQ featuring Don Cox

[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:55.900]
Are you ready for that Don Cox?

[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:56.540]
Party

[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:03.720]
Especially for those who want to hear the night's delight, the night's delight went out in Georgia seven times an hour

[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:08.780]
Speaking of KQV, the word around the campfire is that former hipster Jim Quinn has become so right

[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:12.040]
WINNLIMM makes Limbaugh look like Pete Signe, what a drag it's getting old

[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.180]
Okay, thank you Sean

[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:19.120]
Remember that song, what a drag it is getting old, Pedalsong, WGTO

[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:22.580]
I don't know, I don't think I'm going to put that on, they're all though I'm sure it was probably pretty good

[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:24.780]
What was it, Stone Song?

[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.060]
What was?

[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:31.940]
That's right, there was this make, old wrinkled up dead British, some of them dead British

[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:34.340]
Yeah, you're right

[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:41.360]
Anyway, what the hell am I doing here? I was going to queue up that Arnie Ginsburg thing but I'll get to it after the break

[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:43.760]
So much pressure, so little time, you know what?

[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:47.740]
Like I said, this is almost too much like work, I'm sure that there's some people out there

[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:52.560]
Do we rather hear the bedtime stories, we want to hear your bash bush again, don't worry

[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:56.000]
We got plenty of time, we got two days less three weeks until the election

[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.600]
Guess who my mother's going to vote for? Well of course that would be in any case anyway

[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.660]
She went to vote in the primary and September 10th and was going to vote for Bill McBride

[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:06.740]
And over there in Hollywood she went 830 in the morning and they vote over there in the clubhouse

[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:11.240]
And the Condo Compulse and the people were even older than she is

[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:12.840]
Which I guess she's a teenager at Billing

[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.180]
The people are like in their 110s

[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:19.260]
We weren't ready yet, we haven't got these, they haven't figured a machine that she just she went home forgot about it

[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.320]
She wasn't going all the way back

[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:24.720]
Taking that two minute walk all the way over to the clubhouse again to bother voting

[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:28.540]
And it's a damn good thing, he didn't lose by one vote, I'll tell you that right now

[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:31.600]
Or you had had some real, real bad crap on your conscience

[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:34.080]
If poor Bill McBride would have lost by one vote

[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:41.860]

See there you go

[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:04.900]
City police are looking for a lone bandit who hit a well as far go truck for $55,000

[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:08.140]
80% of which was cash and down tell Miami

[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:11.100]
The Coast Guard reports 44 Cuban refugees

Our feared dead is the result of a both being swamped by hurricane ideas in the Florida Scrapes

[01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:05.250]
Was a great station for about an hour. Now actually that I don't think they did all that great they went up against WLS

[01:11:06.210 --> 01:11:09.570]
And I just don't think they ever did that great as a top 40 station. What the hell do I know?

[01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:15.090]
5 6 7 0 5 16 out before we take anymore calls or anything more put in WDRC and Hartford on there because

[01:11:15.090 --> 01:11:17.550]
Duff came in and just jumped around and went nuts

[01:11:18.010 --> 01:11:21.370]
No, he didn't but he said he said TIC was 50,000 watts

[01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:25.550]
But they weren't like the big dominant top 40 station Hartford it was WDRC

[01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:29.130]
I said well leave here. I'll leave that up to you. What do I know from Hartford, you know?

[01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:37.270]
Who cares about freaking Hartford with all due respect, you know, I mean he lived there in that area or somewhere he lived somewhere

[01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:42.070]
Rick and Suss were on in Hartford were they really they were on in Seattle?

[01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:45.310]
Yes, they were what station were they on in Hartford?

[01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:49.590]
Well, why didn't you ask Suss when he called me before he could totally what states they were on in Hartford?

[01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:54.710]
I'll be called back probably WDRC. He'll call you on the bat line and tell you he's not doing anything anyway. That was depressing, you know

[01:11:56.210 --> 01:11:57.090]
Just sitting around

[01:11:57.770 --> 01:12:03.430]
Watch in TV and of course he's seen all the reruns of those all of you've seen all the flipper reruns a million times by now and

[01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:05.390]
all those other

[01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:11.970]
Cornball shows he likes the monsters. He's seen all of those 4,000 times and he ought to be on a year somewhere

[01:12:12.610 --> 01:12:15.750]
Like maybe like part time like you're doing the summertime or something. I'm sorry

[01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:17.450]
Well, that's right. So it's in fact Suss

[01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:21.130]
I know he calls and pretends to be your friend when you know you're champ with him off the air

[01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:24.590]
But the fact of the matter is he's really waiting till Monday. Okay, I think I'm gonna

[01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:28.230]
Reckham's friendship. What you can't pay the rent with friendship. That's right

[01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:32.270]
Yeah, he mentioned that to me very quietly you weren't listening

[01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:37.850]
So anyway WQA and Alice Branigan writes in January of 1923

[01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:46.410]
The Department of Commerce issued a broadcasting license to the electrical equipment company 42 Northwest 14 fourth street in Miami

[01:12:46.410 --> 01:12:51.190]
The auto and radio sales slash service company was owned by WW loose

[01:12:54.690 --> 01:13:01.450]
His new station WQA was authorized to operate with 250 watts almost as much as we got now on 833

[01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:04.030]
833

[01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:12.030]
Whoever heard of a frequency that ended, you know, well like a odd number like QA was the southern most broadcasting station in the US

[01:13:12.030 --> 01:13:17.430]
This is 1923. That's almost 80 freaking years ago. No wonder it's almost the in here

[01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:23.010]
For whatever reason within a few brief months WQA had cut its power back to a hundred watts

[01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:31.110]
In those days the government was driving stations crazy by constantly reorganizing their frequency assignments

[01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:38.030]
This was the Department of Commerce's inept attempt at dealing with the rapidly expanding service through government regulations governing brought though government regulations

[01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:45.970]
Gov. What is it though regulations governing broadcasting were virtual non-existent by early 24 the government relocated QM to 1140

[01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:51.710]
But by July they again ordered to move to a thousand just like WCFL in Chicago a thousand

[01:13:51.710 --> 01:13:58.530]
By the end of 24 the station had been told to shift to 1120 only to be sent back to 1140 in July of 25 by that time

[01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:02.170]
QM was calling itself the pioneer broadcast station of Florida

[01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:15.270]
Stations were not universally pleased with their newly mandated frequency reassignments during this period of no radio regulation

[01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:19.890]
It was a common practice for stations to ignore federal assignments and simply use their own favorite channels

[01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:25.650]
Yeah, as a matter of fact we're moving to 940 tomorrow because that the

[01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:32.050]
Cheap channel is ruled that frequency did we ever put I and Z on air or not now we didn't know nobody ever called and said oh

[01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:34.010]
Yeah, that used to be very big here. I don't know

[01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:41.650]
Let's see there's to ignore in 9 November 25 QM reportedly jumped to the unauthorized frequency of 1050

[01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:46.510]
Which also used to be a chit a CHUM in Toronto and WMGM in New York and then WHN

[01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:53.850]
Using one kilowatt those still authorized for 1140 with 100 watts you following that they moved to 1050 using a thousand watts

[01:14:53.850 --> 01:14:57.270]
Although they were authorized for 1140 on the route with 100 watts

[01:14:58.550 --> 01:15:06.350]
Okay, yeah, what's the difference QM was still my only year round broadcasted because WIOD WMBF shut down during the summer

[01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:09.850]
Not that it was a seasonal town or horse and buggy place

[01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:15.870]
It's almost enough to make me want to play that the thing with Jean sister Jean the radio machine or whatever name was but not not quite

[01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:23.930]
In the spring of 1927 the newly formed FCC assigned WQM to 930 got me been all over the dial and still got a crappy signal

[01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:30.850]
Promoting the station operate with 750 watts by November QM was shifted to 780 and I'm getting ahead

[01:15:30.850 --> 01:15:36.950]
H's Readness in late 28 QM was moved to 1240 by early 29 the new licensee became the Miami broadcasting company

[01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:42.530]
They increased power to a thousand watts and moved the studios to Miami's postal building 327 Northeast 1st Avenue

[01:15:42.530 --> 01:15:50.010]
The Western electric transmitter was relocated to the 15th floor of the realty board building 600 biskeying boulevard when these changes were completed WQM shifted

[01:15:50.010 --> 01:15:52.210]
Stop position to 560

[01:15:53.610 --> 01:15:59.550]
In January of 32 QM's transmitter was moved to the top of the Miami daily news building and 38 it was again moved to the waters

[01:15:59.550 --> 01:16:03.470]
Edged this game in 14th Street where new 224 foot self-supporting

[01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:08.510]
Blondock's vertical tower was installed the station slogan became the voice of tropical America

[01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:17.870]
In 1941 WQM received a permit to increase its daytime power to 5,000 watts and this was complained and of course, you know

[01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:20.730]
We can go 50,000 watts. That's what Greg told me

[01:16:20.730 --> 01:16:26.070]
He sucked me into coming over to this horse ball place. We can go 50,000. I said yeah chickens can pee too

[01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:29.970]
But nobody told him to lift their leg and you know we did lift his leg right up in the air

[01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:33.730]
In 1947 a new 380 foot tall lehigh

[01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:39.750]
Self-supported vertical radiating antenna was installed on a pier extending out into viscane bay at 1425

[01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:44.090]
Northeast Bay Shore Court just out of the Venetian causeways Miami terminus

[01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:52.170]
In 1949 QM studios removed a sweet 1723 in the Alfred I do pond building a downtime Miami in 56 the station was sold at Todd's stores

[01:16:52.170 --> 01:16:57.590]
Midcontinent broadcast and company later be known as the stores broadcasting company. That's what it was in its heyday

[01:16:58.870 --> 01:17:05.670]
The studios and offices were moved in 62 to the Mezzanine floor of Miami's McAllister hotel as 40,000 people appointed out to us

[01:17:05.670 --> 01:17:12.190]
A permit was also issued that you to change the transmitter site in 65 the station's main studio was relocated to 767

[01:17:12.190 --> 01:17:19.630]
41st Street in Miami Beach the studios ran their till 85 when they were relocated to 98 81 Sheridan Street in Hollywood in early 88

[01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:21.970]
Oh, that must be the trailer they're talking about the dump

[01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:27.910]
That's sore that toilet the red infested bug infested is the Humper used to say

[01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:32.190]
Boy, it's a 98 81 Sheridan Street where your dog wouldn't go in there

[01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:37.450]
I'll tell you that right now the transmitter was moved away some new site near Miami and can I commenced a M stereo operation?

[01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:38.290]
We're stereo

[01:17:41.610 --> 01:17:42.630]
We're in stereo

[01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.970]
It's not no mo

[01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:51.490]
That's what it says here the old 5K continental transmitter was put up for sale QM had been running your country music format

[01:17:51.490 --> 01:17:54.530]
But in 90 the station added oldies and sports talk

[01:17:55.010 --> 01:18:02.890]
Sport hole talk the country music format was dropped that was continuing out over the FM outlet kiss where Johnny Dark is doing weekends 2 to 7 at

[01:18:02.890 --> 01:18:03.650]
Bokaratone

[01:18:03.650 --> 01:18:10.190]
Oh, you know something I realized that kisses in Bokar. I thought they're right down the street here. They are they are what right down the street

[01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:19.170]
So what does that mean at Bokaratone you will have the oldies music lasted till 93 when the format was changed to all sports and the station became known as sports radio 560 in mid 96

[01:18:19.170 --> 01:18:27.530]
The station law with kiss became the property of the sunshine wireless company the two live Jews as sports radio 560 QM operates full time yada yada

[01:18:28.890 --> 01:18:35.010]
Thanks to broadcast profile for permitting us to extra information from their lengthy report on WQ. YM yada yada

[01:18:36.370 --> 01:18:43.530]
It's a sunshine wireless purchase the station in 85 then sold it to be easily broadcasting in 1996 the current cheap ass owners

[01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:48.890]
Although George did finally get his bonus the current it says that right there the current cheap ass owners

[01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:50.590]
But they're Yahoo's from up in a tree

[01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:54.170]
Who pawned their banjo and still can't afford to pay anybody?

[01:18:54.690 --> 01:18:57.270]
How do you like that? Huh? Little radio intensive here boys and girls

[01:18:57.270 --> 01:19:00.090]
I know a lot of you young punk's out there now. Let's see. How old would you have to be?

[01:19:00.090 --> 01:19:05.910]
But you're not that old you're getting old, but you're not that old 37 about how old you have to be remember like the when a

[01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:09.450]
M top 40 stations were still going pretty strong. What was the end of that?

[01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:10.770]
I don't know

[01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:17.490]
Well, why not 70 something I would imagine mid 70 70 when it started to really disappear. Yeah

[01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:21.170]
Well, let's see. I came here in 76 and

[01:19:22.730 --> 01:19:24.670]
in 76 I

[01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:27.790]
Think GBS was still playing music

[01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:32.250]
I and Z was doing all news. I just remember the mid 70s being the beginnings of like

[01:19:33.150 --> 01:19:37.690]
Let's pick a year 75 all right. Just pick a year 75 would be 27 years ago

[01:19:38.210 --> 01:19:40.230]
So if you were like what eight or ten?

[01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:45.790]
All right, huh? Sure, I mean kid when you were a little kid you listen to the radio sure

[01:19:46.170 --> 01:19:52.150]
So let's see where like 10 years old so that would be twice as to me like you're let's say 35 plus if you're 35 plus

[01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:55.730]
Then you remember some of this and you remember when your radio was a wonderful thing when it's business for you staff

[01:19:56.230 --> 01:20:02.870]
personalities people you would tune into listen to and they'd move from one station to another and you'd follow them because they were they meant something

[01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:07.030]
Like Dick pertinent Detroit. He's been on like 75 different stations

[01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:11.610]
And no matter where he goes people tune in because he's legendary because he's a talent because he means something

[01:20:12.490 --> 01:20:15.710]
See if you go from one station to another one and nobody listens it means like

[01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:19.130]
You're not a talent. You have no following say you have no following

[01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:24.470]
Boy you went move from one station to another one and he had these big gigantic juicy ratings like

[01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:29.330]
Very few people in the business have been able to do over the years. This sounds very self-aggrandizing of course it is

[01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:34.750]
I shouldn't feel bitter about anything though because we got the new monitor for you there

[01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:39.650]
We got the vents have been like moved in so the air is blowing like distributing nice and even in here

Elvis Presley, he's got a lot of living to do.

[01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:36.910]
Elvis in our spotlights, and this is a command for once.

[01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:39.150]
This is Hans number one favorite.

[01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:41.930]
I forgot to remember to forget Elvis.

[01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:47.150]

[01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:47.870]
Yes, sir.

[01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:54.090]
In our spotlights tonight, the very fantastic Elvis Presley,

[01:25:54.090 --> 01:25:57.870]
the man who has had in a role consecutively,

[01:25:58.250 --> 01:26:01.550]
fifteen or sixteen better than a million sellers.

[01:26:02.710 --> 01:26:04.490]
This young lad has a great feeling,

[01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:07.510]
feeling that the teenagers understand for music,

[01:26:08.110 --> 01:26:11.150]
and of course, a feeling that gets through to a lot of older people,

[01:26:11.650 --> 01:26:13.350]
that digs the music of the common man.

[01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:15.390]
That's what Elvis portrays.

[01:26:15.710 --> 01:26:17.930]
Listen right now as he does the rhythm and blues favor.

stick together I was Joe Costello I said it Joe Costello wouldn't know this

[01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:32.830]
looks like you you think that Joe Costello knows these radio stations no where

[01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:37.690]
he's he lived all his life here right so how do I know and he would know if you

[01:30:46.410 --> 01:30:50.770]
stations he wouldn't he just in addition which didn't we just figure out a few

[01:30:50.770 --> 01:30:53.370]
months ago that he's never been anywhere which is why I talked him in a

[01:30:53.370 --> 01:30:58.410]
coming up to Toronto where he and his buddies had a great time yes although he

[01:30:58.410 --> 01:31:03.090]
want to do you know that he went up there via Boston with a stop with a bad

[01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:07.450]

be the time to be flying through Logan Airport in Boston this would be a great

[01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:15.310]
time to be doing that nice going Joe but they had a great time anyway I'm not

[01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:18.750]
knocking Joe but the fact is what does he know about radio and if you want to

[01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:21.850]
fight out tune in to the six tonight overnight and you'll discover what he

[01:31:21.850 --> 01:31:25.650]
knows about radio and then listen between six and six thirty and you'll fight

[01:31:25.650 --> 01:31:28.150]
out for a second time in case you missed it the first time what you'll

[01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:31.650]

[01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:29.930]
He can wait. Joey can wait, you know?

[01:35:30.610 --> 01:35:31.450]
He's an asshole.

[01:35:31.650 --> 01:35:35.450]
Yeah, because he says 1520 on the dial was 50,000 watts,

[01:35:35.490 --> 01:35:37.010]
Which George Lerence they were just playing a promo.

[01:35:37.230 --> 01:35:40.450]
He says, I used to listen to J. Nelson as a teen,

[01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:41.410]
Along with all the others.

[01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:44.510]
Well, I don't have any ear checks from KVW on J. Nelson.

[01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:46.390]
But, Chum and Toronto baby,

[01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:47.810]
George Lerence.

[01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:49.630]
Marine Gary Lewis, John Time is five,

[01:35:49.770 --> 01:35:53.570]
And it's half 2 7 o'clock on the J. Nelson show 16 degrees outside today's eye.

[01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:55.190]
We'll get up there 30 degrees.

[01:35:58.690 --> 01:36:00.070]
Hey, good morning, John G.

[01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:01.590]
I had what's the problem.

[01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:03.190]
Now I have the worst luck.

[01:36:03.730 --> 01:36:04.270]
What happened?

[01:36:04.770 --> 01:36:06.530]
Sorry, brick, money, laying in three places.

[01:36:07.130 --> 01:36:07.430]
Aware.

[01:36:08.170 --> 01:36:08.610]
Vancouver.

[01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:10.950]
Montreal and Halifax.

[01:36:14.710 --> 01:36:15.970]
Back in the new array.

[01:36:17.710 --> 01:36:19.950]
How can just one calorie taste so good?

[01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:23.410]
It's seven minutes after 7 o'clock, 16 degrees outside to win this door.

[01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:24.590]
It's 11 miles an hour today.

[01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:25.630]
It's high time at 2 minutes 30.

[01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:29.810]
And for Bob McAdoy and the crowd who are going down the sea bring today to see the big sea bring races.

[01:36:30.710 --> 01:36:34.150]
We've got the sea bring weather bureau coming through with their direct weather report.

[01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:35.370]
I hope the screws doesn't get bad.

[01:36:35.370 --> 01:36:37.290]
Place the log and then go on there.

[01:36:38.010 --> 01:36:40.390]
The direct weather report will be coming up at 7.15 this morning.

[01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:42.990]
The operator says at 7.15 you should be able to get through.

[01:36:43.610 --> 01:36:46.690]
So I guess they've been really bombarded around race time down there.

[01:36:47.110 --> 01:36:52.210]
And just before the race is because everybody from all over the country is checking in with the weather.

[01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:54.890]
Just to see what the weather will be when they get there and on race day.

[01:36:55.290 --> 01:36:58.290]
Hi today near 30, a clear with a few cloudy periods today.

[01:37:00.190 --> 01:37:01.690]
Gary Marsden has a great saw.

[01:37:01.850 --> 01:37:03.650]
I can saw the way to number three in the shot chart.

[01:37:03.650 --> 01:37:05.710]
This is a very trustworthy.

[01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:08.330]
That's very close.

[01:37:08.530 --> 01:37:10.050]
The mercy 10 minutes after 7 o'clock.

[01:37:10.050 --> 01:37:10.930]
Good morning to you, John.

[01:37:11.010 --> 01:37:11.510]
Thank you.

[01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:12.810]
There you go. Just for a road.

[01:37:12.970 --> 01:37:14.810]
I mean I didn't find him very exciting.

[01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:16.470]
But it's just a couple of minute air check.

[01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:18.990]
Maybe he was great on KB.

[01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:20.010]
But maybe not.

[01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:21.410]
Another big top 40 station.

[01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:25.630]
David says with their smaller market was super 50 KF-XD and Boise Idaho.

[01:37:26.290 --> 01:37:27.130]
Oh, you should know that one.

[01:37:27.450 --> 01:37:30.250]
Oh, 5,000 watts.

[01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:31.870]
That's a tough 7 Western states at night.

[01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:34.270]
You know, like Idaho and Wyoming.

[01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:35.190]
Montana.

[01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:37.410]
And Montana and Iowa states where nobody lives.

[01:37:38.670 --> 01:37:41.330]
Ask Eric to set you up a simple comments for him on the website.

[01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:44.170]
We enter suggestions and you see them on your super secret page only.

[01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:45.630]
He can limit to just a few characters.

[01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:47.770]
So no problems with the chronic sending too much crap.

[01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:51.190]
One click by you. They're either gone or moved to the just to go all the paper you'll save.

[01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:54.550]
Now also I mentioned WFU and Vawana Johnny.

[01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:56.050]
Who's on here? You heard that this morning.

[01:37:56.050 --> 01:37:56.930]
I'll play. I'll get to that.

[01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:59.530]
Also memory from AM, but not a particular station.

[01:37:59.650 --> 01:38:00.330]
Dr. Demento.

[01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:02.930]
Maybe Dr. Demento might be on here. I'm sure he's on some website.

[01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:04.210]
But more importantly than that.

[01:38:04.730 --> 01:38:06.530]
I found chicken man on there today.

[01:38:07.730 --> 01:38:08.470]
I like to suds.

[01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:12.770]
Such would probably reach down and scratch his ass if he heard chicken man.

[01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:13.130]
You know what?

[01:38:14.050 --> 01:38:16.190]
From inside his pants. He'd probably go nuts.

[01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:18.030]
Do you remember chicken man?

[01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:19.310]
Or did you just hear that? You know?

[01:38:20.190 --> 01:38:21.330]
Well, I'll get to it.

[01:38:21.810 --> 01:38:22.790]
I'll eventually get to it.

[01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:24.550]
But I think Eric can close this out now, don't you?

[01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:25.870]
Please.

[01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:28.390]
Because we can always add to it later, but it's almost 1130 already.

[01:38:28.590 --> 01:38:29.730]
Let's get the show on the road, eh?

[01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:32.810]
We got a lengthy list of you tuning in midstream. You missed all the good stuff.

[01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:36.590]
The greatest AM top 40 radio station ever was.

[01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:38.410]
Here's our list so far.

[01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:48.470]
WQAM, WFUN, WCFL, WLS, WABC, WKNR, KENER-13 Detroit, WYBG, WAPE, the big ape.

[01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:51.630]
All right, I haven't played the big APA anyway.

[01:38:52.330 --> 01:38:55.470]
The grease man, we will. WMGM, KHJ.

[01:38:56.110 --> 01:38:59.050]
You know, when I was in LA many, many years ago and they were still very big.

[01:38:59.270 --> 01:39:01.470]
And that's all these KHJ. It's all they said.

[01:39:01.810 --> 01:39:03.810]
They play a lot of music. KHJ, great.

[01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:08.110]
CKLW, CHUM Toronto, which we just heard Jane Ellsson pretty boring.

[01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:16.170]
WSYZ Detroit, WBZ, WMEX, WKVW, WFIL, WHK Cleveland, KFI.

[01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:18.590]
Are you sure?

[01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:25.790]
Yeah. WWWE, Triffle, WEE, WO, WO, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 1190 on the dial.

[01:39:27.110 --> 01:39:30.790]
Fort Wayne, Kamataki is brought to you by K-A-A-Y, Little Rock.

[01:39:31.130 --> 01:39:31.930]
Is that right?

[01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:33.530]
I don't know.

[01:39:34.490 --> 01:39:38.150]
KNPC for all the West Coast people again. WJB, KDTroyd.

[01:39:38.230 --> 01:39:42.070]
I think that's, I think Robyn Seymour worked on WJB, and also Jack DeBelboy.

[01:39:44.670 --> 01:39:47.210]
Well, what am I talking to you about? You don't know your Detroit, Mr. E.

[01:39:47.210 --> 01:39:48.450]
You know what? You're not missing much.

[01:39:48.930 --> 01:39:51.230]
And those days it was great. That was Martha June the CooN.

[01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:54.690]
She wasn't on that station. She was on W. What was it?

[01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:59.370]
Inxter. Well, I don't know what she was on. WMCA, maybe drugs.

[01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:04.470]
KQV, KDKA, Pittsburgh. How come? Well, we didn't have that one facts about all the people who were on there.

[01:40:04.570 --> 01:40:06.870]
We just courted it on all those people. And Wendy King.

[01:40:07.250 --> 01:40:13.570]
And Bob Prince. WRKO, WOR, WNBC, WYNS, 1010 Wins, New York, Murray the K.

[01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:18.930]
KJR, and KOL, that's from SUDs who must know something about it because they used to work up there.

[01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:23.450]
WTOP in Washington, which I pulled out of my ass, and WDRC, which, uh,

[01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:28.210]
I pulled out of his ass. Now easily, but with some difficulty.

[01:40:28.530 --> 01:40:30.990]
So there you go for the pretty interesting list there for you so far.

[01:40:31.290 --> 01:40:33.090]
And I think we can get it up right now.

[01:40:36.850 --> 01:40:39.090]
Although, let's see, Rock Radio's scrapbook.

[01:40:39.230 --> 01:40:41.270]
Oh, this just gives me goosebumps.

[01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:46.610]
There is a Dave Maynard clip on here, which I might get to.

[01:40:46.710 --> 01:40:48.530]
Although I did play Bruce Bradley before it ended up in BZ.

[01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:53.170]
See what I'm trying to impress on you is that radio doesn't have to be the piece of crap that it's turned into.

[01:40:53.410 --> 01:40:59.890]
Thanks to the FCC, thanks to the Grave Robbers, thanks to the people like Chief Channel and the other companies that own 99% of the guy that I'm stations in the world.

[01:40:59.890 --> 01:41:07.030]
It should be great. It should be entertaining. If you have personalities, you should have people that mean something in this business other than opening a pot no matter where you are in the country.

[01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:08.830]
And here in the same goddamn crap.

[01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:13.750]
Lordass Limbo and Dr. Laura and G Gordon Litty makes me giddy.

[01:41:14.010 --> 01:41:14.750]
All of a sudden the crap.

[01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:16.310]
Garbage.

[01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:22.530]
And you know something about the only thing that was like that back then, you know, who is the only one that you can hear like an almost every market?

[01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:24.690]
Paul Harvey. Oh, yeah. Good day.

[01:41:25.150 --> 01:41:26.590]
You have to have to play Paul Harvey.

[01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:28.230]
There you go. How about that?

[01:41:30.110 --> 01:41:35.050]
But other than that, all stations had their own personalities, their own people had meant something.

[01:41:35.670 --> 01:41:39.450]
Let's see, Jeff, I love Jefferson K. He was one of my favorite DJs of all time.

[01:41:41.150 --> 01:41:44.530]
Let's see, while playing top 40 music, WBZ still likes the top 40 present.

[01:41:44.670 --> 01:41:48.250]
Oh, it's, we don't need every line up the WBZ ever had. Is that what this is?

[01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:54.450]
Oh, and it's got pictures. There's Jay Dunn and Ron Landry and Bruce Bradley.

[01:41:56.050 --> 01:41:58.910]
And how about what's his name? He used to work over and I would eliminate St. Larry Glick.

[01:41:59.190 --> 01:42:00.270]
You remember Larry Glick? Yeah.

[01:42:01.450 --> 01:42:04.070]
We've talked about Larry Glick and the only thing that I remember from the inside.

[01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:05.130]
You don't know who he is.

[01:42:05.770 --> 01:42:09.090]
And what do Larry Glick is doing? I think he's working on some 10 Watts stations.

[01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:13.070]
See, that's what happened to a lot of people. A lot of the good people in this business got screwed over bad.

[01:42:13.530 --> 01:42:16.610]
And they had to like scramble to put together like a make-believe living, you know.

[01:42:17.110 --> 01:42:21.010]
And then there were people who weren't any good in the first place who had a scramble like Mr. Ego, for example.

[01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:28.730]
How could you work on a station that was as hot as W. Stoos was in those days, even though we had old geriatric numbers, but we still had big numbers.

[01:42:29.010 --> 01:42:31.170]
How could you work on a station like that and have no numbers, you know.

[01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:34.790]
Unless maybe everybody painted you like poison? There might be it, Steve.

[01:42:36.730 --> 01:42:38.130]
That might have something to do with it.

[01:42:38.670 --> 01:42:43.050]
That's why I was so good when he went over to Lightbulb because those fractions he had over there were, you know, he was used to them.

[01:42:43.110 --> 01:42:45.570]
And they were nice and comfortable. Those 0.7s and 1 shares.

[01:42:46.850 --> 01:42:50.110]
Carl D'Sou is Dave Maynard, Jay Dunn, Bruce Bradley, Jefferson K.

[01:42:51.710 --> 01:42:52.270]
Dick Summer.

[01:42:53.010 --> 01:42:56.170]
Dick Summer, who wrote me a nice note one time. Many years ago, did I ever mention that to you?

[01:42:56.410 --> 01:43:01.930]
No. Dick Summer, in fact Dick was in New York and wrote me a note about how he happened to be in town here, heard the show and what a great talent I was.

[01:43:02.170 --> 01:43:04.530]
Thanks Dick, and I'm still here in this God-per-sac-in-place.

[01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:07.750]
Although the good news is I get out of here most of the year. Get out of this place.

[01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:12.690]
And that is a good deal. I'll tell you what, I'm not going to knock that. I'm not going to bitch and bully you about that.

[01:43:12.690 --> 01:43:17.130]
Being able to do the show from Amsterdam to Toronto and be able to do the same damn thing is great.

[01:43:18.230 --> 01:43:22.690]
In fact, I think some of those days when I was doing the One Hit Wonders from Toronto, those are pretty good shows.

[01:43:23.710 --> 01:43:27.910]
Even though that chronic fact, you know, writes me that caustic fact. No, that was when I was here.

[01:43:28.570 --> 01:43:32.910]
Bitching and bull. Oh, One Hit Wonders. Terminal Pon was you're not going to really do this to us, are you?

[01:43:33.130 --> 01:43:37.810]
Yeah. See if there's a day when I'm doing a show that you don't care for. You're, you get a pass, okay?

[01:43:37.810 --> 01:43:46.830]
Well, right, you are just like in school, like in kindergarten. A dismissal slip, one of those little little slips that says you have, no, they're called dismissal slips. Like a L-pass.

[01:43:47.170 --> 01:43:53.990]
L-passo, L-passo from class O. And we'll let you go do something else. W-A-Q-A-M.

[01:43:55.290 --> 01:43:56.010]
John Butter.

[01:43:58.110 --> 01:43:59.070]
W-A-Q-A-M.

[01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:05.410]
Hey, tell me if you want to take a look at music radio 77.com.

[01:44:06.190 --> 01:44:06.550]
Okay.

[01:44:07.210 --> 01:44:12.110]
That's just about everything from W-A-B-C-B from the time it came on, until the time it went off.

[01:44:12.270 --> 01:44:13.750]
Is Pune Scott Mune on her, I bet?

[01:44:14.370 --> 01:44:16.050]
Yes, he is. Actually, everything is on there, yeah.

[01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:17.490]
Okay, thanks.

[01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:18.190]
Okay, bye.

[01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:21.210]
And what's it then to go who died from AIDS, Bob, Bob Lewis.

[01:44:22.170 --> 01:44:22.810]
Bob Lewis.

[01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:24.310]
Remember, do you remember Bob Lewis?

[01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:25.110]
I remember the name.

[01:44:25.190 --> 01:44:29.390]
You used to do Las Bals or some clothing store in Jersey. That's, he was good. He was good, DJ.

[01:44:30.170 --> 01:44:33.270]
They didn't have any bad DJs except of course for cousin Brucey.

[01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:36.310]
Yeah, you know, in fact, he's the one that calls and does that, you know.

[01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:37.550]
That's really him.

[01:44:37.610 --> 01:44:38.910]
Yeah, I think that's him.

[01:44:39.630 --> 01:44:42.250]
Just like it was Don Johnson, I call Stan Major that time.

[01:44:42.330 --> 01:44:42.810]
Wasn't that him?

[01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:44.010]
Was that Don?

[01:44:44.230 --> 01:44:44.930]
No, wasn't that Don?

[01:44:45.610 --> 01:44:46.410]
I think that was Don.

[01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.990]
Stan Major.

[01:44:49.810 --> 01:44:50.170]
Wow.

[01:44:51.390 --> 01:44:53.010]
26 after 11 at 5.60.

[01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:56.190]
I'm not going to push me because I'm not going to tell the episode on the year.

[01:44:56.190 --> 01:44:56.570]
What was I doing?

[01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:58.530]
You were going to try to stir up crap.

[01:44:58.870 --> 01:45:00.070]
You are a crap, this derberl.

[01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.730]
Let's face it, man.

[01:45:00.730 --> 01:45:02.090]
Yeah, I just threw up a little crap.

[01:45:02.210 --> 01:45:02.570]
Love Stan.

[01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.790]
You do?

[01:45:04.170 --> 01:45:05.730]
Well, didn't he hook us up? That's what he told me.

[01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:07.570]
Hook two up.

[01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:11.090]
Me and you. He's the one that said that, uh, hey, there's this guy that isn't bad when you were up to him.

[01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:13.590]
Larry, glick is retired and lives in Del Ray Beach.

[01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:14.190]
Love you, Larry.

[01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:17.330]
Hope he's having a wonderful life. Good guy.

[01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:21.150]
Excellent guy. He had a fun show overnight on WBZ for years.

[01:45:21.690 --> 01:45:22.590]
For a long time.

[01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.910]
Larry Glick.

[01:45:24.450 --> 01:45:25.470]
You don't remember Larry Glick?

[01:45:25.610 --> 01:45:25.750]
No.

[01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:31.270]
26 after 11 at 560 WBZ.

[01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:32.870]
We're trying to revive radio, man.

[01:45:33.010 --> 01:45:36.190]
We're trying to like take some oxygen and pump it into your radio and put some liby.

[01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:38.890]
I know realize this is not the right place to be doing that, but why the hell not?

[01:45:39.230 --> 01:45:39.830]
Why not me?

[01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:43.210]
I'm always the Schmidt to stir, but anyway, trying to stir the pot.

[01:45:43.650 --> 01:45:45.070]
Do I stir it in George's mocks it?

[01:45:45.690 --> 01:45:47.730]
In fact, that's probably why he's burning that incense right now.

[01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:48.890]
It smells really good, you know?

[01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:51.410]
Was Miguel farting while he was in there or where he was?

[01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.970]
Oh, you were.

[01:45:52.050 --> 01:45:52.390]
I've been.

[01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:53.430]
You wonder he ran out of there?

[01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:54.130]
I still am.

[01:45:54.130 --> 01:45:58.330]
No, you're just trying to get even with him for his intempered behavior yesterday when he bitched you out.

[01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:59.970]
And said he was some kind of a spicker.

[01:46:00.110 --> 01:46:01.190]
What was he upset about?

[01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:02.650]
Something like that.

[01:46:02.650 --> 01:46:05.130]
Because he never gives us the liners to read at the beginning of the show.

[01:46:05.410 --> 01:46:07.690]
Oh, and I had the nerve to take issue with that.

[01:46:07.770 --> 01:46:10.210]
And not only that, but then he brings an address in here about Glades Row.

[01:46:10.210 --> 01:46:11.550]
And I'm supposed to know it's in Boca.

[01:46:11.810 --> 01:46:12.550]
I don't go to Boca.

[01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.390]
Okay.

[01:46:13.810 --> 01:46:14.290]
Why not?

[01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:16.050]
Because somebody lives in Boca.

[01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:17.850]
I don't want to be anywhere.

[01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:19.970]
I don't want to smell that piece, you know?

[01:46:21.190 --> 01:46:24.170]
Get that, get downwind of that thing and man, you can just about pass out.

[01:46:24.710 --> 01:46:27.930]

Mathy Snatch is good, man.

[01:48:13.230 --> 01:48:14.610]
Mathy Snatch is good.

Mathy Snatch is good.

[01:48:29.190 --> 01:48:34.470]
I'm a reading sponsor of the girl who wants to be a media home, and prefers it on top quiver.

[01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:37.450]
You want power? On this lady is what I'll give you

[01:48:37.450 --> 01:48:39.430]
She's got a book to read about Slammering

[01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:41.610]
Nobody knows for about Slammering out

[01:48:41.610 --> 01:48:44.610]
With a big scoop of mouth and a one to the left of Mangala

[01:48:44.610 --> 01:48:47.370]
Such a good Christian girl, you want to strangle her

[01:48:47.890 --> 01:48:49.170]
Fontyfogating who she's hating

[01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:52.290]
Political pundits, pontificating, shrunk on the floor

[01:48:52.290 --> 01:48:53.450]
And masturbating

[01:48:53.450 --> 01:48:55.770]
A Republican's canky hoes

[01:48:55.770 --> 01:48:57.670]
She's a federalist, emote

[01:48:57.670 --> 01:49:00.050]
Making liberalism dirty word, you know

[01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:01.830]
In a many-sturch showing capital

[01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:04.070]
I know and found guilty of murdering extra friends

[01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:06.090]
And go to all work, kicking me

[01:49:06.090 --> 01:49:08.210]
In a many-sturch, that spells fishy

[01:49:08.210 --> 01:49:10.570]
She's a tall drink of water on the side of a large order

[01:49:10.570 --> 01:49:12.850]
With a back alley up, give me like your broad stallor

[01:49:12.850 --> 01:49:14.750]
If you got the money, she'll spread those legs

[01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:16.790]
With the cigarette and the sharp name

[01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:19.290]
And go to their end-culture, political pundit

[01:49:19.290 --> 01:49:20.870]
The angel of the right, everything's easy

[01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:22.730]
Merry Christmas, cards, or thank you notes

[01:49:22.730 --> 01:49:25.370]
Be sure to bundle them, mark for in-zone

[01:49:25.370 --> 01:49:26.670]
Or out of town delivery

[01:49:26.670 --> 01:49:30.150]
This will help your host off a skiff into their destination sooner

[01:49:30.150 --> 01:49:32.450]
Here everybody fun to lose Christmas, okay?

[01:49:32.450 --> 01:49:34.210]
Ladies and gentlemen

[01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:37.650]
I have the honor to reject WMV action

[01:49:37.650 --> 01:49:38.490]
Hello

[01:49:38.490 --> 01:49:40.390]
Not the heart against work, can I train?

[01:49:40.590 --> 01:49:42.870]
Show WMV X-Metion Dollar Weekend

[01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:43.730]
Live it up, baby

[01:49:43.730 --> 01:49:46.450]
If we can, weigh the action in

[01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:49.710]
If we can, stop with your MVH

[01:49:49.710 --> 01:49:52.410]
Hey, we're going with the beat of rubber soul album

[01:49:52.410 --> 01:49:54.110]
My two favorite selections are

[01:49:54.110 --> 01:49:55.030]
Norwegian Wood

[01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.990]
Isn't it good?

[01:49:56.370 --> 01:49:58.190]
And Michelle, isn't she swell?

[01:49:58.850 --> 01:50:00.010]
People time again

[01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:01.970]
Oh, she's so cute

[01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:03.730]
You want to talk about the origin?

[01:50:04.210 --> 01:50:05.850]
I think you measured that play the whole thing in the song

[01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:12.030]
You know how you solve that?

[01:50:13.630 --> 01:50:16.030]
You get your real player on there and you would dig it ahead

[01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:16.850]
You know the play thing?

[01:50:19.570 --> 01:50:19.930]
What?

[01:50:21.230 --> 01:50:22.770]
I said, we'll be two more

[01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:39.050]
Okay, Ernie was nice hearing from me, but we don't have time to dig around with that thing

[01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.790]
Bad air check

[01:50:40.370 --> 01:50:42.190]
Wu-Wu Ginzberg never heard of him either

[01:50:42.890 --> 01:50:43.630]
Wu-Wu

[01:50:43.630 --> 01:50:44.490]
Adventure car hop

[01:50:44.490 --> 01:50:47.370]
In August, you played stuff by that

[01:50:47.370 --> 01:50:48.330]
Of that

[01:50:48.330 --> 01:50:49.070]
Yeah

[01:50:49.730 --> 01:50:51.790]
I had because we used to stop, we just telling Muff

[01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:54.150]
We used to stop by there on a way to Rock and Am Park from Boston

[01:50:54.150 --> 01:50:56.350]
Drive up US1, it would be Adventure car hop

[01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:58.390]
It was just like in

[01:50:58.390 --> 01:51:01.450]
What was the movie American, Not American Pie, American graffiti

[01:51:02.250 --> 01:51:03.150]
Just like that

[01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:09.950]
The traditional 50s and early 60s driving with the old car, with the real, not old, with the young chicks

[01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:10.570]
The car hops

[01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:12.450]
Right, Camarita to your window

[01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:14.950]
With the big shakes and malts

[01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:15.610]
The real ones

[01:51:16.250 --> 01:51:17.670]
A&W had a few of those

[01:51:17.670 --> 01:51:18.290]
Yeah, like that

[01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:21.830]
But, oh, this was a great place to venture car hop

[01:51:22.350 --> 01:51:25.130]
Then we go up to Rock and Am Park lose whatever money we had left at the track

[01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:29.610]
Here's the fact that it says this may be a stupid question, but how do ratings work

[01:51:29.610 --> 01:51:31.370]
I mean, how do they put the book together all of that?

[01:51:31.450 --> 01:51:32.970]
Well, they pick it out of a hat rhymes with that

[01:51:34.250 --> 01:51:36.550]
Is it kind of a voting system or is it measured in some way?

[01:51:36.630 --> 01:51:38.890]
This is something I've always wondered nobody's explained, thank you

[01:51:38.890 --> 01:51:42.530]
Well, I'll tell you this, they sent out diaries and you write down deer diary

[01:51:42.530 --> 01:51:42.910]
Yeah

[01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:46.370]
Today I listen to this one, today I think I listen to that one

[01:51:46.370 --> 01:51:48.390]
They sent out diaries, they pick them scientifically

[01:51:49.050 --> 01:51:51.390]
Out of the geographical areas of their ass

[01:51:51.390 --> 01:51:54.210]
They only go to responsible people that are very accurate about what they write down

[01:51:54.210 --> 01:51:56.990]
And that especially the darker they are and the, unless they speak English

[01:51:56.990 --> 01:52:00.650]
The more likely they to get to die, the reason they get paid for filling them out too by the way, which is true

[01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:02.790]
And that's it and that's what you got

[01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:04.770]
That's what we have to place our entire livelihoods on

[01:52:04.770 --> 01:52:07.230]
That's why this coming Monday is a day

[01:52:07.230 --> 01:52:10.270]
It is so explosive, you know, people are walking around the hall here

[01:52:10.270 --> 01:52:12.090]
Pretend to be in a jocular mood

[01:52:12.090 --> 01:52:14.690]
But the pressure is momentous

[01:52:14.690 --> 01:52:16.610]
Now, let's see, today's the 17th

[01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:19.190]
The sales people are living for Vegas when?

[01:52:19.710 --> 01:52:20.430]
The 23rd

[01:52:21.010 --> 01:52:22.710]
I think it's the 23rd through the 30th

[01:52:23.610 --> 01:52:27.750]
Well, that's good because that gives them, that means they'll be here Monday is the 21st and the 2nd

[01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:31.710]
Which are the 2 days when we get the actual book and then the 22nd we can usually get that breakdown

[01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:34.610]
And then the 23rd everybody has a breakdown

[01:52:35.450 --> 01:52:37.090]
Including George, who's going to be very upset

[01:52:37.090 --> 01:52:39.770]
I don't know, maybe I can bait you out with a really strong September

[01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:40.450]
Let's hope

[01:52:41.730 --> 01:52:47.190]
And of course the real, the 3 hours that people are really going to be examining here with a microscope

[01:52:47.190 --> 01:52:49.550]
With a very, very fine tooth comb

[01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:51.350]
Are going to be 6 to 9 a.m.

[01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:52.150]
Am I right about that?

[01:52:52.370 --> 01:52:53.510]
Absolutely, correct

[01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:55.450]
I could be wrong, it could just be making that up

[01:52:55.450 --> 01:52:57.790]
I think that between 6 to 9 a.m.

[01:52:57.930 --> 01:53:00.210]
They're going to be really, look at all this stuff

[01:53:00.210 --> 01:53:02.270]
The history of Boston, oh yeah

[01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:04.470]
W-I-L-D in Boston, forget about that

[01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:06.110]
Well, that's not going to go on our list

[01:53:07.110 --> 01:53:08.210]
Yeah, we got the list closed

[01:53:08.210 --> 01:53:09.890]
Is it on there yet? Are there votes coming in?

[01:53:09.930 --> 01:53:11.310]
Is he got it up or what? I don't know

[01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:13.130]
Because I don't want to get off of this thing here

[01:53:13.850 --> 01:53:15.570]
Because then I have to go back and put it on there

[01:53:15.570 --> 01:53:16.790]
I'm going to go through all of that

[01:53:18.690 --> 01:53:19.970]
Open another window

[01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:22.730]
Open another window, just hit your browser again

[01:53:22.730 --> 01:53:26.050]
I don't want to open up another window

[01:53:26.050 --> 01:53:29.910]
Because you don't understand, I've got this site on here

[01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:30.890]
And I've got the real player

[01:53:31.330 --> 01:53:32.490]
On top of it, okay

[01:53:32.490 --> 01:53:35.170]
I mean, I'm fairly relatively for an old fart

[01:53:35.170 --> 01:53:36.490]
I'm doing fairly good with this stuff

[01:53:36.490 --> 01:53:38.850]
But I'm not like some hot shot like Carlos

[01:53:38.850 --> 01:53:41.110]
You know what I'm saying? I'm not like that hot shot

[01:53:41.630 --> 01:53:43.430]
That thinks you know something about computers

[01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:44.990]
Does he really know anything about it or not?

[01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:46.870]
He's bringing all his certificates in

[01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:47.890]
Yeah

[01:53:49.370 --> 01:53:50.190]
Well, what is that?

[01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.730]
It's not up there

[01:53:51.170 --> 01:53:52.490]
No, he took a whole bunch of courses

[01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:54.250]
He's all certified with this and with that

[01:53:54.250 --> 01:53:56.450]
Oh yeah, like I said, let's make a trade-out

[01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:57.410]
Send him the fast train

[01:53:58.510 --> 01:53:59.690]
He's supposed to be the wizard

[01:54:00.570 --> 01:54:02.890]
Anyways, we had Arne Ginsburg a little bit of that good stuff

[01:54:02.890 --> 01:54:05.410]
Let me look on our list and see who else we ought to have on here

[01:54:06.150 --> 01:54:09.670]
We had jungle j... I bet you that guy never thought we'd have jungle jane else on there

[01:54:09.670 --> 01:54:11.250]
Even though it was a bad clip from Chum and Toronto

[01:54:11.790 --> 01:54:12.890]
Maybe he was like a little bit down

[01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:14.510]
Because you know back in those days especially

[01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:16.450]
In Toronto was a little more laid back

[01:54:17.970 --> 01:54:19.510]
Well, how's the radio Toronto now?

[01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:20.650]
No, I have no idea

[01:54:20.650 --> 01:54:22.370]
People ask me stuff like that

[01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:25.090]
Like I'm sitting there listening to the radio all day

[01:54:25.090 --> 01:54:26.550]
What do you know? I'm not

[01:54:27.090 --> 01:54:30.150]
The only time I've ever turned on my radio up there was uh

[01:54:30.150 --> 01:54:33.750]
When Joe Bowen in fact I taped it that the Leafs were playing in the playoffs last spring

[01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:36.690]
And I wanted to get him because the CBC is doing the games on TV

[01:54:36.690 --> 01:54:38.390]
And I wanted to get Joe Bowen's call

[01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:40.530]
That was the game that he just about went ape-smit

[01:54:40.530 --> 01:54:42.130]
When they went on overtime against the Arliners

[01:54:42.130 --> 01:54:43.110]
Oh there it is

[01:54:43.110 --> 01:54:44.850]
There is what? The poll is up

[01:54:44.850 --> 01:54:45.730]
And anybody?

[01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.790]
I'm going to vote for QAM

[01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:47.970]
Or you haven't uh...

[01:54:47.970 --> 01:54:48.330]
Ah

[01:54:49.290 --> 01:54:50.850]
Well I'm going to do it in here during a break

[01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:52.570]
Because I want to vote for a Keener 13

[01:54:52.570 --> 01:54:54.130]
Nobody would be able to be in or...

[01:54:54.130 --> 01:54:54.850]
Well that's right

[01:54:54.850 --> 01:54:55.530]
Go ahead

[01:54:55.530 --> 01:54:56.190]
Go ahead

[01:54:56.850 --> 01:55:00.370]
See obviously I mean this is the kind of a poll that the Miami Stations are going to have the advantage

[01:55:00.370 --> 01:55:02.670]
Because most of the people we got down here have been here all their lives

[01:55:02.670 --> 01:55:05.250]
Unfortunately we sent along our deep sympathies by the way

[01:55:05.250 --> 01:55:06.550]
Here are the preliminaries

[01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.950]
Yes?

[01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:08.190]
WQAM 7

[01:55:08.190 --> 01:55:09.310]
W ABC 6

[01:55:09.310 --> 01:55:10.150]
W K

[01:55:10.570 --> 01:55:10.930]
What?

[01:55:11.170 --> 01:55:11.390]
W

[01:55:13.290 --> 01:55:14.090]
KDKA 3

[01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:15.330]
W on us 2

[01:55:15.330 --> 01:55:18.430]
And then 1H4WFUNWCFL

[01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:19.490]
Where is it?

[01:55:20.650 --> 01:55:21.050]
CKLW

[01:55:21.050 --> 01:55:21.770]
CKLW

[01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:22.170]
WQAM

[01:55:22.170 --> 01:55:22.850]
KFI

[01:55:23.410 --> 01:55:23.610]
W

[01:55:24.010 --> 01:55:24.990]
They all have one

[01:55:25.590 --> 01:55:26.630]
How about Keener 13?

[01:55:26.650 --> 01:55:27.290]
But most have none

[01:55:27.290 --> 01:55:28.730]
28 votes

[01:55:28.730 --> 01:55:29.930]
Well yeah just went up on her

[01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:31.550]
What do you want? Just went up moments ago

[01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:35.150]
See it's a lot easier for me to just

[01:55:35.150 --> 01:55:38.090]
Long music CKLW

[01:55:38.090 --> 01:55:38.850]
Play the card

[01:55:38.850 --> 01:55:41.510]
As opposed to like yank and this thing around again

[01:55:42.130 --> 01:55:44.810]
Let's see and I already mentioned this before Jack Pellvino

[01:55:45.670 --> 01:55:48.030]
And who was the other guy that was on WBF in Rochester

[01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:48.990]
What that was his name?

[01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:49.670]
Tallion guy

[01:55:50.150 --> 01:55:51.770]
Jack Pellvino there's one of Tallion

[01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:54.130]
Nick Nixon

[01:55:54.130 --> 01:55:55.950]
He wasn't the Tallion guy but there was uh

[01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:58.270]
Nick Nixon WBBF the home of the busy bees

[01:55:58.270 --> 01:56:01.470]
Also WHEC mornings with Eddie Meefe for over 30 years

[01:56:01.470 --> 01:56:03.270]
Yeah poor Eddie Meefe you know where Eddie Meefe was from

[01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:04.770]
Cannon dig with New York

[01:56:04.770 --> 01:56:05.950]
Bet you didn't know that

[01:56:05.950 --> 01:56:06.170]
No

[01:56:06.170 --> 01:56:08.010]
What an education it'll show you Ronnyl

[01:56:08.010 --> 01:56:08.550]
Thank you

[01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:10.410]
We learned crap not that it's useful

[01:56:10.410 --> 01:56:12.110]
Where ever gonna really need to know this stuff

[01:56:12.110 --> 01:56:14.650]
But you know you can never know too much right

[01:56:14.650 --> 01:56:15.310]
Right

[01:56:15.310 --> 01:56:17.310]
You can never know too god damn much

[01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:19.690]
Anyway two things I'll tell you he was from

[01:56:19.690 --> 01:56:22.370]
Candidate when the New York he worked on WHEC

[01:56:22.370 --> 01:56:24.010]
Seeing Rochester and he's dead

[01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:27.090]
There you go there's the traffic to for you

[01:56:27.810 --> 01:56:29.990]
Man are you full of good useless information

[01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:32.490]
And not only that but what about tugboid and uh

[01:56:32.490 --> 01:56:35.290]
And Alex Winger at Suffolk Downs

[01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:39.550]
20 till noon at five and uh Bobby Huntress

[01:56:40.410 --> 01:56:41.390]
And B Farmer

[01:56:42.250 --> 01:56:43.310]
In June weller

[01:56:43.770 --> 01:56:44.850]
Hey if you're looking at the mirror

[01:56:44.850 --> 01:56:47.730]
Wonder where the hell out here went did it just like fly away or something

[01:56:47.730 --> 01:56:49.150]
I didn't I fell out

[01:56:49.150 --> 01:56:50.690]
Went in doubt it just falls out because

[01:56:50.690 --> 01:56:53.530]
God works in mysterious ways and he likes to punish most of us guys

[01:56:53.530 --> 01:56:56.770]
With a big ugly bald spot which sometimes comes very early in life

[01:56:56.770 --> 01:56:58.210]
And you don't feel too good about it

[01:56:58.210 --> 01:56:59.770]
You wish you had a nice full head of hair

[01:56:59.770 --> 01:57:03.110]
So the choices yours you can look either like Jerry Wichner in that picture

[01:57:03.110 --> 01:57:05.170]
I shouldn't say that because he's also still dead

[01:57:05.170 --> 01:57:06.950]
But so he doesn't care anymore right

[01:57:07.870 --> 01:57:10.710]
He's probably zoomin right up the old Ho Chi Minh trail right now

[01:57:10.710 --> 01:57:12.030]
Delighted you're mentioning his name

[01:57:12.030 --> 01:57:14.810]
Passing all them general buddies up in the oh that's right they're not up there

[01:57:14.810 --> 01:57:18.830]
But anyway if you want to get your hair back to smart way to do it is with the natural hairline system

[01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:21.870]
For my close personal buddy Chuck Alfie Erie and Ford Lauderdale because

[01:57:21.870 --> 01:57:24.630]
For over for a long time for a coon's age

[01:57:24.630 --> 01:57:27.550]
He's been helping guys look their best. There's nothing that looks better

[01:57:27.550 --> 01:57:30.010]
It looks real like real hair like it's grown out of your scalp

[01:57:30.010 --> 01:57:32.310]
Not like some grotesque horrendous thing

[01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:34.290]
That crawled up onto the top of your head and died

[01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:36.350]
Or like some smelly uh

[01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:38.270]
You know that that thing with that K-meer bouquet

[01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:39.970]
He's got to stop powdering his wigs

[01:57:39.970 --> 01:57:43.190]
Tell him that went out with god damn Tom Payne and Tom Jefferson and George Washington

[01:57:43.190 --> 01:57:45.390]
Tell him that next time you speak to him

[01:57:45.390 --> 01:57:45.730]
Okay

[01:57:45.730 --> 01:57:48.190]
And of course if you mention the Arranges when you call the Alfie Erie Studios

[01:57:48.190 --> 01:57:50.390]
You get $200 off the already low price

[01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:54.390]
So for just a pittance you guys can look better and younger than you ever probably thought you'd look again

[01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:56.050]
And there's no obligation at all

[01:57:56.050 --> 01:57:58.790]
They'll be more in happy to give you a free uh an appointment for a free consultation

[01:57:58.790 --> 01:58:01.530]
They'll sit down your ugly ass and show you just how much better

[01:58:01.530 --> 01:58:03.130]
How sensationly it can make you look

[01:58:03.130 --> 01:58:06.350]
And you got nothing loose but the ball spot because it's completely guaranteed

[01:58:06.350 --> 01:58:08.670]
If you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells

[01:58:08.670 --> 01:58:10.690]
If you're not getting laid multiple times today

[01:58:10.690 --> 01:58:12.010]
Return it for a full refund

[01:58:12.010 --> 01:58:14.270]
Make the call today and lose that ugly ball spot

[01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:19.350]
Call 1-800-321-2413-183-21-2413

[01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:20.550]
Or log on to

[01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:21.750]
Well look at that speed

[01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:23.970]
Look at that as soon as I said ball spot the beast walked in

[01:58:23.970 --> 01:58:26.250]
But I hope the coast is clear I hope mulled right here

[01:58:26.690 --> 01:58:28.190]
Charles Alfie Erie.com

[01:58:28.190 --> 01:58:28.690]
So

[01:58:30.850 --> 01:58:32.510]
chair

[01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:33.370]
Chewe

[01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:48.790]
Joey's days are done

[01:58:50.730 --> 01:58:52.790]
Joys days are done.

[01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:57.150]
Bill Marshall is his son.

[01:58:58.030 --> 01:59:01.230]
The show just ain't no fun.

[01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:08.790]
So what does Carey Bruce think Joey is gonna do?

[01:59:10.530 --> 01:59:12.790]
He tried to smile and we can get it.

[01:59:13.330 --> 01:59:15.590]
And now we're crying on his pain.

[01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:21.090]
The ratings are reflected.

[01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:23.130]
No way to read the record.

[01:59:23.610 --> 01:59:25.150]
He got it all across the way.

[01:59:25.770 --> 01:59:26.130]
Yeah.

[01:59:30.410 --> 01:59:32.310]
Joey's got a gun.

[01:59:34.590 --> 01:59:36.550]
Joey's got a gun.

[01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:40.710]
Neil can't help this one.

[01:59:41.970 --> 01:59:45.150]
Maybe you days are done.

[01:59:45.150 --> 01:59:48.710]
What is he gonna do?

[01:59:50.090 --> 01:59:52.710]
Is waitio days are through.

[01:59:54.370 --> 01:59:56.910]
He tried to smile and we can get it.

[01:59:57.090 --> 01:59:59.290]
And now we're crying on his pain.

[02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:04.630]
The ratings are reflected.

[02:00:05.090 --> 02:00:06.610]
No way to read the record.

[02:00:06.610 --> 02:00:10.010]
Does he have a crawl away in shame?

[02:00:13.670 --> 02:00:14.470]
Run away.

[02:00:15.610 --> 02:00:18.250]
Run away from the pain.

[02:00:21.130 --> 02:00:23.090]
Run away.

[02:00:23.790 --> 02:00:26.550]
Run away from the pain.

[02:00:27.150 --> 02:00:27.150]

[02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:32.870]
I am that him right.

[02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:36.550]
W.

[02:00:37.870 --> 02:00:38.550]
Hey.

[02:00:39.570 --> 02:00:40.250]
B.

[02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:42.070]
W.

[02:00:43.010 --> 02:00:43.610]
C.

[02:00:44.210 --> 02:00:48.330]
And 715 at 47 degrees in Buffalo.

[02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:53.050]
This is John Zach reporting for the original Richard Wild Irish Rose.

[02:00:53.130 --> 02:00:55.490]
Cadet Baker Industries, Cadet Baker, New York.

[02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:58.670]
The official KDU weather eye forecast for this hour.

[02:00:58.790 --> 02:01:01.230]
Clear and surely tonight with a low in the mid 30s cooler.

[02:01:01.230 --> 02:01:03.970]
It's got her frost or freeze in some inland areas.

[02:01:04.210 --> 02:01:05.570]
Generally fair and warm in the mouth.

[02:01:05.710 --> 02:01:08.130]
By the way, speaking of Canada, your industry is Canada, New York.

[02:01:08.150 --> 02:01:08.990]
There was a winery.

[02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:11.670]
Probably the biggest industry in town.

[02:01:11.670 --> 02:01:13.090]
And a little time that I went to high school.

[02:01:13.590 --> 02:01:15.350]
And it was owned by Howard Samuel.

[02:01:15.490 --> 02:01:16.710]
So it was a professional candidate.

[02:01:16.710 --> 02:01:18.410]
He was kind of like Bob Coons, the Ellis Ruben.

[02:01:18.750 --> 02:01:20.070]
Always running for governor, running for this.

[02:01:20.330 --> 02:01:21.630]
And his son was named Bill Samuel.

[02:01:21.630 --> 02:01:22.810]
So he was a year behind me in school.

[02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:25.790]
And I should point out he's a real asshole.

[02:01:27.410 --> 02:01:28.210]
Can I say that?

[02:01:28.590 --> 02:01:29.210]
Oh, and look at this.

[02:01:29.370 --> 02:01:30.750]
I screwed up the Joey thing now.

[02:01:30.930 --> 02:01:31.610]
Oh, no.

[02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:33.570]
How did I do that?

[02:01:35.450 --> 02:01:37.270]
Is this going to resume or not, you think?

[02:01:39.690 --> 02:01:40.410]
Oh, no.

[02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:45.050]
I know how to do it.

[02:01:45.070 --> 02:01:45.550]
Just relax.

[02:01:46.110 --> 02:01:46.850]
Just calm down.

[02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.950]
Why did I do that?

[02:01:49.230 --> 02:01:50.670]
Because I could stop it.

[02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:52.050]
But now I'm trying to like start it again.

[02:01:52.090 --> 02:01:55.010]
That's going to be bad if we can't get joy on again.

[02:01:55.010 --> 02:01:56.570]
I have my nose up, Meele's ass.

[02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:56.910]
Right.

[02:01:58.270 --> 02:02:01.010]
It's worth it, you know, any of the things is how he or finds the...

[02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.650]
W.

[02:02:03.330 --> 02:02:04.930]
Oh, please, you.

[02:02:05.590 --> 02:02:06.030]
Ah!

[02:02:06.250 --> 02:02:07.030]
It's 7.15.

[02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:08.930]
It's 47 degrees in Buffalo.

[02:02:09.450 --> 02:02:11.410]
This is John Zach reporting for...

[02:02:11.410 --> 02:02:13.650]
How many times do you know Rick and O'Ritchard's Wild Irish Rose?

[02:02:13.810 --> 02:02:16.110]
Cadet Lake, where industries, Cadet Lake, where New York.

[02:02:16.530 --> 02:02:19.350]

Here's Joey Reynolds.

[02:03:11.130 --> 02:03:11.850]
Hello.

[02:03:12.450 --> 02:03:16.270]
What kind of book would you recommend for a decimal?

[02:03:17.050 --> 02:03:17.850]
A cellar.

[02:03:20.850 --> 02:03:21.570]
Stupid.

[02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:23.650]
You got him, all.

[02:03:30.590 --> 02:03:31.250]
Come on, Joey.

[02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.710]
Here's some.

[02:03:35.710 --> 02:03:37.470]
I see in front of my rams in Louison.

[02:03:37.570 --> 02:03:38.010]
Nobody came in.

[02:03:38.050 --> 02:03:38.970]
I'll do 21 after seven.

[02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:40.130]
I went and got the radio.

[02:03:40.130 --> 02:03:41.150]
We're going to do the change over yet.

[02:03:41.610 --> 02:03:43.290]
Danny has to go to the premiere tonight, right?

[02:03:43.730 --> 02:03:44.810]
The premiere of the Great Race.

[02:03:45.190 --> 02:03:45.910]
Is he going with you, Fred?

[02:03:46.130 --> 02:03:46.610]
Great class team.

[02:03:46.710 --> 02:03:47.570]
Danny, there's going to be there tonight.

[02:03:47.930 --> 02:03:48.250]
What time?

[02:03:49.130 --> 02:03:49.830]
Five minutes ago?

[02:03:50.090 --> 02:03:50.430]
That's nice.

[02:03:50.670 --> 02:03:50.890]
All right.

[02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:53.170]
That's where it went.

[02:03:53.610 --> 02:03:55.970]
One time with a new song from Final Joe.

[02:04:00.890 --> 02:04:03.330]
Things for battle with Coca-Cola.

[02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:05.770]
Coca-Cola.

[02:04:05.770 --> 02:04:07.690]
Things for battle with Coke.

[02:04:09.490 --> 02:04:12.890]
Nothing much for a radio to praise.

[02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:15.970]
Who and talker?

[02:04:16.330 --> 02:04:17.550]
Who refreshes you fast?

[02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:20.310]
Say I can do the post right now.

[02:04:20.370 --> 02:04:21.630]
Somebody get in the way.

[02:04:22.110 --> 02:04:23.610]
Who's the battle with?

[02:04:24.630 --> 02:04:26.110]
Final battle with?

[02:04:27.370 --> 02:04:28.970]
Who's the battle with?

[02:04:28.970 --> 02:04:29.950]
Who's the battle with?

[02:04:30.330 --> 02:04:32.410]
Who's the battle with?

[02:04:32.410 --> 02:04:33.530]
Who's the real I want?

[02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:36.050]
The worst sex to find?

[02:04:36.730 --> 02:04:38.010]
Who's the real you?

[02:04:38.830 --> 02:04:41.110]
And everything you do?

[02:04:44.250 --> 02:04:46.390]
Who's the battle with?

[02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:47.430]
Coca-Cola.

[02:04:48.910 --> 02:04:50.270]
Things for battle with?

[02:04:50.910 --> 02:04:53.790]
Freddie Colisein is being unfair in the mayor of KB Country Campaign.

[02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:56.010]
Stan Roberts had a recording announcement.

[02:04:56.590 --> 02:04:58.650]
And according to the rules of the game, according to our memo here,

[02:04:58.730 --> 02:05:00.270]
it says you must make a 30-second speech.

[02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:02.090]
Stan Roberts tried to slip in a minute speech.

[02:05:02.710 --> 02:05:04.790]
Freddie cut it off after half a minute.

[02:05:05.770 --> 02:05:06.770]
Freddie's really off to win, Freddie.

[02:05:06.850 --> 02:05:07.990]
He's got the oldest campaign speech.

[02:05:09.290 --> 02:05:13.410]
Man, you know something he was just as bad then as he is now.

[02:05:13.950 --> 02:05:14.750]
Same material, too.

[02:05:14.970 --> 02:05:15.710]
Good, God.

[02:05:15.710 --> 02:05:16.330]
Stupid.

[02:05:16.510 --> 02:05:16.710]
Yeah.

[02:05:17.490 --> 02:05:19.630]
But anyway, where did you get this?

[02:05:19.730 --> 02:05:20.630]
Did somebody fax this in?

[02:05:20.810 --> 02:05:21.010]
I guess.

[02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.350]
Yes.

[02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:23.490]
A photo of Joy from 1960.

[02:05:23.650 --> 02:05:25.730]
Early 60s, that air check was from 65.

[02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:26.770]
It was from a hunger as well.

[02:05:27.370 --> 02:05:30.230]
And man, I've forgotten how fat he was.

[02:05:30.370 --> 02:05:31.070]
He was gigantic.

[02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:33.330]
And he went from one extreme to the other.

[02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:34.530]
Then he became a scrawny.

[02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:35.990]
I mean, really scrawny.

[02:05:36.130 --> 02:05:37.030]
With a lot of loose skin.

[02:05:39.390 --> 02:05:40.870]
Well, when he gets to be that age,

[02:05:41.090 --> 02:05:41.890]
you have a lot of loose skin.

[02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:43.070]
That's what Motorola made this morning.

[02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:45.250]
He said, too loose last skin.

[02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:48.850]
But anyway, this is the photo for February 2000,

[02:05:48.970 --> 02:05:50.970]
a counter used by Buffalo broadcast pioneers.

[02:05:51.450 --> 02:05:52.430]
Oh, they have a website.

[02:05:52.530 --> 02:05:53.810]
Man, there's more goddamn websites.

[02:05:54.370 --> 02:05:56.290]
We could milk this thing for like about five years.

[02:05:56.510 --> 02:05:58.250]
If I was going to be here that long, which I won't.

[02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:59.610]
That sounds good to me.

[02:05:59.950 --> 02:06:01.310]
Here's Bill from Boca says.

[02:06:02.090 --> 02:06:04.390]
I grew up on Miami Beach during the 50s and 60s.

[02:06:04.450 --> 02:06:05.810]
Oh, yeah, I'm glad you reminded me to play chicken.

[02:06:05.810 --> 02:06:06.450]
Now I will, Bill.

[02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:09.190]
Beach, I graduate 67.

[02:06:09.870 --> 02:06:11.290]
Your show today is one of your best.

[02:06:11.290 --> 02:06:13.430]
And you are absolutely correct.

[02:06:13.650 --> 02:06:15.230]
Well, clips from QM and F you want to give me.

[02:06:15.330 --> 02:06:16.270]
Now, stales are overload.

[02:06:16.410 --> 02:06:17.390]
When you say Roby Young, Harvey,

[02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:18.410]
you have to say the big Kahuna.

[02:06:18.710 --> 02:06:20.210]
Well, we used to have to say that when he was alive.

[02:06:20.210 --> 02:06:22.050]
But now that he's dead, it don't make no difference.

[02:06:22.890 --> 02:06:24.990]
I guess we should play that Roby Young thing on the ear, huh?

[02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:26.250]
That's one of my favorites.

[02:06:28.570 --> 02:06:29.210]
Oh, God.

[02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:31.010]
What is it under?

[02:06:31.010 --> 02:06:31.610]
Is it under Roby?

[02:06:31.710 --> 02:06:32.250]
Roby Rants.

[02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:32.750]
Oh, yeah.

[02:06:33.070 --> 02:06:33.870]
No, it's under doomed.

[02:06:35.150 --> 02:06:35.850]
Roby Young doomed.

[02:06:36.450 --> 02:06:36.550]
Oh.

[02:06:37.230 --> 02:06:39.670]
Anyway, when I went to Nautilus Jr. High School, says Bill,

[02:06:39.670 --> 02:06:42.370]
we'd walked past the QM Studio in Arthur Godfrey Road.

[02:06:43.070 --> 02:06:45.470]
After buying the latest comic books of the direct story next door,

[02:06:45.610 --> 02:06:48.030]
Greenlander and the Flash Batman, all for ten cents,

[02:06:48.250 --> 02:06:50.530]
I could have returned already if I didn't throw those comic books out.

[02:06:50.530 --> 02:06:51.170]
So I'll say, Bill, you're right.

[02:06:51.650 --> 02:06:52.950]
Please, please play chicken man.

[02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:53.850]
He says, and we will.

[02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.390]
But first.

[02:06:54.690 --> 02:06:55.470]
You people are said,

[02:06:55.930 --> 02:06:59.530]
so damn bad did not know you have to be brought up by that bandit faction.

[02:06:59.950 --> 02:07:02.270]
But if I wanted to buy some time on your station,

[02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:03.290]
I couldn't.

[02:07:03.370 --> 02:07:04.470]
You don't have real people.

[02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:06.450]
That's 75, yeah, for it.

[02:07:06.590 --> 02:07:08.070]
You don't have it on your regular number.

[02:07:08.070 --> 02:07:10.690]
I was asked to be a guest on one of your talk shows,

[02:07:10.930 --> 02:07:12.070]
or I think it's your AM, the WROD.

[02:07:12.990 --> 02:07:15.710]
They won't even call me back to tell me what the name of the show is.

[02:07:16.130 --> 02:07:18.070]
My work on your station in 1964,

[02:07:19.210 --> 02:07:21.470]
I was sort of prominent guy in Miami.

[02:07:21.890 --> 02:07:24.590]
That by time, and I influenced people by time.

[02:07:25.010 --> 02:07:27.710]
If you people can't get it together to be a better radio station,

[02:07:28.290 --> 02:07:31.250]
then if you were at the Honolead station or an UBS station,

[02:07:31.870 --> 02:07:33.830]
I suggest that you take a damn frequency,

[02:07:34.130 --> 02:07:37.070]
which my grandmother's friend Jesse J put on the air in 1926,

[02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:40.870]
that you turn the damn thing off and get out of the business.

[02:07:41.170 --> 02:07:43.050]
You people ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

[02:07:43.410 --> 02:07:44.450]
My name is Robbie Young,

[02:07:44.970 --> 02:07:47.790]
and the telephone number is a motel in Miami.

[02:07:47.970 --> 02:07:48.710]
Room 13.

[02:07:49.170 --> 02:07:51.230]
You people ought to be ashamed.

[02:07:51.850 --> 02:07:53.530]
You shouldn't even be running that facility.

[02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:57.890]
And I used to be the boss of the damn thing in 19...

[02:07:57.890 --> 02:08:00.050]
I ran the damn thing and I was flying around.

[02:08:00.630 --> 02:08:01.110]
You are terrible.

[02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:02.370]
You are terrible.

[02:08:02.570 --> 02:08:02.570]

[02:08:02.850 --> 02:08:04.290]
You have no credit for the radio.

[02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:07.090]
Now, I damn it all to death before I get on the phone.

[02:08:07.790 --> 02:08:09.190]
You get on the phone to me.

[02:08:09.450 --> 02:08:10.970]
You get me to take this back.

[02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:12.190]
I'm a terrible one.

[02:08:12.770 --> 02:08:14.070]
Just as they'll go through.

[02:08:14.210 --> 02:08:15.930]
But it will be because you're doing anyhow.

[02:08:16.250 --> 02:08:17.070]
Little bacteria.

[02:08:17.570 --> 02:08:18.510]
Good luck to you, Robbie,

[02:08:18.910 --> 02:08:20.670]
and that big broadcast booth in the sky.

[02:08:21.390 --> 02:08:22.810]
Well, she's floating right up there somewhere,

[02:08:23.010 --> 02:08:24.290]
or you're into that, in purgatory.

[02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:26.970]
Robbie Young, he'd be the best baby, the big hona.

[02:08:27.190 --> 02:08:28.230]
I can't find chicken man.

[02:08:28.250 --> 02:08:29.870]
It's very depressing, and you want to know why?

[02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.170]
Why?

[02:08:30.370 --> 02:08:32.510]
Because it's not something you can type in on the search

[02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:33.370]
and find it on there.

[02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:35.630]
So it was at the bottom of one of the pages,

[02:08:35.630 --> 02:08:38.830]
and since there's only about 45,000 pages on his website,

[02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:40.250]
what I'll have to do is tonight at home,

[02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:41.270]
because I don't have time to do it now.

[02:08:41.590 --> 02:08:43.070]
I'll have to, like, dig a little around and find it,

[02:08:43.210 --> 02:08:44.590]
and the chicken man thing too.

[02:08:46.290 --> 02:08:47.010]
It's worth playing.

[02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:48.770]
But we won't find you having to look for it.

[02:08:48.810 --> 02:08:49.810]
We had that in Kalamazoo.

[02:08:49.930 --> 02:08:50.410]
Oh, that's right.

[02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:52.010]
I won't have a lot of fun looking for it.

[02:08:52.610 --> 02:08:54.370]
We had that in Kalamazoo at WTPS.

[02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:55.490]
Is that on our list?

[02:08:55.690 --> 02:08:55.850]
No.

[02:08:55.970 --> 02:08:56.110]
No.

[02:08:56.250 --> 02:08:57.150]
What's the great station, though?

[02:08:57.650 --> 02:08:58.230]
For a while.

[02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:59.070]
For about five minutes.

[02:09:00.370 --> 02:09:02.590]
Four minutes, till noon here at 560 WTQ.

[02:09:02.670 --> 02:09:03.250]
I'll tell you one thing.

[02:09:03.250 --> 02:09:05.110]
This show is, it's like getting away from us.

[02:09:05.110 --> 02:09:05.990]
It's so fast today.

[02:09:06.670 --> 02:09:07.690]
And you want to know why?

[02:09:08.170 --> 02:09:10.110]
Okay, so the North Koreans, they're working on nukes.

[02:09:10.170 --> 02:09:10.790]
We already knew that.

[02:09:11.150 --> 02:09:12.650]
They still haven't found a guy named Sniper.

[02:09:13.370 --> 02:09:16.030]
This, uh, this, uh, Earnhardt.

[02:09:16.030 --> 02:09:17.630]
He got convicted of murdering his wife.

[02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:18.650]
What else?

[02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:20.430]
President is still, uh,

[02:09:20.630 --> 02:09:21.950]
Malimoran can make him sounds like that.

[02:09:22.250 --> 02:09:23.950]
So you have bushes still talking about bull dikes,

[02:09:24.050 --> 02:09:24.810]
and that's it.

[02:09:25.730 --> 02:09:28.010]
So let's have a little diversion and perversion here,

[02:09:28.030 --> 02:09:29.990]
especially as we await that big moment,

[02:09:30.150 --> 02:09:32.090]
1130 on Monday morning when the book comes out.

[02:09:32.570 --> 02:09:32.970]
Woo!

[02:09:33.230 --> 02:09:33.510]
Baby!

[02:09:33.870 --> 02:09:34.190]
That man!

[02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:36.050]
Just bring a, bring a nose pin.

[02:09:36.410 --> 02:09:38.050]
Put on the end of your nose when those numbers come out.

[02:09:38.290 --> 02:09:39.110]
Could be a real disaster.

[02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:40.290]
Lots of summer book, you know.

[02:09:40.750 --> 02:09:42.010]
That's always a good rationalization.

[02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:44.490]
Hey, pizza loft is going strong in their new location.

[02:09:44.930 --> 02:09:46.550]
In fact, I'm going to have to take my good friend Marcy

[02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:48.970]
from Walgreens, there for lunch to pass a fire her very soon.

[02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:50.310]
Just calm down, Marcy.

[02:09:50.430 --> 02:09:51.390]
I'll get to you, okay, sweetheart?

[02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:53.670]
Just give me a couple of minutes to catch my breath.

[02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:56.450]
But at any rate, it's on knob, hill, and sunrise.

[02:09:56.450 --> 02:09:59.490]
Right behind Walgreens, in fact, Marcy can look out the drive-in window there

[02:09:59.490 --> 02:10:02.510]
at the pharmaceutical thing, and then look right at it.

[02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:04.470]
And she's probably doing that every day,

[02:10:04.570 --> 02:10:06.610]
saying, I wonder when that fat old Jew is going to come by

[02:10:06.610 --> 02:10:08.830]
and take me for my nice, free lunch at pizza loft.

[02:10:09.110 --> 02:10:09.870]
Very soon, Marcy.

[02:10:10.270 --> 02:10:10.670]
Very soon.

[02:10:11.050 --> 02:10:12.450]
And you ought to get by there very soon, too,

[02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:13.810]
because the food is fresh and delicious.

[02:10:14.210 --> 02:10:16.750]
The same quality of come to love, and no one expect as the

[02:10:16.750 --> 02:10:18.150]
original pizza loft stores.

[02:10:18.590 --> 02:10:19.950]
And let me give both numbers out.

[02:10:20.610 --> 02:10:22.970]
If you want to take out delivery catering in the University

[02:10:22.970 --> 02:10:25.290]
driving a daily location right by Steve Amazouc,

[02:10:25.590 --> 02:10:27.510]
that number is 954-916-8880.

[02:10:29.130 --> 02:10:30.970]
954-916-8880 is a matter of fact.

[02:10:30.970 --> 02:10:32.910]
Jeff Cohen is probably one of Steve Amazouc's customers,

[02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:34.930]
too, wouldn't surprise me, because you know him,

[02:10:34.930 --> 02:10:36.110]
he's a real party guy.

[02:10:36.610 --> 02:10:38.410]
And in the new location there in plantation,

[02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:40.970]
you can call 954-382-1999.

[02:10:42.550 --> 02:10:43.270]
382-1999.

[02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:45.370]
We don't want to overlook that daily location.

[02:10:45.370 --> 02:10:48.250]
It's on University, between Griffin and 595, right behind Pier 1 imports

[02:10:48.250 --> 02:10:50.830]
with a crap load of free parking for you, right kitty corner of the

[02:10:50.830 --> 02:10:51.350]
air-men in a low cafe.

[02:10:51.870 --> 02:10:54.230]
And the newest one, like I said, is right on the corner knob, hill, and sunrise,

[02:10:54.490 --> 02:10:56.450]
in the little strip shopping center behind Walgreens.

[02:10:56.850 --> 02:10:58.790]
Fresh, delicious, big portions, cheap prices,

[02:10:58.790 --> 02:11:01.750]
three different kinds of great pizza, the best garlic rolls you ever popped in your

[02:11:01.750 --> 02:11:02.190]
outpuss.

[02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:04.970]
It's the best in the universe, it's the world famous pizza law.

[02:11:05.170 --> 02:11:09.830]
Fly in and local, your sports radio 560's, you a-

[02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:10.930]
you a-

[02:11:12.510 --> 02:11:14.570]
Oh, me, Mr. Boots.

[02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:17.470]
And I've been with him, and I do the dwell the one and hour.

[02:11:18.030 --> 02:11:22.330]
Hi, I'm Joey D, formally of Joey D in the starlight.

[02:11:22.670 --> 02:11:25.350]
I'm also founder of the Rock n Roll restaurant,

[02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:29.730]
where we provide care and treatment for many of the Rock n Roll stars.

[02:11:30.250 --> 02:11:35.490]
You love so much in the past, but whose lives have been destroyed by crooked record companies.

[02:11:36.070 --> 02:11:38.890]
Stars, like Mr. D. Klark over here.

[02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:55.650]
You can plainly see why we need your help.

[02:11:56.070 --> 02:12:00.390]
Over here we have Danny Lupitas, who's staying rhythm for the govones.

[02:12:00.970 --> 02:12:03.210]
Every now and then I try to help them out.

[02:12:03.690 --> 02:12:04.850]
It's okay, Danny.

[02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:08.410]
I will help you.

[02:12:13.570 --> 02:12:20.530]
Please show your support by sending your checks to 442 Glenwood Avenue in Surf City.

[02:12:21.010 --> 02:12:24.170]

For more information, just call Beechwood45789.

[02:12:30.190 --> 02:12:30.690]
Thank you.

[02:12:33.090 --> 02:12:33.690]
You're welcome.

[02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:34.730]
This one's going to have a gap.

[02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:37.190]
It's 1203 at 560 QAM.

[02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:39.190]
But any second, Larry Lujak is going to be on.

[02:12:39.590 --> 02:12:39.890]
Any second.

[02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:45.750]
Larry, on your program since I identified you as the top Rock n Roll DJ.

[02:12:46.710 --> 02:12:48.570]
Do you play the top four top image top?

[02:12:48.610 --> 02:12:49.310]
I understand.

[02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:55.230]
Do you play the top 40 or do you pick your owner as a four mad and four you or how does that work?

[02:12:55.490 --> 02:12:57.710]
No, it's about the top five here every 10 minutes.

[02:12:57.710 --> 02:12:59.050]
No, it's...

[02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:02.290]
Are you just funny on the radio?

[02:13:02.370 --> 02:13:03.730]
Oh, I'm hysterical, best.

[02:13:03.850 --> 02:13:06.790]
John Lennon, the amateur Theologian in his game.

[02:13:08.150 --> 02:13:09.710]
DJR Classic 741.

[02:13:09.870 --> 02:13:14.770]
Be sure you're listening tomorrow for Chuck Bowling's football predictions of the college games going up this weekend.

[02:13:15.110 --> 02:13:17.710]
And hopefully at tomorrow night of my program, I start a new service.

[02:13:18.230 --> 02:13:22.210]
I'm going to start predicting the outcome of the fights after the high school games.

[02:13:23.610 --> 02:13:24.550]
Really, I am.

[02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:26.250]
From the big 89.

[02:13:27.130 --> 02:13:30.010]
Larry Lujak plays more hip music.

[02:13:31.450 --> 02:13:33.850]
To 12, Larry Lujak, a WLS.

[02:13:34.010 --> 02:13:37.370]
So boy gang, it's cow joke time again here at the beginning night.

[02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:40.090]
You know what happens if they cow the drank ink?

[02:13:40.970 --> 02:13:42.450]
She moved in the go.

[02:13:43.070 --> 02:13:44.830]
Gosh, that's funny, I'm laughing so hard.

[02:13:44.910 --> 02:13:46.190]
I'll have to stop for a minute here.

[02:13:46.670 --> 02:13:48.270]
Say symbolic confusion.

[02:13:48.450 --> 02:13:51.670]
The temptation's 2.32 with Larry Lujak, a WLS.

[02:13:51.670 --> 02:13:54.830]
The Chicago's Oscar-Mayer plan is under pressure within one hour.

[02:13:55.290 --> 02:14:00.470]
The Oscar-Mayer people have got to come up with 36,000 winners just to keep Chicago happy.

[02:14:00.730 --> 02:14:03.850]
Because you have elected the Oscar-Mayer All-Meet Weiner number one in Chicago.

[02:14:04.510 --> 02:14:08.150]
Everybody loves this mild yet tasty All-Meet Weiner.

[02:14:08.910 --> 02:14:11.810]
It's number one at Riggly Field number one at Summer Picnic Sky.

[02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:13.630]
It's just a swell Weiner.

[02:14:14.230 --> 02:14:16.530]
It's fun to put it near mouth and bite down on it.

[02:14:17.010 --> 02:14:18.470]
And number one at the tables of Chicago.

[02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:19.470]
Will they make it?

[02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:22.610]
Oscar-Mayer come up with enough All-Meet Weiner to satisfy Chicago?

[02:14:23.210 --> 02:14:23.890]
Yeah, man.

[02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:31.790]
The deadline for having 1971 license plates on is only a little over a month away midnight Monday, February 15.

[02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:42.810]
And if you plan to apply for your place by mail, application should be at the Secretary of State's Office in Springfield no later than January 25th.

[02:14:42.810 --> 02:14:47.310]
Which is only 25.

[02:14:47.850 --> 02:14:49.090]
Take away 11.

[02:14:50.170 --> 02:14:51.850]
That's two weeks gang.

[02:14:52.490 --> 02:14:54.230]
Trying to allow for processing in delivery.

[02:14:54.910 --> 02:14:58.570]
Because I mail them off third class and that takes a little more time.

[02:14:58.730 --> 02:15:00.490]
From the base 89.

[02:15:03.410 --> 02:15:05.530]
A Larry Lujak Morning Show.

[02:15:05.770 --> 02:15:09.290]
W-A-L-S-E-C-C-D-O

[02:15:09.290 --> 02:15:17.350]
In a completely unrescited move, I have actually showed up for work on time today, leaving the entire audience stunned that a man is in gasping for breath.

[02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:20.450]
505, the Whitney City at WLS.

[02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:24.930]
It's called top 40, but at most major market stations anymore, it's not actually 40 records.

[02:15:25.090 --> 02:15:32.970]
They've cut the playlist back. It's pretty tight. It's usually about 25, 26 records with some oldies sprinkled in.

[02:15:32.970 --> 02:15:38.390]
But it's no longer a most top 40 stations are the way it originally started.

[02:15:38.510 --> 02:15:40.290]
The top 40 stations played the top 40 records.

[02:15:40.490 --> 02:15:44.910]
But most stations anymore have cut it back to about 20, 20 records.

[02:15:45.090 --> 02:15:47.910]
Is that frustrating for you? I mean sometimes you like to play something that you like?

[02:15:49.490 --> 02:15:54.910]
Yeah, well I'd like to get on and play nothing but whale and gennings and Mural Haggard.

[02:15:56.790 --> 02:16:00.730]
But, uh, ain't much money to play in whale and gennings and I'm angry.

[02:16:00.730 --> 02:16:03.930]
So, I play rock and roll.

[02:16:04.370 --> 02:16:06.110]
It's a writer and a detour to me.

[02:16:07.070 --> 02:16:08.690]
Sambo with a blues brass arm.

[02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:12.270]
I think it does his noise. He's smiling.

[02:16:13.070 --> 02:16:14.630]
And good call, he missed life.

[02:16:15.450 --> 02:16:18.410]
Taylor, Jay Progras, a well-or-gave habit, isn't he? Xamineer.

[02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:24.270]
You cannot call rock music, kid music anymore. It's not just kid music. Still kids like it.

[02:16:24.270 --> 02:16:29.970]
But, uh, a girl who was a 15-year-old high school sophomore, when Elvis came along with Heartbreak Hotel,

[02:16:29.970 --> 02:16:33.110]
is now 35 years old and a lot of them still like it.

[02:16:33.230 --> 02:16:36.370]
They like them loud guitars or mopping them floors.

[02:16:37.390 --> 02:16:38.790]
It's what you were brought up with.

[02:16:39.130 --> 02:16:41.130]
Yeah, I mean everybody gets to be 35.

[02:16:41.330 --> 02:16:46.310]
I'm only 23 myself. You just live hard, hard life.

[02:16:57.430 --> 02:17:00.730]
Elvis and Larry Lujac in Chicago, 515, a WLS.

[02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.990]
We stay together.

[02:17:03.210 --> 02:17:05.090]
Okay, we can do that without Tom Snyder.

[02:17:06.210 --> 02:17:10.350]
Great talent, Larry Lujac, a real asshole personally, but it goes to show it's just a radio show, sing.

[02:17:10.810 --> 02:17:12.350]
Just a radio show. You never really know.

[02:17:13.890 --> 02:17:16.030]
Well, we got a great list. How's that thing coming by the way?

[02:17:16.030 --> 02:17:18.790]
I guess I could click over and take a look for myself, which I will.

[02:17:18.990 --> 02:17:21.570]
I'll see 28 for WDQM. Well, that's an old brainer, okay?

[02:17:21.570 --> 02:17:24.350]
Because we got a lot of these soft photo people who lived here their whole lives.

[02:17:24.350 --> 02:17:27.690]
They think that's the best top 40 AM station that was ever on the air.

[02:17:27.810 --> 02:17:30.190]
And of course, like George, he thinks that was it.

[02:17:30.450 --> 02:17:33.710]
Catch me out. WABC 13, that's because of all in New Yorkers.

[02:17:33.790 --> 02:17:34.930]
Look at that WFU Wednesday.

[02:17:36.730 --> 02:17:39.550]
WLS, which we just had Larry Lujac on air is got a WAP.

[02:17:39.730 --> 02:17:41.510]
Oh, I need to remind me. I can do it tomorrow.

[02:17:41.610 --> 02:17:43.010]
But I better do it today. The grease man.

[02:17:43.410 --> 02:17:44.330]
Oh, yeah, on the big 8.

[02:17:44.710 --> 02:17:48.130]
Just mentioned Steve Nicola a couple times. We'll take a Jacksonville and Nicola bags.

[02:17:49.490 --> 02:17:52.870]
WAPE is got five WMCA. He's got five KDK AB having five.

[02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:55.330]
Whoa, whoa, he's got three WBZ three.

[02:17:55.630 --> 02:17:56.870]
It's just we're just getting this thing going.

[02:17:58.150 --> 02:18:01.170]
In fact, well, we'll see how long we want to leave this thing on here, you know?

[02:18:02.090 --> 02:18:03.290]
Because we're going to do this again tomorrow.

[02:18:03.530 --> 02:18:04.430]
Oh, not again, yeah.

[02:18:04.850 --> 02:18:09.410]
Now, the other one here, hypothesizing on Sienna is the sniper connected with Al-Qaeda.

[02:18:09.590 --> 02:18:12.770]
And I listened to about 30 seconds of the Wolf-Litzkrieg wrap on that.

[02:18:12.970 --> 02:18:14.950]
And the answer is they haven't got a freaking idea.

[02:18:15.930 --> 02:18:17.870]
They haven't got any idea who it is.

[02:18:18.270 --> 02:18:20.830]
Not until they get them and question them with a what towel over his head.

[02:18:20.930 --> 02:18:24.550]
Exactly. Well, maybe he's already got a towel over his head, but I don't know if it's wet or not.

[02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:28.970]
Nine minutes after noon at 5.60 WDQAM.

[02:18:30.370 --> 02:18:32.670]
Don't let me forget grease man. I think we'll do that next.

[02:18:33.690 --> 02:18:34.490]
WAPE the big 8.

[02:18:35.370 --> 02:18:41.690]
Or the great 8. You know, there's never been a better time to buy yourself a new home or refinancy resisting home then right now as I speak.

[02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:45.850]

You're way too late.

Thank you.

[02:19:42.310 --> 02:19:43.570]
Thank you.

[02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:47.030]
Thank you.

[02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.030]

[02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.230]
Thank you.

[02:19:50.930 --> 02:19:52.590]
Thank you.

[02:19:52.590 --> 02:19:53.210]
Thank you.

[02:19:53.790 --> 02:19:55.050]
Thank you.

[02:20:07.250 --> 02:20:09.770]
Thank you.

[02:20:09.770 --> 02:20:10.490]
Yes, Mom?

[02:20:10.730 --> 02:20:13.890]
Are you having that not so fresh feeling?

[02:20:14.490 --> 02:20:15.570]
How'd you know?

[02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:17.290]
Mom's know these things.

[02:20:18.990 --> 02:20:19.710]
Hello?

[02:20:20.970 --> 02:20:21.830]
It's you.

[02:20:22.090 --> 02:20:24.710]
Mom, who's that?

[02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:27.810]
It's Delegrease, Mom.

[02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:29.950]
What's she doing?

[02:20:30.570 --> 02:20:31.730]
I got a scream.

[02:20:32.330 --> 02:20:33.610]
Not so fresh feeling.

[02:20:33.610 --> 02:20:38.130]
I can't breathe.

[02:20:38.310 --> 02:20:40.930]
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Mom.

[02:20:41.090 --> 02:20:41.850]
What's she doing?

[02:20:42.450 --> 02:20:43.270]
Make her stop.

[02:20:43.890 --> 02:20:45.610]
Mom, I just made a wish.

[02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:47.330]
Get this in that.

[02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:49.530]
Oh, Mom.

[02:20:50.130 --> 02:20:50.810]
Have I?

[02:20:50.970 --> 02:20:51.590]
Yes, Kathy.

[02:20:52.430 --> 02:20:54.630]
You've been duched by an angel.

[02:20:54.990 --> 02:20:55.650]
Oh, Mom.

[02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:56.910]
Oh, Kathy.

[02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:58.010]
Oh, Stella.

[02:20:58.010 --> 02:21:03.490]
Turn in next week and find out what happens when Delegrease meets Mr. Team from the 18.

[02:21:03.870 --> 02:21:03.990]
What?

[02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:05.230]
You want to stick in, Mom?

[02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:08.030]
All next week on CIVIAC.

[02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:12.390]
Okay, now do you think this thing is going to pop up on it or not?

[02:21:12.730 --> 02:21:13.070]
That's a look.

[02:21:13.110 --> 02:21:14.130]
Because I think I just screwed it up.

[02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:17.230]
Anyways, 12, 14, and 5, 60, W and Q.M.

[02:21:17.330 --> 02:21:18.430]
I think I just screwed it up, George.

[02:21:18.810 --> 02:21:19.010]
Oh.

[02:21:20.230 --> 02:21:20.750]
Uh-oh.

[02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.790]

[02:21:21.030 --> 02:21:22.390]
I guess I better go back to that again.

[02:21:23.290 --> 02:21:24.650]
I hate this thing, yeah?

[02:21:25.310 --> 02:21:27.050]
When it works, it's great and when it doesn't work.

[02:21:27.230 --> 02:21:27.870]
Oh, there it is.

[02:21:27.970 --> 02:21:29.650]
The grease man, W-A-P-E Jacksonville.

[02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:34.590]
And I clicked it and says, stop your player and then go back to your browser and select a new exhibit.

[02:21:35.770 --> 02:21:36.410]
What does that mean?

[02:21:37.810 --> 02:21:38.750]
What the hell does that mean?

[02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:40.730]
Is the beast not going to get on the scale of the air?

[02:21:40.810 --> 02:21:41.590]
What are you getting on the scale?

[02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:43.410]
Or are you just, no, why not?

[02:21:44.250 --> 02:21:45.710]
Oh, I think I know why.

[02:21:45.870 --> 02:21:48.050]
Oh, tomorrow, yeah, he's probably in there and he stands in.

[02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:48.590]
He's puking.

[02:21:48.690 --> 02:21:50.030]
He's got a picture of Molleys looking at.

[02:21:50.470 --> 02:21:52.730]
Probably to inspire his puking.

[02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:55.090]
This is not for me.

[02:21:56.350 --> 02:21:57.530]
Oh my god.

[02:21:57.770 --> 02:21:58.810]
Look at that.

[02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:01.570]
That's, that's terrible.

[02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:05.410]
It's a picture of Molleys and his head is chopped off at the piece.

[02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:06.110]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:22:06.970 --> 02:22:07.630]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:22:07.750 --> 02:22:08.870]
Let's cut him off at the pass.

[02:22:08.990 --> 02:22:10.130]
Well, somebody cut him off at the piece.

[02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:11.390]
It's the before picture.

[02:22:11.570 --> 02:22:12.250]
Oh, brother.

[02:22:12.790 --> 02:22:13.190]
Well, let's see.

[02:22:13.410 --> 02:22:14.230]
Stop your player.

[02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.990]
Okay.

[02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:16.230]
Stop your player.

[02:22:16.290 --> 02:22:18.470]
Excuse me for doing this, but I just, I got no choice.

[02:22:19.150 --> 02:22:20.050]
Stop your player.

[02:22:20.570 --> 02:22:21.110]
There you go.

[02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:25.150]
Stop it and go back and take four steps back and then try it again.

[02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:26.050]
The grease man.

[02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:26.390]
Okay.

[02:22:26.490 --> 02:22:27.610]
You think this is going to work now or not?

[02:22:27.630 --> 02:22:27.730]
No.

[02:22:28.510 --> 02:22:29.170]
How do you know?

[02:22:29.410 --> 02:22:29.670]
I don't know.

[02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:30.130]
I'm just guessing.

[02:22:30.390 --> 02:22:30.950]
Well, there it is.

[02:22:31.090 --> 02:22:32.010]
It's, it's, uh, look at it.

[02:22:32.070 --> 02:22:35.890]
It's, uh, it's, uh, the old, uh, there you go.

[02:22:36.010 --> 02:22:36.470]
It's clicking.

[02:22:36.570 --> 02:22:36.950]
It's working.

[02:22:37.050 --> 02:22:37.450]
It's moving.

[02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:38.870]
It's sticking about it.

[02:22:38.930 --> 02:22:39.350]
It's stuck.

[02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:41.350]
It's stuck.

[02:22:43.390 --> 02:22:43.710]
Okay.

[02:22:43.870 --> 02:22:44.150]
You ready?

[02:22:45.050 --> 02:22:47.310]
Everybody knows this, um, let's sing the Miami version.

[02:22:47.490 --> 02:22:48.930]
We've heard this on three versions of the entire.

[02:22:49.150 --> 02:22:49.770]
Let's sing the Miami version.

[02:22:49.770 --> 02:22:53.550]
Shaking the θ, taking the θ, live, live, live.

[02:22:55.310 --> 02:23:00.550]
Shaking the highway, shaking the θ, taking the θ, live, live.

[02:23:02.110 --> 02:23:04.170]
Shaking the light with a guy on the hood.

[02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:07.750]
Shaking the θ, taking the θ, live, live.

[02:23:09.230 --> 02:23:10.990]
Shaking the light, I try to laugh.

[02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:12.970]
Shaking the light, I try to laugh.

[02:23:13.350 --> 02:23:14.670]
One is two minutes before seven hits,

[02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:16.610]
and the big A, but the grease man, I guess I'll a little Loki.

[02:23:16.610 --> 02:23:17.950]
I guess I'm a little hung.

[02:23:19.030 --> 02:23:20.730]
No, wait a little while and fall.

[02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:25.010]
I spent too much time this weekend at the risk of.

[02:23:29.350 --> 02:23:31.750]
Yeah, I walked into the door and my skin tight sat in pants

[02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:33.590]
and my shirt over the waist were going to cope with you

[02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:35.870]
as a mess of chess here, a new rid of egg like with aliens.

[02:23:36.290 --> 02:23:38.730]
With air that I saw at Oriental Girl, I walked up to her,

[02:23:38.810 --> 02:23:41.910]
I said, hey, you know what, it is true that it's a...

[02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:43.370]
It's a sad way.

[02:23:44.010 --> 02:23:47.450]
She said, oh no, not sideways, Honorable White Man.

[02:23:47.730 --> 02:23:49.750]
Not sideways, I said, okay, shoot yourself.

[02:23:50.210 --> 02:23:55.250]
But later on, I saw her go up to the top flight and slide down the banister

[02:23:55.250 --> 02:23:57.130]
and I heard a noise and sounded like this.

[02:23:59.250 --> 02:24:00.170]
Oh my god.

[02:24:01.430 --> 02:24:02.330]
Michael Jackson!

[02:24:02.910 --> 02:24:03.390]
No!

[02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:04.350]
No!

[02:24:04.830 --> 02:24:06.110]
Don't pick up the stove!

[02:24:06.590 --> 02:24:09.550]
Right now, 73, Jacksonville's big age.

[02:24:10.470 --> 02:24:11.010]
Oh no!

[02:24:14.030 --> 02:24:15.750]
Oh no! Double whammy!

[02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:18.610]
Not only did I start on the wrong speed, I got on the wrong side of the record.

[02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:21.010]
I am nothing, I am poop, I am do-noo!

[02:24:21.470 --> 02:24:23.550]
I am nothing, I am poop, I am poop, poop!

[02:24:23.850 --> 02:24:25.330]
Yeah, let me flexulate myself.

[02:24:26.470 --> 02:24:27.390]
I deserve a beer.

[02:24:27.610 --> 02:24:30.970]
This is difficult to do, but because I am that kind of guy, I'll do it.

[02:24:31.090 --> 02:24:33.770]
Oh my god!

[02:24:35.170 --> 02:24:36.490]
Oh my god!

[02:24:36.810 --> 02:24:39.310]
Oh my god!

[02:24:42.090 --> 02:24:42.450]
Okay!

[02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:43.290]
Back to the hill.

[02:24:44.530 --> 02:24:44.890]
Chal!

[02:24:46.750 --> 02:24:49.830]
Hey buddy, put your lips in that bang.

[02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:54.470]
Three minutes after the six of the big A-Voo, you ready to take a little trip by your fact?

[02:24:55.030 --> 02:24:59.370]
Well, you don't need much, you don't need you to go to the other end because where we're going, it's okay to stink.

[02:24:59.610 --> 02:24:59.830]
Cool!

[02:25:00.590 --> 02:25:01.890]
I must be coming here, huh?

[02:25:02.990 --> 02:25:04.630]
Chicken Man, we got. Thanks, Fat Boy.

[02:25:04.810 --> 02:25:06.210]
Fat Boy is just wheeling all over the building.

[02:25:06.210 --> 02:25:09.090]
It must have been a joy Reynolds thing that inspired him so much, you know what?

[02:25:09.710 --> 02:25:14.890]
I got it, I'm clicking it, it's not doing anything yet, but it will, okay?

[02:25:16.030 --> 02:25:18.850]
Just like Father or Tool of that whole, you know, it will, Billy, it will.

[02:25:19.050 --> 02:25:20.130]
I don't see a doing nothing now.

[02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:21.610]
I'm clicking play.

[02:25:22.030 --> 02:25:23.770]
Oh, you want to know why I didn't stop the other one?

[02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.750]
Did I stop the other one?

[02:25:26.450 --> 02:25:28.030]
The grease man, I stopped him.

[02:25:28.110 --> 02:25:29.030]
Get out of here, grease man.

[02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:31.990]
Well, we'll see, if it comes up, it'll come up and I'll just shut up.

[02:25:32.110 --> 02:25:33.210]
If not, good luck to work.

[02:25:34.210 --> 02:25:41.930]
Now, another exciting episode in the life of the most fantastic crime fighter the world has ever known.

[02:25:41.950 --> 02:25:43.710]
The most fun fun!

[02:25:50.830 --> 02:25:55.950]
Fence and Harper employed as a shoe salesman for a large downtown department store.

[02:25:55.950 --> 02:26:04.470]
Fence's weekends is only two days off, striking terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere as the white winged warrior called Chicken Man.

[02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:12.470]
How did it come about that Fence and Harper weekend winged warrior selected the visage of the chicken in his crusade against the forces of evil?

[02:26:13.170 --> 02:26:14.470]
Mal, it can be told.

[02:26:15.710 --> 02:26:16.870]
Yes, ma'am, I help you.

[02:26:17.330 --> 02:26:19.810]
How do you do? I'm looking for a costume.

[02:26:20.030 --> 02:26:21.070]
Oh, what did you have in mind?

[02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:24.070]
Something that will strike terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere.

[02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:25.970]
I see. Well, how about this?

[02:26:26.350 --> 02:26:27.510]
No, I don't think so.

[02:26:27.610 --> 02:26:28.590]
Why not try it on?

[02:26:28.730 --> 02:26:29.170]
Very well.

[02:26:29.430 --> 02:26:30.210]
Here, I'll help you.

[02:26:30.330 --> 02:26:30.810]
Thank you.

[02:26:31.610 --> 02:26:32.390]
There you are.

[02:26:32.530 --> 02:26:33.550]
Take a look at the mirror.

[02:26:34.230 --> 02:26:34.830]
Not bad.

[02:26:35.370 --> 02:26:38.590]
I wonder if you would permit me to conduct a quick experiment outside this store.

[02:26:38.830 --> 02:26:39.130]
Certainly.

[02:26:46.250 --> 02:26:47.190]
Pardon me, sir.

[02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:47.650]
Yeah?

[02:26:48.150 --> 02:26:49.730]
Are you by chance a vicious criminal?

[02:26:50.830 --> 02:26:51.170]
Fine.

[02:26:51.330 --> 02:26:53.050]
Would you take a look at this cost you by worrying?

[02:26:53.050 --> 02:26:53.570]
Yeah.

[02:26:54.050 --> 02:26:55.330]
Do you feel anything strange?

[02:26:56.230 --> 02:26:57.330]
Anything at all.

[02:26:57.950 --> 02:26:58.350]
Oh, yeah.

[02:26:58.730 --> 02:26:59.490]
And what is that?

[02:27:00.130 --> 02:27:01.430]
I'd like to kiss you.

[02:27:02.290 --> 02:27:02.870]
Kiss me?

[02:27:03.370 --> 02:27:03.550]
Yeah.

[02:27:04.090 --> 02:27:05.090]
I'll be with Com for that.

[02:27:05.650 --> 02:27:07.750]
Because you look like an adorable bunny rabbit.

[02:27:12.850 --> 02:27:13.970]
Well, how did it go?

[02:27:14.930 --> 02:27:16.270]
What else do you have?

[02:27:16.690 --> 02:27:18.230]
Teddy bear and a chicken.

[02:27:18.690 --> 02:27:19.590]
A teddy bear?

[02:27:19.590 --> 02:27:20.530]
It'd be cute.

[02:27:20.930 --> 02:27:22.270]
Wrap up the chicken, please.

[02:27:23.390 --> 02:27:28.690]
The listening tomorrow for another exciting episode in the life of the most fantastic

[02:27:28.690 --> 02:27:32.070]
flying fighter the world has ever known.

[02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:33.770]
The most fun fun!

[02:27:35.790 --> 02:27:36.110]
Chicken!

[02:27:37.730 --> 02:27:38.490]
The most fun!

[02:27:40.030 --> 02:27:40.510]
Yeah.

[02:27:40.750 --> 02:27:42.710]
I see that one was kind of weak because it was the first one.

[02:27:43.130 --> 02:27:43.970]
This was a series.

[02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.850]
It was a serial thing.

[02:27:45.010 --> 02:27:46.050]
You know, like a thing.

[02:27:47.650 --> 02:27:50.950]
It was a syndicated thing like A, C, N, and A, C, and all these others.

[02:27:51.130 --> 02:27:52.290]
And stations, rock stations.

[02:27:52.290 --> 02:27:53.490]
We had it in a Kalamazoo.

[02:27:53.530 --> 02:27:54.110]
We had chicken man.

[02:27:54.650 --> 02:27:55.270]
We had to be there.

[02:27:56.210 --> 02:27:59.910]
560, 7.0560, 0.560, 0.60 on the 18 and T in the Verizon line.

[02:28:00.250 --> 02:28:01.930]
You know, we could still add other stations to it.

[02:28:02.010 --> 02:28:03.970]
Probably unlikely because they're going to get all bent out of shape.

[02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:07.590]
And once he starts getting ready up, said he starts really eating heavy duty.

[02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:07.870]
You know?

[02:28:08.210 --> 02:28:08.770]
Well, I do have to.

[02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:09.910]
I do want to put this on here.

[02:28:10.470 --> 02:28:11.630]
Well, here's a moosey man.

[02:28:11.790 --> 02:28:13.190]
The result of that session.

[02:28:16.290 --> 02:28:20.370]
They have a press conference every day to tell the public that we know nothing.

[02:28:21.230 --> 02:28:23.970]
And that they're discounted the description of the van by the one witness.

[02:28:24.350 --> 02:28:25.290]
We don't believe them now.

[02:28:25.490 --> 02:28:28.630]
So every day they come out and tell us they know less than we thought they knew before.

[02:28:29.710 --> 02:28:32.870]
And I will keep you telling them we need some privacy and we need to be left alone

[02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:36.350]
and don't be button in here and interfering with our investigation, even though we know nothing.

[02:28:36.730 --> 02:28:38.110]
So the moosey man is on the loose.

[02:28:38.170 --> 02:28:38.950]
On a report on that.

[02:28:39.270 --> 02:28:39.390]
Yeah.

[02:28:40.670 --> 02:28:46.550]
Anyway, one week before Governor Jeff Bush signed a controversial bill in April that made it harder for local communities to be moved billboards.

[02:28:46.970 --> 02:28:52.690]
The founder of one of Florida's biggest billboard companies gave $25,000 to the Republican Party of Florida.

[02:28:52.770 --> 02:28:52.890]
Oh!

[02:28:53.590 --> 02:28:58.510]
The money came in two personal checks from Carl Ellor of Phoenix a long time contributed to Republican candidates.

[02:28:59.010 --> 02:29:00.130]
And the founder of Ellor Media.

[02:29:00.610 --> 02:29:03.430]
Ellor sold the company its vast billboard in Venturi 2.

[02:29:03.430 --> 02:29:13.210]
Clear channel communications for $1.2 billion in 1997 and served as chairman and CEO of the company's OptiRatvising Unit to last year.

[02:29:14.470 --> 02:29:21.910]
Ellor's gifts of 20 grand of the state's EOP and 5 grand of the party's federal account are both listed by the party's having received March 28th.

[02:29:21.930 --> 02:29:26.710]
That date fell midway between a two week period after the legislature passed the bill and before Bush be signing it.

[02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:30.230]
To one leading critic of the billboard industry it doesn't look like a coincidence.

[02:29:30.770 --> 02:29:40.870]
A major player in the OptiRatvising Industry was taken a distinct interest in Florida politics said Bill Britton, a Jacksonville lawyer and chairman of Citizens for Scenic Florida, which has been battling the industry on various fronts.

[02:29:41.090 --> 02:29:45.830]
All I know is its horrible public policy said it's horrible is what he said.

[02:29:46.270 --> 02:29:47.550]
Just a coincidence, Annett?

[02:29:48.270 --> 02:29:48.790]
No.

[02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.170]
No.

[02:29:50.610 --> 02:29:51.130]
WQAN?

[02:29:52.450 --> 02:29:53.210]
Yes sir.

[02:29:53.730 --> 02:29:57.330]
I just want to tell you that that chicken man that you played.

[02:29:57.450 --> 02:29:57.550]
Yeah.

[02:29:59.150 --> 02:30:03.030]
Rick Shaw used to play it back in the 60s.

[02:30:03.090 --> 02:30:05.030]
I know you just said it was a syndicated thing.

[02:30:05.070 --> 02:30:05.210]
Right.

[02:30:05.770 --> 02:30:09.350]
And he used to play it also on the OQAM.

[02:30:09.850 --> 02:30:13.090]
And also there's a, just want to tell you there's a website.

[02:30:13.230 --> 02:30:16.510]
It's called Real Radio, R-E-E-L.

[02:30:16.690 --> 02:30:16.970]
No.

[02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:17.730]
Radio, one word.

[02:30:18.010 --> 02:30:19.550]
Well where do you think I'm playing all this stuff from?

[02:30:20.090 --> 02:30:20.970]
Oh, that one is from?

[02:30:21.210 --> 02:30:21.410]
Yeah.

[02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:23.090]
Oh, I didn't know that.

[02:30:23.090 --> 02:30:23.530]
That's okay.

[02:30:23.810 --> 02:30:24.450]
Don't feel bad.

[02:30:25.490 --> 02:30:25.950]
All right.

[02:30:26.110 --> 02:30:27.090]
I just didn't know if you know.

[02:30:27.270 --> 02:30:28.050]
Just don't do it again.

[02:30:28.130 --> 02:30:29.450]
That's a cool site because, okay.

[02:30:29.810 --> 02:30:30.170]
I promise.

[02:30:30.310 --> 02:30:30.510]
Thanks.

[02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.310]
All right.

[02:30:31.590 --> 02:30:35.930]
I actually had some faxes on it and I realized you can't listen right from the beginning so they don't know where I'm getting all of the stuff.

[02:30:36.190 --> 02:30:39.390]
It's from the website RealRadio.com.

[02:30:39.930 --> 02:30:41.810]
R-E-E-L, RealRadio.com.

[02:30:42.130 --> 02:30:46.910]
So, you know, if we only do this for like four or five hundred days, there'll probably be a lot of other stuff on there.

[02:30:46.910 --> 02:30:47.670]
We don't have time to play.

[02:30:47.810 --> 02:30:52.490]
In addition to which all of these things, every one of these clips was not a lot longer than what I'm playing, you know.

[02:30:52.650 --> 02:30:54.450]
If I wanted to just be take the lazy way out.

[02:30:55.370 --> 02:30:58.670]
Like this one, for example, goes on for 26 and a half minutes.

[02:30:59.390 --> 02:31:00.070]
Are you ready for that?

[02:31:00.210 --> 02:31:01.810]
Well, I don't think I clicked it right.

[02:31:01.910 --> 02:31:04.050]
I'm trying to click it and it just don't seem to want to do anything.

[02:31:04.530 --> 02:31:06.690]
The Dave Mickey show, C-K-E-Y and Toronto.

[02:31:07.150 --> 02:31:08.910]
C-K-E-Y, it seems to be.

[02:31:10.770 --> 02:31:13.230]
I'm going to play a trumpet.

[02:31:16.090 --> 02:31:16.890]
It's like five eight eight in the ball.

[02:31:16.890 --> 02:31:18.950]
It feels like I'm from Steve and Bobby and Barley and Vorzell.

[02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:22.650]
And I was supposed to say hello to a quirky buck up there.

[02:31:22.810 --> 02:31:23.390]
That's like golden.

[02:31:23.550 --> 02:31:26.050]
A quirky buck as in a quirky thing of a chick there.

[02:31:26.190 --> 02:31:27.770]
And I have a dog named Porkey.

[02:31:29.270 --> 02:31:30.550]
Heads above that time.

[02:31:30.690 --> 02:31:31.570]
It's what he means for that.

[02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:32.190]
Hi.

[02:31:32.990 --> 02:31:33.950]
Porkey, Gordon.

[02:31:34.370 --> 02:31:35.430]
We'll be number two.

[02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:38.310]
Barba lets the solo doll sound on five, baby.

[02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:38.730]
Here.

[02:31:38.830 --> 02:31:42.330]
C-K-E-Y, into Toronto.

[02:31:43.330 --> 02:31:43.530]
Yeah.

[02:31:44.510 --> 02:31:50.630]
Hey, I like this style, man. This is all a gold. I'm the only big show at the time. I'm still 11 live at this show.

[02:31:50.770 --> 02:31:53.390]
Here's the big shot with the bottle X set out of the basket.

[02:31:53.650 --> 02:31:56.330]
V-1, 4-5, 7, 8 times.

[02:31:57.670 --> 02:32:08.230]
You can't have this dance with me. You can't be just a part of it. You can't have the dance with me.

[02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:13.130]
That means what? 4-5, 7-8 times. It's all a gold. All of us are gold. That's 2 at the night time. All the living show right to you.

[02:32:13.270 --> 02:32:14.590]
I'm fine. Me, you know what I want.

[02:32:16.130 --> 02:32:21.130]
Exactly. That's exactly right. Whatever that song was, he made the earthy end. They're all on speed, baby.

[02:32:21.430 --> 02:32:29.610]
Wow. Man. Between the reverb and the hysteria. No wonder everybody was all whipped up and jammed up and jelly tight.

[02:32:30.070 --> 02:32:34.890]
Whatever that song was. Who did that? Jam up and Dilly. What is it? Total. Dilly tight.

[02:32:35.970 --> 02:32:41.690]
You didn't hear the grease man because somebody was bugging you about something else, but he was doing about talking about the gauyme and stuff.

[02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:48.490]
It was great. Did you hear that? Yes. Sensationally. Something about Kiss my Tuchas. And he actually said it like that.

[02:32:50.050 --> 02:33:01.570]
26th afternoon at 5.60 WQAM. Let me tell you about an easy thing. A piece of cake. Shopping for a new mattress. Just make one easy call. Reach over. Pick up your instrument right now. Stick your finger on it and call 1-800-Matrus.

[02:33:01.570 --> 02:33:06.610]
There will be no time at all. Delivering right to your door. One of the greatest mattresses is probably the best one you've ever had.

[02:33:07.270 --> 02:33:12.770]
Name brands were talking about the best in the world. Serta, Celi Simmons, King Coyle. And your bed is so damn important for you.

[02:33:12.870 --> 02:33:20.850]
Just think of all the things you do on your bed, for example. Besides sleeping. And as far as the sleeping part is concerned, if your back isn't feeling right, you're not feeling right and you've got a problem.

[02:33:21.570 --> 02:33:24.590]
And probably a good part of that problem is a crappy old Worn Out mattress.

[02:33:24.590 --> 02:33:32.490]
So get a great mattress today by making that one easy call. 1-800-Matrus. Like I always do. You pick that in the 2-R-Winter 4 delivery. 7 days a week when it's convenient for you.

[02:33:32.570 --> 02:33:43.270]
Like between noon and 2, 1-3, 2-4, 3-17-5-17, etc. And you get that 30-day in-home comfort guarantee. So you can test it out the smart way. Not like Frado, but the smart way.

[02:33:43.410 --> 02:33:49.430]
By sleeping on it and doing your thing on it for up to a month. So call them right now. They'll be there and knock it on your door like I said in no time at all.

[02:33:49.430 --> 02:33:55.270]
1-800-Matrus. 1-800-Matrus. Let's do the thing about Miguel in the spot too about how he's screwing his brains on it.

[02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:58.930]

Lt.ここ Outdoor

[02:36:15.090 --> 02:36:15.630]
slвон Hello my man this is

[02:36:15.630 --> 02:36:15.810]
Jim familiar with ONE

[02:36:15.810 --> 02:36:17.210]
Thursday and that's very exciting.

[02:36:17.330 --> 02:36:18.030]
Hard to do.

[02:36:18.330 --> 02:36:19.070]
It's wonderful.

[02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:21.050]
Never you hear.

[02:36:22.010 --> 02:36:23.270]
Not today on Monday, right?

[02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:24.870]
We're hearing.

[02:36:25.570 --> 02:36:25.870]
We're hearing.

[02:36:26.330 --> 02:36:27.310]
We're hearing.

[02:36:28.390 --> 02:36:29.570]
We're hearing.

[02:36:29.570 --> 02:36:29.570]

[02:36:32.510 --> 02:36:33.730]
You can smell.

[02:36:34.330 --> 02:36:35.330]
You can be.

[02:36:36.050 --> 02:36:39.030]
I was at risk but I'm new.

[02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:41.070]
You smile again.

[02:36:41.470 --> 02:36:42.530]
Now we're true.

[02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:47.410]
Well, 15, don't be cute.

[02:36:47.650 --> 02:36:50.310]
Have a clue for you in the big car clue thing.

[02:36:50.470 --> 02:36:51.630]
A couple of minutes right here.

[02:36:51.850 --> 02:36:52.310]
Jimmy Gellard.

[02:36:52.510 --> 02:36:55.350]
Maybe you should be on the track.

[02:36:58.650 --> 02:36:59.310]
There you go.

[02:36:59.430 --> 02:37:02.350]
Jimmy Gellard, the Fireballs, and a thing called Sugar Shack.

[02:37:02.490 --> 02:37:03.970]
One of the great big ones exclusively heard.

[02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:05.190]
First right here on.

[02:37:05.290 --> 02:37:06.270]
Wind and snow.

[02:37:08.430 --> 02:37:08.890]
WQA.

[02:37:09.670 --> 02:37:10.590]
Stand there.

[02:37:11.550 --> 02:37:15.050]
Okay, the minute or so here stand by because I'm ready to give you a big clue

[02:37:15.050 --> 02:37:16.130]
on the car thing.

[02:37:16.290 --> 02:37:21.910]
The first thing I want to remind you that the day county agricultural department invites you to invite you to visit our offices.

[02:37:22.430 --> 02:37:23.750]
Are you going to visit the office?

[02:37:24.510 --> 02:37:26.170]
The day county agricultural office.

[02:37:26.570 --> 02:37:28.590]
I am the day county agricultural office.

[02:37:28.670 --> 02:37:29.130]
Oh, I see.

[02:37:29.230 --> 02:37:32.330]
Well, then you'll likely to tell the folks out there and ready a lad.

[02:37:32.990 --> 02:37:35.070]
Listen, tomato flights left through properly and a condition.

[02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:36.630]
We're hearing tell them about them planet panchants.

[02:37:36.750 --> 02:37:38.890]
What's going to happen if you put them in a hot house?

[02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:40.290]
Well, you're going to wilt.

[02:37:40.650 --> 02:37:41.910]
Well, yeah.

[02:37:41.910 --> 02:37:43.450]
I imagine.

[02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:44.550]
That's what I thought you'd say.

[02:37:44.710 --> 02:37:46.410]
Be sure to wait until the weather turns a little cooler.

[02:37:46.750 --> 02:37:48.690]
Well, we're planning to make those friends.

[02:37:48.870 --> 02:37:49.150]
Oh, yeah.

[02:37:49.350 --> 02:37:56.010]
But, lighting says WQA here is with the crisis under the fall.

[02:37:57.350 --> 02:37:57.790]
WQA.

[02:37:58.530 --> 02:37:59.890]
Come on, come on.

[02:38:00.130 --> 02:38:01.230]
Look at my going places.

[02:38:01.390 --> 02:38:04.630]
Okay, here goes a clue as to where car number three.

[02:38:04.850 --> 02:38:05.610]
Did you hear that?

[02:38:06.290 --> 02:38:07.910]
The reverb went in like you picked up there.

[02:38:08.490 --> 02:38:09.070]
It says on here.

[02:38:09.070 --> 02:38:16.010]
It says both FU and QM had what they call accent reverb and the jack pushed a button to kick it into loud.

[02:38:17.730 --> 02:38:18.930]
Which he just did right there.

[02:38:19.110 --> 02:38:22.410]
So there was a lot of old devices like in broom closets and carriages.

[02:38:22.770 --> 02:38:23.130]
Yeah.

[02:38:23.370 --> 02:38:30.270]
So there was a button on the board and when he wanted to give the assent to one of them and have a really heavy duty reverb like we just heard there.

[02:38:30.390 --> 02:38:30.990]
He did it.

[02:38:31.150 --> 02:38:32.130]
By the way, love the show.

[02:38:32.250 --> 02:38:34.290]
It's Tommy Rowe says some facts right there.

[02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:35.890]
Tommy Rowe jam up and jolly tight.

[02:38:36.210 --> 02:38:36.950]
Thank you very much.

[02:38:37.510 --> 02:38:38.250]
Love the show.

[02:38:39.210 --> 02:38:41.270]
Tommy Rowe rhymes with Mo.

[02:38:42.870 --> 02:38:44.650]
5 6 7 0 5 6 8.

[02:38:44.650 --> 02:38:48.130]
You mean to say it's 25 to 1 already and that was really match.

[02:38:48.290 --> 02:38:48.650]
Rudge.

[02:38:49.450 --> 02:38:49.910]
Good.

[02:38:50.290 --> 02:38:50.550]
God.

[02:38:52.190 --> 02:38:52.650]
WQA.

[02:38:52.830 --> 02:38:52.830]

[02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:54.050]
Yeah.

[02:38:54.350 --> 02:38:54.650]
Yeah.

[02:38:54.670 --> 02:38:55.950]
Get a chance to talk to Neil.

[02:38:56.150 --> 02:38:57.110]
You're speaking to him, sir.

[02:38:57.710 --> 02:38:58.510]
Oh, Neil Roger.

[02:38:58.650 --> 02:38:59.270]
Yes, it is.

[02:38:59.350 --> 02:39:02.150]
You remember that from Mr.

[02:39:02.330 --> 02:39:02.610]
Custer.

[02:39:03.150 --> 02:39:04.270]
Yeah, please, Mr. Custer.

[02:39:04.770 --> 02:39:06.010]
By Larry Vaughn.

[02:39:06.070 --> 02:39:06.290]
Right.

[02:39:06.290 --> 02:39:07.130]
Larry Vaughn.

[02:39:07.150 --> 02:39:08.990]
What about one column, Mr. Bush?

[02:39:10.050 --> 02:39:11.110]
Please, Mr. Boy.

[02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:11.830]
Yeah, it's a good idea.

[02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:13.230]
We'll pass on to Boca-Brown, OK?

[02:39:13.470 --> 02:39:14.230]
Yeah, there I go.

[02:39:14.450 --> 02:39:18.090]
Still with a rocket in mind, but with a rocket in your butt.

[02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.830]
OK, thank you.

[02:39:19.430 --> 02:39:22.310]
He said, Mr. Boy, go over there with a rocket in your butt or something like that.

[02:39:22.470 --> 02:39:22.990]
And that what he said.

[02:39:23.130 --> 02:39:23.750]
I think.

[02:39:24.770 --> 02:39:25.930]
Mr. Robert, please, Mr. Custer.

[02:39:26.110 --> 02:39:26.290]
By Larry Vaughn.

[02:39:26.570 --> 02:39:27.430]
Of course I'll horrible record.

[02:39:27.530 --> 02:39:29.110]
Man, it was one of the worst records ever made.

[02:39:30.670 --> 02:39:32.010]
So I think we got every station.

[02:39:32.130 --> 02:39:33.150]
Let's see how that thing is coming.

[02:39:33.150 --> 02:39:34.490]
I know that this station is going to win.

[02:39:34.490 --> 02:39:36.090]
People are going to say, well, he put that on there.

[02:39:36.190 --> 02:39:37.170]
So QA, I would look good.

[02:39:37.230 --> 02:39:38.830]
What's the kind of deal with what we're doing now?

[02:39:39.550 --> 02:39:39.870]
Nothing.

[02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:43.130]
No, an admission which I, if I were to vote it, which I couldn't vote at home.

[02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:45.730]
I would have voted for Keener and Detroit, WKNR.

[02:39:45.950 --> 02:39:48.810]
And obviously, like I told you, we don't have any Midwestern people out there.

[02:39:49.110 --> 02:39:49.510]
What is it got?

[02:39:49.650 --> 02:39:50.030]
One vote?

[02:39:50.570 --> 02:39:51.210]
One vote.

[02:39:52.650 --> 02:39:53.270]
WKNR, Detroit.

[02:39:53.470 --> 02:39:54.930]
I mean, that's scandalous.

[02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:56.830]
That is scandalous.

[02:39:57.770 --> 02:39:58.490]
What about WSYZ?

[02:39:59.810 --> 02:40:00.710]
WCFL's only got one?

[02:40:03.290 --> 02:40:03.610]
WLW.

[02:40:03.610 --> 02:40:04.730]
I think he's going to do, where did that come from?

[02:40:04.830 --> 02:40:05.610]
That's incensanity.

[02:40:05.770 --> 02:40:07.590]
But where did they come from?

[02:40:08.630 --> 02:40:11.330]
I think he's playing fast and loose with us here and sticking some of them.

[02:40:11.390 --> 02:40:13.830]
I mean, it's fine, Eric, it's a great station or at least he used to be.

[02:40:14.410 --> 02:40:18.430]
But, he's got his own damn thing going on over there.

[02:40:18.990 --> 02:40:19.910]
Okay, five or more.

[02:40:20.730 --> 02:40:23.010]
Greatest top 40am radio station ever.

[02:40:24.550 --> 02:40:25.690]
WMC in New York five.

[02:40:26.390 --> 02:40:27.690]
Sorry, just changed again.

[02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:31.370]
C-K-L-W-W-A-P-E to big 8-5.

[02:40:32.310 --> 02:40:39.850]
WNBC 6, KDKA 6, WFU8, WLS 14, WABC 18, and WQAM 46.

[02:40:40.110 --> 02:40:40.250]
Oh!

[02:40:40.610 --> 02:40:41.710]
God are we doing it, huh?

[02:40:42.410 --> 02:40:45.590]
So on Monday, if the numbers come out really crappy, I'll just whip this thing out and

[02:40:45.590 --> 02:40:46.970]
say, hey, look at this, they still love us, you know?

[02:40:47.290 --> 02:40:47.990]
They think we're the best.

[02:40:49.230 --> 02:40:51.090]
Release used to be about 40 years ago anyway.

[02:40:51.970 --> 02:40:54.530]
Don't forget, join Joe Costello and my, what is it?

[02:40:54.590 --> 02:40:55.690]
See, why do they say that way?

[02:40:55.850 --> 02:40:57.930]
I don't want to start picking on Miguel again, he writes great promos.

[02:40:58.830 --> 02:41:00.210]
He'll start bitching you out again.

[02:41:00.350 --> 02:41:00.590]
I know.

[02:41:00.590 --> 02:41:02.190]
It's just strange the way it's written.

[02:41:02.530 --> 02:41:04.050]
Join Joe Costello and Mike's hard lemonade.

[02:41:04.230 --> 02:41:04.870]
Is Mike going to be there?

[02:41:05.290 --> 02:41:05.730]
Personally.

[02:41:06.370 --> 02:41:07.210]
Is he going to be hard?

[02:41:07.690 --> 02:41:08.470]
Hardening the lemonade.

[02:41:09.270 --> 02:41:14.410]
Join Joe Costello and Mike's hard lemonade this afternoon, 4 to 6 in publics at 1305 University

[02:41:14.410 --> 02:41:15.210]
Driving Coral Springs.

[02:41:15.390 --> 02:41:19.450]
Stop by to win prizes and register to win a pair of really great tickets to the homes

[02:41:19.450 --> 02:41:20.750]
that Miami Speedway in November.

[02:41:21.070 --> 02:41:22.790]
That sounds like a Joey Seat thing that last part.

[02:41:23.530 --> 02:41:26.110]
Sounds like an incestuous Speedway thing, you know?

[02:41:27.190 --> 02:41:28.690]
Because he's obsessed with that crap.

[02:41:30.010 --> 02:41:32.610]
22 to 1, we got the mad dog at 1 o'clock.

[02:41:32.610 --> 02:41:34.250]
Hank has got a full four hours today.

[02:41:34.450 --> 02:41:35.330]
Wow, man.

[02:41:35.630 --> 02:41:38.990]
He must be in leadies and Cheerios and the brand muffins.

[02:41:39.930 --> 02:41:44.450]
And then speaking of brand muffins, he's got between 5 and 6, Bino as part of the show

[02:41:44.450 --> 02:41:45.530]
today between 3 and 7.

[02:41:45.870 --> 02:41:48.970]
The big, well, I'm going to be out of the game 7 and 10 because we have nobody else who

[02:41:48.970 --> 02:41:49.490]
will work that cheap.

[02:41:50.530 --> 02:41:53.770]
And then you got the Citcoe Panther preview 8 to 830.

[02:41:53.890 --> 02:41:56.730]
And of course if Brian Murray were still a GM, how would he say Citcoe?

[02:41:56.730 --> 02:42:00.730]
And then you got Florida Panthers at the Black Cawks 830 following the hockey game at

[02:42:00.730 --> 02:42:02.570]
8K and doing Mark overnight.

[02:42:03.650 --> 02:42:04.690]
Yeah, it goes.

[02:42:05.270 --> 02:42:06.170]
Don't be doing that now.

[02:42:06.330 --> 02:42:07.730]
Don't be doing a Brian Murray on there.

[02:42:07.950 --> 02:42:08.910]
You got the problems already.

[02:42:09.030 --> 02:42:10.570]
Moe's got a snitch on you if you do that.

[02:42:11.350 --> 02:42:13.710]
Especially after those comments you made today about his rug.

[02:42:14.910 --> 02:42:17.730]
I made some new comments about dry concepts couldn't clean his room.

[02:42:17.730 --> 02:42:18.370]
Oh, yeah, that's right.

[02:42:18.370 --> 02:42:18.990]
Something like that.

[02:42:19.410 --> 02:42:20.070]
That's what they do.

[02:42:20.290 --> 02:42:21.970]
21 to 1 at 560 WQM.

[02:42:22.770 --> 02:42:26.630]
Does this sound like you perhaps overworked and underpaid, stuck in a really horrendous

[02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:29.150]
crappy, useless, dead end job underappreciated?

[02:42:29.290 --> 02:42:30.430]
I bet you a lot of you feel that way.

[02:42:30.970 --> 02:42:32.930]
Like all of us here feel underappreciated.

[02:42:33.030 --> 02:42:36.370]

There's a butt.

[02:43:46.930 --> 02:43:47.550]
I smell it.

[02:43:47.730 --> 02:43:51.050]
Uncle Billy, when I get older, will you marry me?

[02:43:51.250 --> 02:43:52.250]
Oh, I am.

[02:43:52.250 --> 02:43:53.850]
I won't be getting married again.

[02:43:54.250 --> 02:43:56.130]
Besides, I don't think I can keep up with you.

[02:43:56.170 --> 02:43:59.030]
But Mama says that's why you drink for sure.

[02:43:59.470 --> 02:44:02.450]
Your Mama gives me that so I have enough energy to keep it up.

[02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:03.930]
I mean, keep up with her.

[02:44:04.190 --> 02:44:05.010]
Keep what up.

[02:44:05.170 --> 02:44:06.810]
You'll learn about that a little later.

[02:44:07.130 --> 02:44:10.950]
Right now, I need to can it for sure because your Mama is bringing home a girlfriend

[02:44:10.950 --> 02:44:14.370]
and we're going to sail the old skin boat to beaver coals.

[02:44:14.410 --> 02:44:15.710]
Where's beaver coals?

[02:44:15.890 --> 02:44:16.330]
For sure.

[02:44:16.810 --> 02:44:18.270]
Raises more than just energy.

[02:44:19.810 --> 02:44:20.170]
Yeah.

[02:44:20.530 --> 02:44:21.930]
Oh, and that thing came up again.

[02:44:22.270 --> 02:44:23.290]
Damn it.

[02:44:23.350 --> 02:44:24.070]
Oh, no.

[02:44:24.450 --> 02:44:25.170]
Server alert.

[02:44:27.130 --> 02:44:28.010]
Oh, you're playing that.

[02:44:28.190 --> 02:44:28.350]
Yeah.

[02:44:28.770 --> 02:44:29.990]
I never even know if it's going to come.

[02:44:30.090 --> 02:44:31.050]
Let me try one more time.

[02:44:31.850 --> 02:44:32.650]
It's a fill in.

[02:44:34.350 --> 02:44:35.630]
I thought you got a new accountant.

[02:44:35.830 --> 02:44:36.770]
I don't want to play that thing.

[02:44:36.870 --> 02:44:38.150]
Lee Allen, WSYZ.

[02:44:38.450 --> 02:44:39.870]
Well, I'll be gosh dang, man.

[02:44:40.930 --> 02:44:42.330]
5-6-7-0-5-60.

[02:44:42.510 --> 02:44:45.310]
Pound 5-60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:44:45.710 --> 02:44:46.970]
16 to 1 o'clock already.

[02:44:46.970 --> 02:44:49.510]
I feel like I just sat my fat ass down here, you know what?

[02:44:50.390 --> 02:44:51.370]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[02:44:51.970 --> 02:44:52.330]
Yes.

[02:44:52.670 --> 02:44:54.390]
Stick fine rig over the racetrack.

[02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:54.870]
Hi, Dick.

[02:44:55.090 --> 02:44:55.390]
How you doing?

[02:44:55.810 --> 02:44:56.030]
Good.

[02:44:56.250 --> 02:44:56.890]
We're on the ear, Dick.

[02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:59.770]
I think I know the guy at WBBS.

[02:45:00.570 --> 02:45:01.030]
Jo Dean.

[02:45:01.890 --> 02:45:02.770]
Leon Marguerite.

[02:45:03.590 --> 02:45:04.030]
No.

[02:45:04.390 --> 02:45:04.790]
Jo Dean.

[02:45:05.110 --> 02:45:06.170]
Jerry Fogel?

[02:45:06.670 --> 02:45:07.810]
Jerry Fogel was on him.

[02:45:07.930 --> 02:45:08.870]
Jo Dean, Nick Nixon.

[02:45:10.690 --> 02:45:11.130]
Also.

[02:45:11.410 --> 02:45:11.650]
Yes?

[02:45:12.110 --> 02:45:14.150]
My mother dated Howard Samuels.

[02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:15.210]
Oh, no.

[02:45:15.870 --> 02:45:17.730]
Presumably before she married my father.

[02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:19.750]
Did he give her a big bag of money?

[02:45:20.290 --> 02:45:22.390]
Well, you know, the details are kind of hazy.

[02:45:22.490 --> 02:45:23.870]
I was very young at the time.

[02:45:23.990 --> 02:45:24.830]
I don't think I was born.

[02:45:25.210 --> 02:45:25.390]
Yeah.

[02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:28.410]
All I can tell you is I went to school with this kid Bill Samuels.

[02:45:28.470 --> 02:45:29.230]
It was a good looking kid.

[02:45:29.230 --> 02:45:31.950]
He was a year behind me in school and a real idiot, a jerk.

[02:45:33.110 --> 02:45:37.370]
Well, I know Howard certainly made his name well known.

[02:45:37.930 --> 02:45:38.650]
Yeah, he sure did.

[02:45:39.170 --> 02:45:41.950]
And hey, thanks for the WKBW stuff.

[02:45:42.130 --> 02:45:43.610]
I was a big fan of Danny Nevers.

[02:45:43.610 --> 02:45:44.110]
Yeah.

[02:45:44.330 --> 02:45:45.830]
He was all over chicken man too.

[02:45:45.950 --> 02:45:47.010]
And don't forget Max Robinson.

[02:45:47.270 --> 02:45:48.910]
Oh, and there.

[02:45:49.450 --> 02:45:50.490]
And June Weller.

[02:45:51.190 --> 02:45:52.530]
You know, you almost killed me.

[02:45:52.690 --> 02:45:53.570]
I was on 95.

[02:45:53.770 --> 02:45:53.950]
Yeah.

[02:45:54.170 --> 02:45:57.710]
And I hear B. Farber, Bobby Huntress and June Weller,

[02:45:57.710 --> 02:45:59.310]
I had to swerve to avoid easier.

[02:45:59.710 --> 02:46:00.050]
Yeah.

[02:46:01.610 --> 02:46:04.550]
Hey, listen, you might as well stop and give him at least

[02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:05.950]
to wash him down a little bit too.

[02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:07.130]
He's probably got a lot mud on him.

[02:46:07.410 --> 02:46:10.030]
You know, he's buried in the infield at Bay Meadows,

[02:46:10.730 --> 02:46:12.070]
outside of San Francisco.

[02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:14.270]
I saw him set the track record at Northfield Downs,

[02:46:14.270 --> 02:46:15.610]
or at least where he used to be at the track record.

[02:46:15.770 --> 02:46:16.590]
He was the hell of a horse.

[02:46:16.730 --> 02:46:19.890]
Well, with June Weller's maiden name before she married J. Weller.

[02:46:19.990 --> 02:46:20.250]
Dillard.

[02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:21.030]
That's right.

[02:46:21.270 --> 02:46:21.710]
You Dillman.

[02:46:21.990 --> 02:46:22.490]
Dillman, right?

[02:46:22.550 --> 02:46:23.030]
Well, I was close.

[02:46:23.350 --> 02:46:23.890]
Red Argon.

[02:46:24.250 --> 02:46:24.930]
How do you like that?

[02:46:25.110 --> 02:46:26.050]
I'm on top of it, man.

[02:46:26.150 --> 02:46:28.270]
You see, you got to go a long way to catch me.

[02:46:28.670 --> 02:46:30.950]
Then I'll start throwing some of those Detroit names at you.

[02:46:30.990 --> 02:46:32.350]
You won't have any idea who I'm talking about.

[02:46:32.550 --> 02:46:33.170]
Well, it could be.

[02:46:33.290 --> 02:46:35.270]
What about, I thought you were coming out last night.

[02:46:35.450 --> 02:46:36.510]
I'm coming out this weekend.

[02:46:36.990 --> 02:46:38.690]
Okay, I've got a homecoming gift for you.

[02:46:38.770 --> 02:46:38.990]
Really?

[02:46:39.310 --> 02:46:39.550]
Yes.

[02:46:39.550 --> 02:46:42.110]
I hope it's a big bag of money to make up for last season.

[02:46:42.350 --> 02:46:42.830]
Are you a weller?

[02:46:42.950 --> 02:46:44.010]
It's a big bag of something.

[02:46:44.890 --> 02:46:46.530]
Probably Walling Hennessy left it for me.

[02:46:47.090 --> 02:46:48.810]
I can imagine what would be in that sack.

[02:46:49.450 --> 02:46:50.330]
See you this weekend, Dick.

[02:46:50.490 --> 02:46:51.650]
Okay, thanks, bye-bye.

[02:46:52.110 --> 02:46:52.510]
How do you like that?

[02:46:52.610 --> 02:46:53.850]
Dick Feinberg from Poppano Park,

[02:46:53.930 --> 02:46:55.290]
where we're doing a Wednesday Friday and Saturday.

[02:46:55.410 --> 02:46:56.110]
Let's give him a free plug.

[02:46:56.250 --> 02:46:56.570]
What do you say?

[02:46:56.650 --> 02:46:57.310]
Should we give him a free plug?

[02:46:57.450 --> 02:46:57.570]
No.

[02:46:57.710 --> 02:46:58.030]
Okay.

[02:46:58.510 --> 02:46:59.130]
Well, why not?

[02:46:59.650 --> 02:47:01.750]
They've been treating me great for like 26 years now.

[02:47:01.950 --> 02:47:03.750]
They feed me real good and the fat man too.

[02:47:04.030 --> 02:47:04.970]
How is fat rich doing by the way?

[02:47:04.970 --> 02:47:05.810]
How do you rescue that?

[02:47:06.170 --> 02:47:06.710]
I don't know.

[02:47:07.730 --> 02:47:09.530]
I heard he's practicing because he's been doing

[02:47:09.530 --> 02:47:11.210]
because Jay Feeder got injured.

[02:47:11.370 --> 02:47:13.110]
I heard he was practicing with the old pigskin.

[02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:14.670]
He was working on a football.

[02:47:15.950 --> 02:47:16.530]
Tossing it around.

[02:47:17.970 --> 02:47:19.650]
That's what I heard could be wrong.

[02:47:19.810 --> 02:47:20.110]
I don't know.

[02:47:20.190 --> 02:47:20.370]
I haven't.

[02:47:20.490 --> 02:47:22.210]
I hopefully he'll be able to make it this weekend.

[02:47:22.590 --> 02:47:25.150]
Am I good friend, Derek, which I see V8 one last night, Derek?

[02:47:25.390 --> 02:47:26.410]
Where were you on the phone, Derek?

[02:47:26.470 --> 02:47:27.330]
Oh, I think he's out of town.

[02:47:29.010 --> 02:47:30.910]
Too bad Walling Hennessy didn't call me up and tell me,

[02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:32.510]
hey, you better come out and bet a couple of hundred and nine,

[02:47:32.610 --> 02:47:34.070]
Neil, because V8's going to win tonight.

[02:47:34.310 --> 02:47:35.210]
Come on, Walling.

[02:47:35.290 --> 02:47:35.650]
Get with it.

[02:47:35.710 --> 02:47:36.230]
You hard ass.

[02:47:37.230 --> 02:47:38.330]
How's it going, A Walling?

[02:47:39.270 --> 02:47:40.750]
Don't forget to pant his etch Chicago.

[02:47:40.750 --> 02:47:42.650]
It's been a Walling Hennessy big hockey fan course.

[02:47:42.650 --> 02:47:45.530]
We don't have a hockey team here anymore, but anybody cares anyway.

[02:47:45.730 --> 02:47:46.570]
And you want to know why?

[02:47:46.610 --> 02:47:48.590]
Because his mouth would say hockey sucks.

[02:47:48.870 --> 02:47:49.430]
And that what he says?

[02:47:50.310 --> 02:47:50.910]
Something like that.

[02:47:51.010 --> 02:47:51.650]
Something like that.

[02:47:51.710 --> 02:47:52.590]
Although I never heard him say it.

[02:47:53.690 --> 02:47:54.190]
Why not?

[02:47:54.350 --> 02:47:54.890]
You don't listen to that.

[02:47:55.030 --> 02:47:55.630]
You're just thinking.

[02:47:56.910 --> 02:48:00.270]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60 on a 18 and T.

[02:48:00.330 --> 02:48:01.930]
We got a whole bunch more of this stuff tomorrow.

[02:48:02.550 --> 02:48:04.670]
And I'll check out a couple of these other websites too.

[02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:06.470]
Don't forget to give me those pictures back.

[02:48:06.470 --> 02:48:07.290]
I'll give you the internet.

[02:48:09.430 --> 02:48:10.010]
Oh, okay.

[02:48:10.110 --> 02:48:10.930]
Those reunion pictures.

[02:48:10.930 --> 02:48:11.310]
Yes indeed.

[02:48:11.550 --> 02:48:12.270]
They're filed.

[02:48:12.490 --> 02:48:13.110]
They're filed?

[02:48:13.210 --> 02:48:14.650]
I bet they're filed in the circular file.

[02:48:14.730 --> 02:48:15.450]
That's on our freighter.

[02:48:15.710 --> 02:48:16.430]
I defiled them.

[02:48:16.470 --> 02:48:18.250]
I want to show those to Ma and see what you're...

[02:48:18.250 --> 02:48:18.870]
Who's that?

[02:48:19.110 --> 02:48:19.890]
Who the hell?

[02:48:20.970 --> 02:48:21.370]
She's lucky.

[02:48:21.550 --> 02:48:22.890]
She's going to remember her own name, okay?

[02:48:22.970 --> 02:48:23.990]
At her age and I don't blame her.

[02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:27.590]
12 minutes till 1 at 5.60 W-Q-A-M.

[02:48:28.210 --> 02:48:29.070]
Q-A-M, hello.

[02:48:29.650 --> 02:48:30.470]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:48:30.750 --> 02:48:31.070]
Pretty good.

[02:48:31.430 --> 02:48:31.950]
I'm pretty good.

[02:48:32.130 --> 02:48:33.390]
I'd like to speak to Neil.

[02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:34.350]
You're speaking to him.

[02:48:35.350 --> 02:48:35.870]
I am.

[02:48:35.870 --> 02:48:37.110]
Yes, sounds like me.

[02:48:38.570 --> 02:48:39.830]
Oh, Neil, what's up?

[02:48:39.910 --> 02:48:40.930]
Oh, I'm kind of shocked.

[02:48:41.090 --> 02:48:42.090]
You're just somebody else here too.

[02:48:42.090 --> 02:48:42.890]
No, not anymore.

[02:48:43.470 --> 02:48:45.690]
He's to underpaid to be answering phones.

[02:48:46.270 --> 02:48:47.070]
Oh, okay.

[02:48:47.630 --> 02:48:47.630]

[02:48:47.970 --> 02:48:49.390]
Listen, want to ask you a question.

[02:48:49.450 --> 02:48:49.790]
Yes, sir.

[02:48:50.050 --> 02:48:53.010]
How far do you think that Panthers are going to go this year?

[02:48:53.470 --> 02:48:55.810]
From about here to the wall.

[02:48:56.050 --> 02:48:58.690]
From here to the wall.

[02:48:58.730 --> 02:48:59.190]
They suck.

[02:49:01.410 --> 02:49:02.290]
What did you just say?

[02:49:02.950 --> 02:49:04.050]
I don't have any idea what he said.

[02:49:04.050 --> 02:49:06.550]
I don't know my brain shut off when he said Panthers.

[02:49:06.670 --> 02:49:07.330]
Right, exactly.

[02:49:07.510 --> 02:49:08.950]
I mean, while we're talking about Panthers now,

[02:49:08.950 --> 02:49:10.770]
I mean, they screwed you people and you keep showing up.

[02:49:10.850 --> 02:49:11.670]
You just don't get it.

[02:49:11.670 --> 02:49:12.770]
They screwed you big time.

[02:49:13.110 --> 02:49:18.730]
Oh, and by the way, Pavel Burry, it seems to me in his first big game back after his knee surgery

[02:49:18.730 --> 02:49:20.430]
and then he had a strep throat or whatever.

[02:49:20.810 --> 02:49:23.630]
First game back against the leaves and of course Trevor Kidd couldn't stop a bowling ball.

[02:49:23.970 --> 02:49:25.570]
Two goals and an assist against the Kitter.

[02:49:26.050 --> 02:49:29.610]
And isn't a Trevor Kidd that was open in a big mouth last year about Pavel is he's bad

[02:49:29.610 --> 02:49:31.890]
in the dressing room and he's divisive and he's lazy.

[02:49:31.890 --> 02:49:33.130]
Yeah, right, Trevor.

[02:49:33.510 --> 02:49:36.190]
You couldn't stop a goddamn walrus from 100 miles away.

[02:49:36.490 --> 02:49:37.090]
Okay, Trevor?

[02:49:37.750 --> 02:49:39.030]
The human sieve.

[02:49:39.970 --> 02:49:40.750]
Give me a break.

[02:49:40.890 --> 02:49:41.730]
What did I tell you about him?

[02:49:41.870 --> 02:49:43.930]
Big trouble maker, big mouth, but the leaf organization.

[02:49:44.270 --> 02:49:46.310]
They don't ask me about all these stiffs.

[02:49:46.490 --> 02:49:49.610]
Anders Erickson, Tom Fitzgerald, who used to be good 100 years ago,

[02:49:49.790 --> 02:49:54.470]
who's now making bag passes that lead to breakaway goals by Matthew Barnaby of all people, Matt DeRat.

[02:49:54.750 --> 02:49:56.070]
I mean, what are we talking about here, huh?

[02:49:57.110 --> 02:50:00.730]
See, a Dick Fimer got me starting all this hockey stuff with all of them harness racing names.

[02:50:02.630 --> 02:50:05.190]
Tug Void, Alex Winger, Bucky Day.

[02:50:06.010 --> 02:50:08.030]
Bucky Day, great Bucky Day, baby.

[02:50:09.190 --> 02:50:09.990]
Mike Zafdick.

[02:50:10.950 --> 02:50:12.290]
That's gonna be our pull question tomorrow.

[02:50:12.430 --> 02:50:13.050]
Is Mike Zafdick?

[02:50:13.770 --> 02:50:14.170]
Zafdick?

[02:50:14.790 --> 02:50:16.050]
That's the pull question, man.

[02:50:16.950 --> 02:50:22.190]
I love that thing where the eight man was talking about the Tuckus and the Goyam.

[02:50:22.270 --> 02:50:23.030]
That was beautiful.

[02:50:23.970 --> 02:50:26.070]
And here I thought I was the only one that didn't get a shone here.

[02:50:26.090 --> 02:50:27.670]
And he's up there in Jacksonville at the time.

[02:50:27.930 --> 02:50:28.490]
How do you like that?

[02:50:29.030 --> 02:50:30.130]
I'll hit that one over with it.

[02:50:30.130 --> 02:50:31.670]
He wasn't just talking to you to Goyam.

[02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:33.290]
He was talking to you to red necks.

[02:50:33.570 --> 02:50:34.210]
No, we got a few.

[02:50:35.290 --> 02:50:41.150]
10 before 1 at 560 WQA, we all have different lifestyles, folks, therefore need different products for our health.

[02:50:42.210 --> 02:50:44.430]
Olding and Mediterranean formulas are advanced combinations.

[02:50:44.910 --> 02:50:48.370]
A pharmaceutical grade olive oil combined with vitamins and minerals and aerobols.

[02:50:48.610 --> 02:50:54.590]
And all kinds of other good nutrients, scientifically designed to provide natural nutrition, solutions to help you support specific health needs.

[02:50:54.590 --> 02:51:01.650]
Look for olio meds, three brand new formulas they have one to help you sleep, one to help manage your weight, and of course that great Coenzyme Q10.

[02:51:02.070 --> 02:51:04.190]
I'll be using the benefits of the best olive oil on a planet.

[02:51:04.650 --> 02:51:08.590]
Olio med is an outstanding product that's available at the publics, at Eckert, at Walgreens.

[02:51:46.690 --> 02:51:49.850]
Have a penis. I've never had one. I swear.

[02:51:54.810 --> 02:52:00.950]
A round ol' leather, round ol' leather, different movie.

[02:52:02.250 --> 02:52:07.030]
With your fucking yellow teeth so far apart,

[02:52:09.430 --> 02:52:13.910]
Gondolite's a round ol' leather, what you be doing.

[02:52:15.030 --> 02:52:20.510]
Get the old fascist like that token, schmutz the dog.

[02:52:21.650 --> 02:52:27.010]
Is you dead cause you a hatton, bootly, bleeped, gold?

[02:52:28.230 --> 02:52:33.390]
Is you the black day and some mammere, who be smart?

[02:52:34.390 --> 02:52:39.870]
Does they like how you shine their shoes under leather?

[02:52:41.230 --> 02:52:46.450]
Oh, the way you watch and talk the whitetail is cause.

[02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:52.910]
Georgia Junior say he trust you, can't believe you.

[02:52:54.250 --> 02:52:59.010]
Who's there to highlight on the greedy oil wall?

[02:53:00.030 --> 02:53:05.890]
But then he make you clean all the White House bathrooms.

[02:53:07.070 --> 02:53:11.990]
The cup of seems the toilet and then scrub the floor.

[02:53:13.870 --> 02:53:19.310]
They tell you don't wear sandals, gondolite's a round.

[02:53:19.970 --> 02:53:24.870]
Your cold chip don't help make them warm or wretch and you.

[02:53:26.230 --> 02:53:31.790]
Your knuckle-a-layer look just like it'd be velcro.

[02:53:33.110 --> 02:53:37.950]
It's your feet what you'd be let tokens do.

[02:53:39.770 --> 02:53:44.950]
One day while you be flippin' fat cake, you may realize

[02:53:45.870 --> 02:53:50.830]
That they're treating you just like you're as the roll.

[02:53:52.450 --> 02:53:57.550]
That's when your head will move from side to side, from the lever.

[02:53:59.230 --> 02:54:03.790]
It's a bush and from here they be cracked from asshole.

[02:54:05.770 --> 02:54:08.470]
We're gonna have flight delayed in a Boston, Logan International.

[02:54:08.690 --> 02:54:10.950]
I got a Delta jet there sittin' on the thing on a runway.

[02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:14.870]
Security check. You see that?

[02:54:15.370 --> 02:54:18.210]
Ten issues somebody heard beeping and they said they found some tennis shoes.

[02:54:18.210 --> 02:54:19.830]
Interest some beeping going on.

[02:54:19.870 --> 02:54:21.390]
Oh, I can tell you.

[02:54:22.690 --> 02:54:24.610]
Oh, my head's on there!

[02:54:26.470 --> 02:54:28.930]
Oh no! See if did that again.

[02:54:32.330 --> 02:54:34.710]
Well, it's good. We don't have time for Lee Allen anyway.

[02:54:35.050 --> 02:54:38.650]
WSYZ was a great station at Dave Prince and Lee Allen and Joel Sebastian.

[02:54:39.510 --> 02:54:43.410]
And once upon a time, Joy was there too, which proves nothing is perfect.

[02:54:43.970 --> 02:54:45.850]
It says Pemberpine's porkers read it again.

[02:54:45.850 --> 02:54:49.990]
This time Westbound on Tam Street just before Flamingo Road hiding in the bushes at the Pillbox Plaza.

[02:54:50.490 --> 02:54:54.470]
The speed limit is 30 or 35, but by the time you realize you're overlimited by 10 or 12 miles an hour,

[02:54:54.770 --> 02:54:56.610]
as you come around the bend and then you're screwed.

[02:54:57.470 --> 02:55:00.230]
They've got so many cars pulled over. Looks like a gathering on the lawn.

[02:55:00.690 --> 02:55:04.330]
The other place these assholes are doing is on the west side of Flamingo Road as you come southbound from the road.
