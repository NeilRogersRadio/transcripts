[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.800]

Look everywhere we can now

[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.860]

[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.640]
902 at 560 WQA I'm happy Tuesday too. Well, I tell you got a little bit of a moment. We did have

[00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.980]
Don't speak too fast a little bit of blue sky a little bit of sunshine

[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.440]
And that's kind of like how to know for again, but gonna be a heatwave 43 today. Oh, and tomorrow. Oh strong with that

[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.860]
Nothing I like it. I like it myself you feel invigorated

[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.420]
I don't want to keep rubbing that in anyway

[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.440]
We had a zillion phony votes on a pool mostly this morning. Well, I'll tell you see it's easy to see why the bushmeisters can win

[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.880]
All these elections with phony votes because they all pour them in their right at the end when it comes to most and

[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.400]
Did not look at that total maybe?

[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.620]
You people I got a great sense of humor. I'll tell you that

[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.340]
1394 votes

[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.940]
Remember Ketsan you we might actually reach 1100 yeah, and then we're sitting talking and I said you know

[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.980]
We might actually reach 1200 with all these phony bush votes pouring in here and we got to almost 1400

[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.960]
In fact if we were at a couple minutes we can get to an even 1400 almost 200 in like an hour

[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.540]
If they and they were all for Bush not that their phony you understand divorce

[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.880]
They're hysterical because there's such an important poll

[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.880]
If the 2004 presidential election pits president Bush against Al Gore I vote for Bush

[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.900]
616 now keep in mind when I sat down here this morning at 645

[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.940]
655

[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.680]
Bush was eight votes ahead of Gore and it kind of lead our last night flip flop back and forth

[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.180]
He was eight ahead now he winds up 164 and 18 is 180 votes ahead

[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.440]
Bush 16

[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.780]
Gore 436 I blow my brains out 166

[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.120]
I wouldn't vote at all 96 and I'd leave the country 80 out of nearly 14 member votes some of which a few of which were actually for real

[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.220]
By the way my best thanks to my good-close personal friends Dick Feinberg and Steve Wolf at Poppano Park who sent me something really nifty

[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.460]
I'm not gonna tip the on the on the air what it was

[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.460]
But something really nifty to wear when I come back to town so that I can impress everyone who's not too pleased with my

[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.360]
Apparel with my personal appearance with your gear with my gear. Yeah. Don't bring him into it. Welcome

[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.280]
So anyway, thanks to Dick and Steve it'll be worn. It'll be oh and guess who died. What do you already know? Yeah

[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.680]
What a shame. He was a good actor although we haven't seen him in a long time right I in a coons age James cober dead at 74

[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.820]
Did you see what happened? That a hard hard attack. Yeah, just he was sitting at home listening to music with his wife in Beverly Hills

[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.420]
California had a massive hard attack and croaked fell right over he was 74

[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.080]
He was a great actor. Yes, he was

[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.160]
Mr. Coburn won his best supporting acting Oscar for the 1998 film

[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.500]
Uh, a fiction

[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.180]
Never saw that did you neither now after overcoming a 10-year struggle with arthritis to let one hand crippled

[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.180]
Born in Laurel Nebraska, August 31, 1920 study acting in Los Angeles and with Stella Everett in New York

[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.220]
He appeared on stage in New York and in such dramatic TV series as Studio One and GE theater in 1950s

[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.360]
All those were great long before you guys were born

[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.880]
Great live drama something on her to today. Yeah, what's that?

[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.560]
See in this business about why you old parts you live in the past well part of that is true

[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.940]
But the fact is early TV because it was all live or most of it was live. It was great

[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.220]
You said these live dramatic presentations

[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.600]
Like we just got through same playhouse 90 that was another one

[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.120]
Etc. And so on any rate they played the sidekicks and villains and cowboys and this one and that one and he cashed it on the James

[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.780]
Mania with humorous spice boosts a one arm and flint and in like flint

[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.540]
Such films as the president's analyst which he also produced the second world world world escape

[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.660]
Epic the greatest escape and golden girl etc. And so on in the 1980s he all but disappeared from the screen with the onset of arthritis

[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.820]
He said he'd healed himself with pills that had a sulfur base his knuckles remained girl

[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.560]
Gnarled

[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.600]
Gnarled, but he said in the 1999 interview the pain was gone

[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.240]
They remain gnarled

[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.660]
So James coburn is dead and it just goes to show you okay

[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.720]
He's sitting there listening to music in his home with his wife

[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.000]
He didn't have like any extraordinary thing going on and massive heart attack it like these days

[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.180]
So enjoy it why you can folks because one of these days you're gonna be dead

[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.540]
Take it to the bank. There's Richard Butler on her. He makes me sick. He makes me want to croak

[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.640]
Oh, and I never fact you the pool today did I nope? Well, it's not that hard. I'm sure Eric can handle it

[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.140]
Before we get to all of these things and we got a crap load of stuff today speaking of crap by the way

[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.260]
I think you know we would take a pool on the worst chronic collar of all time

[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.580]
But it's not it's not necessary to be a waste of time

[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.260]
Because Dennis who is obviously listening right now and squeezing himself here his name on here

[00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.620]
You are the all-time chronic not just on this show on every show on every station

[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.060]
Did you tell me you heard him on NPR one day? Yes. Yes. I mean get a life baby

[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:13.020]
Yes, we as those rosary beads do something that he was Dennis it you getting into the rambling mode now

[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.880]
We need you to get to the reason we need you like to cut this off

[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.980]
Let me make two last point very quickly

[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.280]
One time a guy was gonna make an invocation. He was told

[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.680]
Don't use the name of Jesus Christ in the invocation

[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:31.560]
But at that time the man who was telling him that his papers blow away and he said oh Jesus Christ Jesus Christ

[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.160]
So you can use the name Jesus Christ

[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.860]
Jesus Christ

[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.520]
Jesus Christ

[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:46.760]
When we start point now about here we go then he's crying like that might never thing we don't have to look any further than the

[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.340]
Rogers on WQAM

[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.540]
Okay, but if he talked to Neil Neil, tell you that's part of his stick

[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.420]
Yeah, but you know something a stick one man's stick I didn't say I agreed with it

[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.980]
I'm just saying that that's the answer you'll get I know you don't agree with it Howard and I respect you for that

[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.860]
And the day you started green with Neil right?

[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:10.240]
Listen to your show, right, but everybody has their own stick and my point is the WQAM

[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.120]
Trying to see you be a shut up

[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.060]
Nigger's women bitches and everything else. He forgot cool is interesting that we

[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:23.220]
Look at our old backyard, which is WQAMs does the Neil Rogers, but thanks for taking the call

[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.260]
Hey Dennis. I appreciate the the novel. Yeah, the novel is right and that wasn't a very novel experience

[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.540]
So there's our good friend Dennis you ought to have a regular feature on this station every day

[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.540]
You know what the professional Catholic militant anti-Neuroders homophobic hour even like an hour every day

[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.100]
He can pay us he can buy the time and he knows something I bet he would do it

[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.180]
Yeah, a man who needs serious assistance serious assistance

[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.120]
I know this mow is kind of mellowed out a little bit lately. I get the audience probably don't like that too much

[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:57.400]
Because the South Florida audience they like hate they like like that. They love it. They feed on it

[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:04.360]
Now there was an incredible experience. I had yesterday channel surfing in fact some of your most enjoyable experiences come channel surfing

[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.100]
You've even noticed that sure of course when you flop upon something by accident

[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.940]
Nothing wrong with sometimes flopping on something by accident and I'm I was in the middle of guiding light

[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.740]
No less, which I don't know right now. It's so heavy duty

[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.680]
And I flip over during a commercial break to CNN and that awful talk back live show just to see if the world is still spinning around

[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.400]
While still going to be alive by the end of the day

[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:31.040]
And they're carrying on about how Fox News is all slanted to the far right and about Roger Ailes and yada yada

[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.520]
And I got the great story on this for these New York Daily News and

[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.620]
Same things that I've been saying all along

[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.780]
So we'll talk about that briefly in it inspired my pool today

[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.780]
Also speaking of things I've talked about for years and I don't practice what I preach unfortunately

[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.980]
I'm good at talking like losing weight, but I'm not so good at doing it

[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:56.120]
Study finds atkins died may have surprising benefit on cholesterol and everybody in their brother now including that doctor

[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.820]
Gupta on CNN this morning there

[00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.860]
Tell me atkins died. How do you like that?

[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.900]
And telling you the same didn't I say years ago that brought my cholesterol and triglycerides way down

[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:05.640]
Da

[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.360]
That's what I just said. I know I like saying that

[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.040]
Gupta doctor doctor Gupta

[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.180]
Yeah, though he didn't say gupta don't start with that stuff again. Okay, because then more say Jesus Christ

[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.100]
Okay, if he says it and it's okay if he says it then it's because then it's not blasphemed

[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.320]
At any rate here. Here's our pull question today

[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.440]
Which TV network slants the news the most

[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.800]
And I listed them here in alphabetical order Eric so it ought to be very easy for you

[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.800]
Which TV network slants the news the most?

[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:35.500]
Ready?

[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.440]
Ready abc

[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.140]

[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.120]
NBC

[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.900]
None of them or all of them what a magnificent pull again as we touch all of the bases, you know

[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.600]
Even very bonds never touched all the bases the way we do on this show

[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.860]
Which TV network slants the news the most?

[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.280]
ABC

Fox

[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:04.960]
MSNBC

[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.740]
NBC none of them or all of them

[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.820]
Got a heavy of plate today got a lot of stuff of course we might have to take a couple of calls just to pacify the

[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.040]
You know the call of in crown

[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.480]
Might have to take a few of those today maybe

[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.880]
Huh maybe Dennis will call well. You'll see how long that call will last

[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.900]
Do not call us again Dennis. Okay call all the other shows see how long you're gonna be on here evidently

[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.880]
Mo Mo likes the chronics it kills him good time. He's catching on

[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.520]
But don't waste your efforts calling here again

[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:36.760]
Because the calls all and it was my fault was it yesterday what day was it that he called with that crap about the

[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:42.040]
How come you're afraid to talk to people to see we had always either starts out with that or can we talk about anything today

[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.660]
Which of course trans then fact the very first day I started taking calls again

[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.460]
That must have been the day that he was foaming at the mouth. Can you imagine the excitement?

[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.840]
He was probably probably had both hands in his back comb, huh? Are you a think so?

[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.800]
Oh, yeah, he was squeezing himself. He was so excited

[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.680]
Can we talk about anything? Oh sure. Well, what is it gonna be catholic church or homophobia or both?

[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.160]
Which one's gonna be Dennis? Get some help. Okay, like I'm gonna tell this audience for years. There are no callers

[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:13.180]
There are smattering of real callers and generally speaking the base of it is about the same 50 to 100 misfits

[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.800]
No lives people would know like for all who wait for not only a few minutes

[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.260]
But for hours and hours on hold just for their few minutes of fame or seconds of fame on a year

[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.160]
And that clip I played this morning. That was only a very small part

[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.300]
Which is why Mo was getting agitated there was like a novel on the year like get to the point get with it. Okay, you idiot

[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.820]
12 minutes after nine at five sixty WQ I'm looking at Eric wasted no time boy. Look at that on my page

[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.180]
He's already got that up there. He is on top of it, baby

[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.320]
He loves having all those uh

[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.820]
All those zidian hits on a website. What does he make about a hundredth of a cent for each one?

[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.740]
A thousand I think he's got a shirt with Carlos now because Carlos is threatening to take over the website

[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.340]
That's the rumor I'm hearing

[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.860]
12 minutes after nine at five sixty. Well, he needs something to augment that meager paycheck

[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.700]
He gets from QM once in a couple of months

[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:07.980]

[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.020]
They're one of our longest standing sponsors on this program

[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:18.440]
Why because I've been using them in my home for that long they do a spectacular unbeatable job a cleaner or

[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.660]
Not only your crop. It's put your draper in your furniture or oriental rugs

They do uh water damage restoration if you got pet orders like I have in my house thanks to that little book

[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.700]
They do a super job of making them go away

[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:35.480]
And when I tell you they dry clean your carpets what it really boils down to is they make them look just like brand new when they get done

[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.680]
Your carpets are drying a couple of hours. They smell lemony fresh and it looks just like he had brand new

[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.600]
Layed on the floor and carpeting too and with the holidays coming and all those guests coming in time

My and lo this is for 305-60

[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.380]
You ain't kill Nicole

[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.820]
Jesus Christ

[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:37.860]
Oh there is a girl in extra wide jeans

[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.000]
A girl who's head weighs a ton

[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:49.400]
And she's living with the women at the funny play toys

[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.000]
In the house of the ladies

[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]
Reels

[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.920]
When she was young at a restaurant with a boy

[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.720]
He didn't know that she was gay

[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:14.140]
Until he noticed each time they went out

[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.600]
She went for the seafood buffet

[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:25.040]
Just look at all those in stike

[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:31.500]
Sisters now just look what they have done

[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:38.740]
Long minute she comes home from work through that door

[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.840]
Well off her bed

[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.240]
She's come

[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:56.300]
She laid it down to stop publishing the rosy mag left a laid off staff not paid

[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.500]
And Rosie's girlfriend who's pregnant right now

[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.260]
I guess she just only got laid

[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:16.060]
There is a girl with extra wide jeans

[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.200]
And retain her seas become

[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.540]
And she goes by the name of Rosie

[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:31.640]
Oh deep in the house of the ladies

[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.680]
Be on

[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.920]
No, not about that. Oh that's right. That's okay

[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.880]
I 20 at 560 everybody here now again let's set the tone here and see if we're going to be taking many calls today

[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.740]
I doubted anyway because I got a full plate. I got a heavy agenda. This is important V. Tello

[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:56.860]
Morning, Neil. Yes sir. How are you doing buddy? Great. Hey listen real quick. I'm an internet listener

[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:05.180]
Listen always on the internet. Excuse me. I don't know if you know this but on the internet when you guys break for local commercials

[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.520]
We don't get that transmission over the internet because they're listening

[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.860]
Right, but they filled the time with Hank

[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.700]
Hank shows which is not a problem, but they're so old. I mean you're listening to stuff that happened weeks ago

[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.300]
I thought we filled that time with music

[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.840]
No, no, no, no, no, no you've been no it's it's filled with Hank and he's talking to Bino

[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.560]
He's talking to play you know

[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.700]
Yeah, and and you got to listen to it and it's over and over to him

[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.360]
So I was just wondering why for your show they don't put like one of your best local stuff

[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.220]
And you know we get to listen to it on the internet

[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.000]
Why can't we just put why can we fill out with music you guys don't fill it with music

[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.760]
You guys money on with your George is that on our end or is that the Eric doing I have no idea. Oh must be an RN

[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.180]
All right, that's informative because we don't know because we certainly don't listen to our own show on the internet

[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:54.380]
That's what I thought was on our end here at the station and with all I'd say on our end

[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.400]
That's what I think we can verify. See

[00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.460]
Well, let's butch them up a little bit. Okay. It's probably that Bob. Oh, yeah

[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.160]
If he spent less time belly-hacking about screw-in and

[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:08.300]
More time worrying about pushing up everything that we're trying to do make it a little bit more professional and enjoyable for the audience

[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.460]
That's what it's supposed to be. You see as free entertainment

[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:16.160]
That's what it is and getting back to that dentist comments since he's jumping on the bad wagon along with Fox and all the other right wing

[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.020]
Assholes which she you know he is an asshole

[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.580]
Regardless of which wing we're talking about in his case

[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.120]
But the fact of the matter is this is not a show

[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.240]
And Heather I'm sure you're not listening because you already done your deed, you know

[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.820]
But if she would have been listening like I tried to tell her this is this is not a show

[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:35.980]
He can come in a town or or go on the internet and listen to for one or two days and get the flavor of the show

[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:41.140]
How many times over the years of people called it and said oh when I first heard you I thought you were real big

[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.280]
I thought you were real asshole

[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.520]
I thought and then after listening for a while I caught on to it even Moe is catching on now

[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.780]
Which like I said the audience and too happy about that because they want World War four

[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.700]
But the fact of the matter is you got to listen for a while and then all of a sudden you say hey

[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.220]
Guess what that is a stick that is what the show is

[00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:02.980]
And the fact that the show has been on their market almost 27 years now and people aren't like tearing a goddamn building down

[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:08.400]
They understand that they get it whether it's black people whether it's gay people whether it's Jews whether it's fixed

[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.120]
Whatever the hell it is they get it. That's the way the show is okay. It's it's mostly a comedy show

[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.800]
Like I keep telling you we're not gonna solve the problems in the world on some stupid ass radio show

[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.180]
There's nothing to be more ponderous than some

[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.000]
Compass jackass that gets on radio and thinks they're gonna change the world

[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.300]
Unless of course they're on 7,000 stations like fat ass limbaugh or somebody like that who can do a lot of damage and he already has

[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.100]
You follow what I'm saying. What are you saying? I don't know

[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.940]
But it sure kills him good time. No, it's just it's just my response to those people who want to

[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:43.220]
Just tremendous effort to say well and he's talking to a guy that it's constantly saying the same damn thing

[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.840]
Jesus Christ. Yeah, so how come he can say that's okay

[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.960]
But if I say that's like oh, it's the second religious yeah over and over again, you know

[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.220]
Take the Lord's name and vein my ass. Okay. Yeah, good right see what I'm saying

[00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:01.040]
Which TV network slants the news the most our pull is up. We have 84 votes already in a heartbeat

[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:08.700]
Fox 26 those Nazis at Fox those fascist at Fox you're not kidding anybody. I got that Roger Elstor in a second here

[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.720]
You're not fooling anybody anymore

[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.280]
And I never thought I would say it to these certainly not news network over there at CNN

[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.940]
But I my kudos to them for finally butch enough a little bit and strike it back yesterday

[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.000]
Attacking the so-called uh, what what's that slogan they use?

[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:34.680]
Who all balanced? What a fair and balanced oh like I tell you it should be unfair and unbalanced all spin all they because that's what it's all about

[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.000]
It comes right from the guy then bush white house

[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:45.860]
Anyway, which TV network slants the news the most Fox 26 CBS 19 CNN 16 which I don't see that at all. I don't understand that

[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:52.760]
See to me CNN is like vanilla pudding. It's it's not liberal. It's not conservative. It's not it's not anything. It's bland

[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.600]
You find a bias on CNN? No

[00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:02.120]
Other than being anti-Semitic, which you probably enjoy. They're not interested. They're apologists all of them 14

[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.060]
Yeah, right. Yeah, well here goes changing again right in the midstream

[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:16.040]
I don't have time for this Fox 33 CBS 26 all of them 21 CNN 20 ABC 6 MSNBC 2 NBC 2 and none of them zero zero nobody says none of them

[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.840]
Here's a cute facts as for yesterday's pull most of my votes

[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:26.080]
I blow my brains out were from Palm Beach a strong haven for Gore apparently when the mouse pointed to what they thought was

[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.540]
Where they inadvertently voted for I blow my brains out. I smell Catherine Harris

[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:35.780]
That's cute. I like it. I think we can all smell her. Yeah about 10 miles away that bitch

[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.680]
Oh, that's right the congresswoman Catherine Harris or whatever it will she is

[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:47.600]
Roger ails a key media advisor to Republican presidential candidates before we became a hard-charging head of Fox news in

[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.680]
1996 denied yesterday that he crossed the line and offered political advice to president Bush after 9-11

[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.120]
ails wouldn't release a copy of a memo

[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.380]
He sent to White House political strategies Carl rove

[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:02.540]
But insisted his message was incorrectly described by journalist Bob Woodward in his new book Bush at war

[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:09.380]
According to Woodward ails note which rove took to Bush had to be confidential because the Fox news head was not supposed to be getting political advice

[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.200]
His back channel message the American public would tolerate waiting and would be patient

[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:20.400]
But only as long as they were convinced that Bush was using the harshest measures possible and response to the terror attacks Woodward rights

[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:27.460]
ails tried to shoot down the implication that he had advised the president just as he counseled Bush's father in his 8892 runs for the White House

[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:32.220]
In the days following 9-11 our country came together in nonpartisan support for the president ails said in the statement

[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.220]
During that time I wrote a personal note to White House staff member as a concerned American citizen

[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:41.120]
Expressing my outrage over the attacks on our country. I did not give up my American citizenship to take this job

[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:49.980]
If the report is accurate he crossed the line his first responsibility as to his audience not to his president said Andrew Tindall whose Tindall report tracks TV news coverage

[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:56.600]
Woodward appeared to soften the impact of his reports saying though is through his publisher that ails called him and there's no dispute between them

[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.540]
It's a non-issue with this point at the very meeting mouth Woodward is stuck by his reporting

[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:05.940]
Unlike many TV news personalities who once worked in politics ails 62 at times straddle to two worlds

[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:14.440]
The media guru on Richard Nixon's victorious presidential campaign in 68 he later advised GOP candidates for the House and Senate while serving as executive producer of tomorrow

[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.020]
NBC's late-night interview show with Tom Snyder

[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:17.800]
Ha ha ha ha

[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:25.620]
In 1992 while preparing a TV show featuring Rush Limbaugh ails claimed he was out of politics and said his contract with the program barred in from political counseling

[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:31.560]
However, he privately urged Bush's reelection campaign to get tough and help the president prepares acceptance speech of the Republican convention

[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.940]
except for MSNBC editor-in-chief Jerry Nockman

[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.280]
The heads of competing networks to find a comment yesterday

[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.900]
Expressing outrage over 9-11 is a very different story of truth and suggesting ails was offering advice on policy or tactics

[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.920]
said Nockman is also the host of a show on MSNBC

[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:54.080]
Another broadcast execs speculated that if CNN Sherman Walter Isaacson or ABC news president David Weston sent such a memo of people would be clamoring for their resignation

[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.420]
How do you like that? It's an easier thing he knows

[00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:03.520]
So Roger ails you're out of the closet baby. You're not pulling too many except those right wing sick offense who are just sucking up when you give it him anyway

[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:10.480]
9-27 at 560 WQAM Tom Layman and Hal at potty at GMC they're headed again

[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.040]
Maybe they're proud to announce the great Neil Rogers Neil deal zero percent to sail you got that

[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:19.480]
See this is that piece of copy again where Tom practice see how many times he can get my name into the copy

[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.020]
I think it's 600

[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.680]
That's right you heard right with the proof credit from GMAC you can get zero down payment and 0% financing on all

[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.780]
2002 and 2003 potty act in GMC models plus

[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:37.140]
Zero payments for 90 days or you can take a rebate of up to five grand and as always it halfton zero hassles

[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.420]
Don't forget to mention you heard about the Neil deal and save even more when you go down to halft

[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:46.460]
Check out the complete line of GMC SUVs while they're including the envoy voted by motor trend as the SUV the year plus the big gas

[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:52.660]
Guttling Pontiac vibe that's got the power of a big fancy schmancy sports car and as always you find a great selection of dependable

[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:57.100]
Use cars trucks and SUVs and like I tell you every single time I talk about these folks

[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.240]
These are this is a dream for deadbeats

[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:04.560]
And for other people too, but I mean it's great because even if you have marginal credit even if you have lousy credit

Anyway, yeah echo today. Let me start out with

[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.540]
Dennis is a major asshole because you're informative and entertaining

[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.360]
You find out a bunch of

[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:07.320]
Information and I hope you answer this question for me you're in Miami market and 81 correct 81. Yes

[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:12.640]
You're real radio page with all the old radio bits

[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:20.740]
I found one last night. Now I remember WNYQ. I don't remember I 95. I found that but there was a

[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.380]
Station that went off the air in

[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.780]
81 yeah

[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:32.080]
96x and they lost their license the FCC took it away right have any

[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.560]
Knowledge of that or can you enlighten me?

[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:42.360]
Oh, yeah, they were running bogus contest and they lost their license 96x, but I'm not sure is that what what did that become did that become a power?

[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:43.720]
Yep, 96.5

[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.780]
Yeah, I'm not sure what I became power night. No, I'm asking George not you because obviously you're here. No

[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:57.700]
Yeah, I became power 96. Oh, I think well there's a bit on there with them doing the fine off and it was charter broadcasting

[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:01.580]
Yeah, they did a whole bunch of bogus contest and they finally yanked their license. Oh

[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.380]
Thank you very much and have a great day you too now and thanks for the surprise

[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.160]
How do you like that now there wasn't got to have a little something to say I hear an echo on these calls today though

[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:14.120]
You notice that I don't hear it. I don't know not now, but on a call I heard an echo. Well, if you don't hear it

[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:14.600]
I'm happy

[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:19.200]
That's all I care about whether it's on a year or not seven-year-old reports drunken babysitter

[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.660]
Covington Louisiana. Oh, don't you love Covington Louisiana one of my favorite plays they've ever been there

[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:29.540]
They mean either, but just the sound of it, you know, isn't there also a Covington Kentucky? Yes, there is

[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.180]
A babysitter with five children in her car was arrested for drunken driving after she passed out at a rest stop

[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.460]
And one of the kids a seven-year-old girl used the cell phone to call 911

[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.940]
Linda Abert 40 of picky you and Mississippi. Oh, yeah

[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:48.420]
Pick a you and Mississippi. Don't you love them French other names like in a Louisiana and Mississippi?

[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.820]
What I'm not there's something about the whole creole thing, you know

[00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:01.740]
Yep, when they throw all that crap in there, you know, what are the okra okra they slice up a little operas just jam it in the pot

[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:07.540]
Linda Abert 40 of picky you and Mississippi was found slumped over the steering wheel Sunday and the car was still running said

[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.740]
St. Tammady perish sheriff's office said the children were not heard

[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.020]
Abert's blood alcohol level registered point 27 on a breath test well over the point 10 limit the report

[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:20.700]
He's saying deputy said they had to use pepper spray when Abert became combative and she remained jailed on Monday

[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:25.240]
Two of the children ages five and nine were Abert the others four six and seven were left in your care

[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:31.080]
By woman who expected Abert to keep them in pick you more than 20 miles from the interstate 12 rest stop near Covington where the car was found

[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:37.340]
A pastor by the rest stop let the seven-year-old call for help authority said kind of sounds almost a little bit like Susan Smithish

[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:37.900]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.320]
Not that anybody died, but the Susan was kind of like wandering around

[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.080]
Out driving planning what she was going to be doing

[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.780]
Wounding around all over town and then of course her kids wind up drown

[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:58.640]
Democrats question items in homeland bill and this is what I've made I alluded to yesterday when I got caught myself in the middle of that story

[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.180]
That was talking about the homeland building side not so fast

[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.840]
Not so fast

[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:11.640]
The bill creating a Department of Homeland Security ran into a new hurdle yesterday when Republican Senator John McKean announced he would side with Democrats on a

[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.320]
Keyboat yet today to script seven special interest provisions from the bill passed last week by the GOP

[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:21.740]
Let house and I'm going to tell you something if this country if the US of A was full of people are really were activist and

[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.260]
Inuit and like uh, where of what that was going on around them

[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:29.000]
There'd be people marching in the streets and protest here. We keep being told that oh while homeland security

[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.220]
This is the number one priority and yet all of the pork they got in there

[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.480]
I guarantee even fat boy never saw so much pork

[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:42.460]
I don't support a process where the House of Representatives throws a major piece of legislation over to the Senate and says goodbye

[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:47.140]
McCain said McCain switches well as the uncertain votes of a handful of Democratic senators independent dean

[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.700]
Berkeley of Minnesota. They make belief Senator left the bill's passage in doubt

[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:57.280]
If the provisions are killed from the bill a House which left town last week would need to return to negotiate the differences in the bills and pass a

[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.540]
Compromise of one can be reached and that drooling idiot from Texas that field Graham

[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.580]
Every time I see him on TV that the expression immediately comes to mind drooling idiot

[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.300]
Well, we got to get this thing

[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.520]
Thank God he's out. He's done

[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.840]
The bill if enacted would create a 170,000 employee department dedicated to fighting domestic terrorism

[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:23.100]
Republicans in the House and the provisions of the legislation before was passed there last week. They stuck in the pork

[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:29.860]
This Homeland Security bill the bill of president supported was 35 pages long the bill that I've been asked to vote on Monday or Tuesday

[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:35.400]
484 pages long filled with special interest legislation loaded up by the House Republicans in the last few days since senator

[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:40.460]
Chris Dodd of Connecticut and sent Sunday CBS's face the nation. How come nobody talks about him running for president?

[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.400]
Don't know. I like Chris Dodd a lot

[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:47.940]
Of course his daddy had a few problems, but what's that guy to do with him? I think he'd be good

[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:53.320]
Sure better than Al Gore by a long shot. Laws. He's a maybe a little bit too intellectual for the American public

[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.960]
You know too smart. They like somebody more like Frado, you know

[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.380]
Republicans defended provisions as legitimate say they pertain to homeland security

[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:05.240]
For example, they say new liability protections are needed to encourage companies to develop new anti-terrorism technologies

[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.340]
Several Republicans said the Democrats raised the objection because they don't want to see the bill enacted

[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:16.160]
House majority with the anxious Tom Delay Republican of Texas issued a statement saying House Republicans should return to Washington

[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:20.000]
Take on the Senate Democrats, especially Senate majority leader Tom Dachel to South Dakota

[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:28.840]
The provisions as described by Dachel's office would do the following enact new liability protection for pharmaceutical companies that for the vaccines

[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.720]
They make got a Senate amendment that would prohibit the government from signing contracts with companies that move their headquarters

[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.560]
Offshore where they don't have to pay US taxes you following these now, okay

[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:44.780]
Provide liability protection for airport screening companies create a Homeland Security Research Center program at US University

[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:50.440]
And a US University Democrats have legislations written such a ways to create the center at Texas and M University in Texas

[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:55.340]
Home to some powerful GOP lawmakers and Bush including the umptuous drooling Phil Graham of Texas

[00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:03.000]
Provide liability protection for the TSA or for the air to companies that sell anti-terrorism technologies or products

[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.380]
It wrecked barriers to the TSA for the issuance of some security rules for travelers and allow the Department of Homeland Security to hold advisory committee meetings in secret

[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.880]
The move democracy is a gift to corporate lobbyists all this has to do again is with big business

[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.860]
That's what the Republican Party is all about is big religion big business and that's it

[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:25.260]
And guns that's a Republican party, huh? You forgot repression freedom of speech. Well, that's that's all part of it

[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.300]
But I'm just talking about with the people behind them

[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.940]
That's what it's all about big business

[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.920]
And if all you people out there if you're all involved in big business

[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.440]
If that's where your livelihood's coming from then by all means you should be supporting this crap

[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.700]
But other than that which is means of the middle people and little people the most of the rest of everybody

[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.100]
This is a disgrace

[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:47.320]
Talking out of both sides of the rest under one hand. Oh, we've got to have passage to this in the president needs this

[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.760]
A bill that was 35 pages long becomes 484 pages long with all the pork they stuck in there

[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.660]
And then they're belly-icking about how the Democrats are holding up the passage of it

[00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:00.800]
Who the hell are you people kidding? And unfortunately obviously a lot of people. That's the sad part

[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.880]
That's the sad part because you asked the average American person about this and they're gonna say

[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.400]
Just like that

[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.840]
Curities good. Just like that. Just like if you're running into Greg in a hall say how you doing Greg? He's gonna go

[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.200]
Just like that

[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.020]
Some of these might even be real you think

[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.540]
No couple

[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:51.020]
Fox 79 all of them 45 I shouldn't have put all of them on there, you know because that's an easy out

[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.540]
It's a cop-out as opposed to like making a real choice

[00:36:54.400 --> 00:37:00.320]
CBS 44 C-N-41 NBC 33 and it just changed again on me. I hate that

[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.260]
Fox 80 all of them 48

[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.920]
CBS 44 C-N-42

[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.100]
NBC 36 ABC 12 NS NBC 4 and none of them won

[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:16.900]
C-N-SNBCs only got four and you want to know why why because nobody watches it. Oh could that be it

[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:21.120]
So even if they did slant the news even if they were like ultra liberal or like whatever the hell they were at

[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:25.600]
Even if they had like a big swastika on the screen no matter what they were it wouldn't make any difference

[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:30.560]
Because nobody watches MSNBC and I mean nobody I watch it

[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:32.620]
How do you like that?

[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:37.800]
At least sometimes I watched a good show Phil had with Michael Moore and now that was the only good show we had

[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.500]
But nevertheless I was lucky enough to see that

[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:43.960]
And once in a while I see Nockman when I want to see somebody it's better than I am and feel better about myself

[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.100]
And I do like what's his name lester holt you like him?

[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:48.320]
who?

[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:54.380]
Lester holt the news anchor guy. He's good. I don't want you to be seen get out of here. You don't know who lester holt is

[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.400]
How much a Carlos knows who that is

[00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.760]
If I saw probably knew him but the name

[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.900]
You're both you're going back okay get out of banana boat. You're both going back

[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:07.880]
And I do what's in the sambisi and you don't know who lester holt is. He's like a light-complexed black guy

[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:13.240]
I think I do now you said that I think it's a great deep voice come on get out of here

[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:17.300]
Lester holts a damn good news reader. I'm not saying it's a great journalist by any stress because but he's a good

[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.140]
News reader guy kind of like you know

[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.260]
I'm watching that he was lost he had no idea what was going on

[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.500]
Just stick to the script last year you're doing day. I like him

[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:29.160]
There's a few things are like an MSNBC and especially that two to four with my close personal friend

[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.060]
Pat Buchanan and the bill press

[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:36.380]
Can you have I just still can't believe I'm saying that about Pat Buchanan. I like the show. I just like the show

[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.820]
And on a lot of issues pet is much. Yeah, he's right on target. I hate to say that too. Did you hear me say that?

[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:46.900]
I know I'm writing it down you didn't hear me say it. I just thought you thought you heard me say that secret court

[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:51.860]
Speaking of fascism secret court okay is broad wiretap powers. Oh my god exactly

[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:58.600]
In a victory for the Bush administration a secret of appeals court yesterday ruled the US government as the right to use expanded powers

[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:04.780]
To wiretap terrorism suspects that are were law adopted after the 9-11 attacks. You know terrorism suspects like Georgian Carlos

[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.220]
Who don't know who lester Holt is?

[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.940]
You better know your lester Holt mister because you sure don't

[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:16.720]
So the ruling was a bloated civil libertarians who say the expanded powers which allow greater

[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.220]
I'm gonna tell you right now. I want somebody to call in who knows who lester Holt is

[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.060]
Before I continue this story

[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:27.040]
Now it's definitely not going to be this call because they were already on your Miami. Here Miami. Hello

[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.080]
Okay, let's uh

[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.920]
No, not one call on the board. There's nobody watches MSNBC

[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.620]
567 and that guy's worth the dentist by the way the one I was just on there that that idiot

[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.540]
Yes, he is W.A.M.

[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:47.880]
He's kind of creepy looking. He's scary looking. He looks like he's hostile. You but you don't think he's a good news anchor? No

[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:48.720]
Okay

[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.720]
But at least you knew who it was

[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.340]
W.A.M.

[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.420]
Asshole that would a Q.A.M. lester Holt line

[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:04.700]
Hey, lester Holt's great man. I listen to him a lot and he always has that guy on from the army doing the uh

[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:09.840]
You know the magic. Yeah, the strategic stuff about the war and all that

[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:15.200]
The macro. Yeah. Yeah, what's not to like? Okay. Thanks. That was a filled on you calling in. It's not gonna save your job

[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.320]
Feel too late. Sorry, Phil. You're out

[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.120]
Remember the godfather you're out Tom. Maybe I can help

[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.000]
You're out

[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.000]
W.A.M.

[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:26.720]
Hola

[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:32.400]
Can you believe that every line is flashed in the one that I pick up. There's nobody on it Q.A.M. Hello

[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.340]
Yeah, Nioh. I listen to I'm a big emissim. You see follow yeah

[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.880]
Um, do you like Chris Matthews?

[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:46.280]
What do you say you don't like Chris Matthews? Okay. I hate Chris Matthews. Oh, I mean once once in a great while

[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.580]
He'll do something that makes sense, but he's uh, he's an idiot

[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:53.600]
You're list of all still okay and the thing I the thing I hate about Chris Matthews is he'll ask a guest a question

[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.160]
And while a guy's trying to answer the question, he's like starting to talk again like after the guy says like three words

[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:04.240]
Yeah, well, uh, yeah, yeah, I don't like Chris Matthews. He makes my skin drop. Yeah, I like Nora O'Donnell though

[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.760]
Be a she's the best okay

[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.160]
She's okay

[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.940]
How do you like this? We found some people I guarantee you the Fox people may hate us

[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:17.440]
But the NSNBC people like us the only problem with that is there are no MSNBC people see how it is to be in a minority

[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:22.420]
We got to make a coalition of all the minorities you know the the people with one

[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:27.180]
Finger up their ass and the people with the left-handed people and the you see what I'm saying. Yeah

[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:31.820]
All the minorities like the Floridians with an IQ larger than their thumb size

[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.880]
Yeah, I got this story about the Alabama judge

[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:41.200]
I got that just relax look at the look at the writing on this needle. Don't know if you just calm down. Okay, relax

[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:45.640]
I got it. I'm on top of it. I got a pile here all the way up to the goddamn ceiling

[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.460]
So what was the verdict on Lester Hold Lester Hold line. Hello

[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.440]
Hello, yes, sir

[00:41:54.620 --> 00:42:00.020]
What is it? How do you say faggot? Yeah, I think oh, I didn't know Lester was gay

[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:06.560]
Wtq I am yeah, I listen to Lester Hold. I think he's X1. I was mind seeing him going over to

[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.980]
NBC on a lot of more

[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:14.860]
On a partial basis. Yeah, replace that stick and Tom Broko at bad speech defect Lester Hold's got a great voice

[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:20.180]
He does a great voice. He presents himself while just don't know what his policies are but don't really carry

[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:24.180]
Exactly, and you know something that's good that we don't know what are you not when a guy's anchoring the news

[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.740]
You're not supposed to know what his policies are exactly

[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:27.960]
Okay, thanks

[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.520]
And what's the frequency Kenneth oh, sorry Dan. I do like Dan Rader

[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.180]
But what is the frequency? You know, no

[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:37.880]
The ruling was the bloated civil libertarians who say the expanded powers which allowed greater leeway in conducting

[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:42.660]
electronic surveillance and then using information obtained from the wiretaps and searches jeopardized constitutional rights

[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:48.260]
In a 56 page ruling over turning a may opinion by the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court

[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:52.980]
The did you know that there was a secret foreign intelligence court? I had no idea do now

[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.540]
Not even a ten o'clock in you learn something already

[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:03.120]
The three judge of P plus who Lester Hold is they three judge of Pills Court panel said the pay-trudact gave the government the right to expanded powers

[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.020]
That dastardly pay-trudact

[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:13.280]
sweeping anti-terror legislation called the USA paid tribute act and cited law in October last year after the hijack plan attacks makes it easier

[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:18.080]
For investigators and prosecutors to share information obtained by surveillance and searches

[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:24.700]
In the may ruling the seven judges that comprised the foreign intelligence surveillance court unanimously till the government had gone too far

[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:31.680]
In interpreting the law to allow broad information sharing the justice to barron appealed saying the order limited the kind of coordination needed to protect national security

[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:39.320]
Attorney General John Ascroft held yesterday's ruling and said he was immediately implementing new regulations and working to expedite these surveillance process

[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.260]
They're watching you guys. I'll tell you that

[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.580]
George and Carlos okay and Julio

[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.380]
They're watching you

[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:53.980]
The court of reviews action revolutionizes our ability to investigate terrorists and prosecutors to tax Ascroft said

[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:58.520]
This decision does allow law enforcement officials to learn from intelligence officials and vice versa

[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:04.240]
Civil liberties groups which had urged the repeals court the appeals court comprised of three appeals court judges named by supreme court

[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.720]
Chief justice William Rincuist to uphold the court order slammed the ruling

[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:15.240]
We are deeply disappointed with the decision which suggests that this special court exists only to rubber stamp government applications for intrusive surveillance

[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:21.560]
Wants at and be seen of the ACL and you the groups had argued that broader government surveillance powers would violate the fourth amendment

[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.020]
Which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, but the appeals court said

[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:29.660]
The procedures are required on the foreign intelligence surveillance act and they were reasonable

[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:35.440]
We think the procedures and government showings required on the FISA if they did not meet the minimum fourth amendment war and standards

[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.340]
Certainly come close the judges wrote in the ruling which was partially declassified and published

[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:45.600]
We therefore firmly believe that FISA as amended is constitutional because the surveillance is it authorizes our reasonable

[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:52.380]
How you like that broad wire tap powers anybody in there. They're going to be watching you man

[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.560]
They're going to be they got a camera right up your back. Don't ask

[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.820]
To make sure who's being naughty and nice

[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:02.460]
But that's the way it goes because we're fighting that war on Terry, you know

[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.640]
Just forget about all that pork that they try to stick on at the in that bill

[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.940]
We the home my insecurity bill

[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.200]
Right all the pork all the time

[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:21.160]
It's getting it's getting to the point now they're trying to stick so much extra crap in here America

[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.820]
You know what America's dilemma is right now?

[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:27.580]
If I can find it I think we got pork up the butt is what we got

[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.180]
Your own sin

[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:35.700]
With what they're trying to do that home mine security bill America is stuck with pork up the butt and that's not good

[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:37.400]
That's not a good thing

[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.180]
That's what the president said

[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:45.580]
Which TV network slants the news the most we asked in our very very popular pool on earranges.com today, which we're getting a

[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.000]
Just forming it the mouth response

[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:48.960]
Oh

[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:54.440]
316 votes now how many do you think are we all about 20 maybe

[00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:01.160]
Fox 92 all of them 55 cnn 53 cbs 50

[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.580]
NBC 47 a B c 14 the George Will Network

[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.580]
MSNBC 4 and none of them won for MSNBC

[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:14.120]
I think what they should do to get an audience is you just put a bunch of people on it

[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.240]
Maybe don't you if he wants to say and just go and

[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:19.060]
Like that you know in front of the camera

[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:25.320]
Don't you think I'll give you a great idea they could use a news flasher if they had people on the floor channel surfing and they saw people

[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.040]
I'm like that and waiting their arms, you know frantically and flapping their eyelids

[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.880]
I would sure cost a lot of people to stop clicking the channel for a second and you know and see what this is all about

[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.080]
Maybe funny hats

[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.360]
I don't think so now funny hats won't well funny hats on addition to go

[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:45.180]
Mood like that and waving their arms and maybe like some patch Adams noses could might hurt maybe clear about the clown noses

[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:48.420]
And also the little horn clearbell hat, you know, right a little squeaker there

[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:57.180]
You want to get some attention MSNBC you're going to have to resort to some very drastic measures because nobody is watching your network

[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:01.080]
As Harvey Pack used to say nobody had to pick six

[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.540]
At least not legally anyway

[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:08.420]
957 at 560 WQ and the mad dogs coming to one hank is back in town of three

Georgia what is that?

[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:17.900]
George Michael

Pantheon shico prantheir preview 7 to 7 30 to Pantheon's at Atlanta 7 30

[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:25.520]
Any K after the hockey game from GA and Joanne Mark overnight

[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.460]
Thanksgiving baby is coming any day just a few days away

[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.200]
Everyone's flocking to be home together again

[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:33.700]
He had to go out of the table with delicious homemade food and family traditions after all

[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.820]
It's not the turkey that makes the meal special

[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:37.840]
It's the people and the stuffing and the kishki

[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.260]
Getting ready for the hungry guest can be a real stressful theory of the deal

[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:45.980]
Especially if they're staying overnight if you're having a household for Thanksgiving let dollum actress make your holiday preparations

[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:50.880]
A little bit easier now's the time to call him and one 800 mattress and get that new mattress in before the house

[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.800]
Guest arrive if they already told you that they're coming or even if you don't hear from them till the night before

[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:58.720]

Surda Simmons or King Crowe mattress the same day. You know what I said. I said house

[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:20.240]

We're supporting you five six. You a.m

For New York State to California

[00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.160]
Oh

[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.760]
Credit used to scare you on the screen

[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:08.800]
Basemaid just staring wonder

[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.820]
Say I'm glad that ain't me

[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:20.260]
Cosmetics surgery with what she had intention

[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:25.920]
That's surgery did some things I'd rather not mention right

[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.540]
But he lifted up those eyes

[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:35.680]
Stretch your face back in place now today. It's guys at me say

[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.120]
Whether you wait half bad

[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.900]
You were once in a leg

[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:46.620]
I love you

[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:51.660]
You look so new

[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:53.700]
You look so

[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:56.180]
You

[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.360]
She still looks like crap to me. I'll tell that

[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:13.020]
1003 at 560 WQ I am Alabama Chief Justice told her to remove 10 commandments from building

[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.660]
Let's hear it all right my comrade Alabama

[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:23.780]
A 10 commandments monument in the rotunda of Alabama's judicial building violates the Constitution's ban on government promotion of religion a federal judge ruled yesterday

[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:24.280]
Oh

[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:33.820]
Myron Thompson gave Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore who had the 5300 pound granite monument installed in the state building 30 days to remove it

[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:37.780]
More testified during the trial that the commandments are the moral foundation of American law

[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:42.980]
He said the monument acknowledges God but doesn't force anyone to follow his conservative Christian religious beliefs

[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:50.940]
Right a lawsuit seeking removal of the monument argue that it promoted the judges faith and violation of the Constitution's ban on government establishment of religion

[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:54.480]
This is a question of whether they politically powerful can impose their views on others

[00:50:54.480 --> 00:51:02.300]
Sudden poverty law center attorney Daniel lipa. Are you doing the trial before Thompson more testified to decide to locate a monument to the 10 commandments in the building

[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.920]
Shortly after he was elected chief justice in November 2000

[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:11.940]
The monument which features the king James Bible version of the 10 commandments sitting on top of a granite block is one of the first things visitors see

[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:15.100]
Upon entering the building how do you like that? I don't

[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:22.460]
Are gone bloody lost and then of course one of this like I said the listener just foaming at the mouth facts me this length

[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:25.760]
I'm glad I had the charter version of this story the lengthy one from the New York Times

[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:30.180]
Which I appreciate your fact in it, but it just goes on and on and on and on

[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:36.740]
And it does say in Alabama there's no one underestimating the popularity of religion and defiance

[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:42.420]
While fundamentalist and Kansas lost their battle for creationism and supporters of organized school prayer were defeated in Texas

[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:45.580]
Evangelical Christians still set the agenda here in Alabama

[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:52.680]
With a banjo on their knee. This is the state actor. All were high school science books have stickers on them saying evolution is just a theory

[00:51:55.920 --> 00:52:00.620]
Just as more tap right now. There's becoming a figurehead in the movement pushing for more religion in public life

[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:06.440]
The 55 it's what it's called as religious intolerance is what it's called trying to shove it down your throat and a religion too

[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:11.160]
That's what we despise on this program most about intolerant assholes. Okay

[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:15.020]
Trying to shove their views on everything right down your throat making an offer you can't refuse

[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.340]
My way my way or the highway dentist is a good example

[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:20.760]
In fact, maybe Dennis oughta moved to Alabama, huh?

[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:25.700]
Now I wouldn't wish that even on them. Oh, you'll count the Catholics over here. We don't count the them kind down here

[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:30.000]
I'll tell you that right now, mister. We'll send your ass right up the god damn cool. It wants you remember to entry

[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:31.060]
Hey

[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:37.460]
I can just see Dennis up there in the woods, you know, just like Ned baby come on sweet like a pig Dennis

[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:38.600]
Cataboy

[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:43.180]
The 55-year-old judge a former ranch hand and kickboxer

[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:54.500]
Does radio shows helps raise money for evangelical groups and travels roads near and far in his old blue Cadillac promoting his unique blend of church and state

[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:58.620]
Today's decision was hailed by civil liberties groups as proof that there are limits

[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:03.960]
Just as more was elected to administer justice stop to serve as a religious ministers at Richard Cohen

[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:09.440]
General counsel of the Southern Poverty Law Center one of the parties that sued last month to have the 10 commandments removed

[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:14.840]
Justice Moore's lawyer said the federal courts were confused he vowed to appeal the ruling

[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:17.220]
Anonacos

[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.280]
So there you go justice more losers

[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:24.300]
But they'll continue appealing all the way to Supreme Court and then god only knows absolutely correct

[00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:25.400]
God only knows

[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:29.900]
I started to say before my finger slip what's gonna happen there with these Supremes

[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.780]
Which network on TV slants the news the most

[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:37.000]
Roger ails which one could it be all that ails you huh

[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:40.940]
See Heather you weren't fooling anybody at the point. Well you may have been fooling a few people

[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.100]
But you sure so weren't fooling me she was just that doing her duty that's all

[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:50.900]
As a goose stepping member the Fox organization to call and stir up a bunch of crap about this show and have a whole

[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:53.700]
bunch of people who don't even listen to this show like stir in the pot

[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.900]
People who don't even listen to people never heard of me or this show

[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:03.080]
Oh, he's the racist and then like I said at the time the irony of it is that those people are far far

[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.520]
from being like a civil liberties champions

[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:07.920]
Yeah to say the best

[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:12.320]
Some of those are the same people that were like lynching black people like you know five minutes ago

[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:18.620]
But right away they got to come to the aid of condolese and colon Powell because there are house Negro say that's that's what it's all about

[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:22.320]
Although I noticed that colon he's there got a little hot water

[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.000]
He's stirring to pop a little bit too much

[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:31.700]
Which then is the Clarence Thomas learned if you smoke it a little bit that's okay as long as you want them if you stir it

[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:32.760]
Then you got a real problem

[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.420]
How many votes we got 7,000?

[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:38.200]
364

[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:41.960]
He knew imagine what kind of a total we're gonna have tomorrow in this poll can't wait

[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:44.060]
I bet we have at least 100 real votes

[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:47.820]
Which TV network slants the news the most Fox 116

[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:49.860]
all of them 68

[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:52.140]
CNN 58

[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:53.760]
CBS 53

[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:55.740]
NBC 49

[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:57.920]
ABC 14 small potatoes

[00:54:58.500 --> 00:54:59.420]
MSNBC 5

[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:02.380]
And none of them won. I guess if they figure MSNBC

[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:06.520]
Slants the news that's to the left right certainly not right because other than Papu canon

[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:09.220]
Well Chris Matthews he's all over the place. He just makes me ill

[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.260]
I remember that one day I came in and I was cheering

[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:18.520]
What was on one of those Wednesday uniforms in front of those colors kids and he was raving against the war and invading Iraq

[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:23.180]
I mean I have it to agree with what he was saying but he did a great job. Oh, it was that he had John McCain on oh

[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.300]
And we let him have it for a few minutes there. He did a great job

[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:30.760]
So Chris Matthews like I said is all over the place but about 90% of the time I can't stand him

[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.360]
Which is not a particularly good batting average you know what I'm saying

[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.920]
Now some people would say well, I'm sure he don't care about that

[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:44.500]
He cares about everybody because when you got his few people watching his MSNBC does they can't afford to lose any of us

[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.120]
Here's a call from Hollywood hello

[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.660]
You know, yes sir

[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:55.080]
I know who Esther Hold is he's one of the lead pitchmen for general electric

[00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:01.060]
We bring big war to life. Yeah, definitely part of the military industrial complex

[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:05.020]
Um, I haven't owed to the four-year-old. He's got a nifty math there though. You got to like that math

[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:10.100]
Oh, it's beautiful graphics from patient wow it looks so good

[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:14.180]
And you have to be able to help if you have hd tv when they start dropping of bombs

[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:20.220]
It's gonna look like I'm going to wrap right in the middle of your living room positively or gas make I live the war I lived it

[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:25.980]
It's it's it's sad but true especially when you really it's no longer journalism

[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:30.600]
It's really public relations if it was journalism. We'd hear something about Mike Reeland

[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:37.920]
The guy who's been who was locked up in Canada who has been in the service here that the navy even admitted he was

[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:43.420]
With them you can google Mike Reeland and have a day of oh my god. Yeah

[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:45.820]
It's v-r-e-e-l-a-n-d

[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:47.600]
But it's a very interesting story

[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:53.040]
It's reported in Canada doesn't make it down here for some reason. Oh, there's a lot of stuff reported here that don't make it there

[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.460]
And it's but it's about up. I mean, it's a 9-11

[00:56:55.460 --> 00:57:02.060]
It's at the core of 9-11. Well, keep in mind that Michael Moore had to come up here to film that bullying for Columbine movie had to come up here to film it

[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.460]
Because nobody would the finance it down there. It's like it's like

[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:11.940]
Occupied Florida is what especially when you see in the past week that it's reported that

[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:15.880]
Sure, there's gonna be about 200 to 250,000 troops going to Iraq

[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:19.280]
But there's also gonna be about 265,000

[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:24.340]
Reservant and national guard called up to be deployed mostly in the U.S

[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:25.260]
to

[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.820]
Patrol the airports and to do anything else that terrorism might

[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:33.340]
I think they're knocking on you door right now as a matter of fact not yet sir

[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:35.960]
But I do have a note to the port and then it real quick

[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.200]
When Johnny comes marching through your house or raw

[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:43.240]
Here raw he'll treat you worse than a littlely or mouse or raw

[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:49.360]
Here raw he won't use a warrant or even just cause but that one would stop the public supplies when Johnny does the

[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:52.180]
Patriot act march through your house for you

[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:53.680]
Okay

[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:56.800]
Wow

[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.960]
What what he ampere breakfast this morning, huh? I don't know but I want some

[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:08.160]
56705 60 will mix a few calls in here and here like I said little mix and match got a lot of stuff today important stuff

[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:11.380]
We got that atkins diet thing which I know this audience don't want to hear about diets

[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.180]
But it's a little vindication for you

[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:18.560]
There's truly and I'm going back on it right now. I'm doing atkins right now with my iced tea

[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:23.520]
I don't eat in the morning. I just don't eat you notice. I don't eat during the show when I'm not there

[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:26.060]
Right and remember when I was there I was eating on a show

[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:31.980]
Yes, another good reason not to be there if I was still there I'd wear like 600 pounds. I just I can't I don't know what that is either

[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:36.780]
I guess it's just more comfortable here that it's not an eating environment because it's just my apartment

[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:40.840]
If I want to I can go in the kitchen and go in a refrigerator, but there's nothing there

[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.380]
Maybe it throws that's all there is to do here

[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:47.240]
There's frozen hamburgers in there, but I'm sure not gonna start cooking up hamburgers in the middle of the show

[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:54.240]
And then we got filled on he most likely to exit and we got the old Jay thing with the New York Times said that Tiger should skip the masters

[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.200]
Which gets all you guys very upset including Dennis

[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:03.000]
Who says oh they shouldn't be picking on a member if I'm a minority to champion that cause they should be picking one of the people

[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.460]
Who was doing the discriminating well that sounds ass and I to me. What's wrong with both

[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.700]
Huh both BOF Dennis both

[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:14.680]
What's wrong with having Tiger Woods since he was part of that minority that was banned not that long ago

[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:19.320]
By the blue noses at the masters how come he shouldn't be championing for all the other minorities too

[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:25.320]
Then that makes sense to you yeah, but but shut up

[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:30.900]
That's right. Don't be knocking at this is a male club like George Will said that sexist homophobic

[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:34.500]
I'm not just disgusting pig who's the who runs ABC news

[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:37.320]
In fact that this week they used to be this week with David Brinkley

[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.660]
Now wonder david's eyes fell out of their sockets huh? I wonder why he retired

[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:43.700]
I always had tears running down his eye ducts

[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:50.060]

[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:54.620]
He was a country in western DJ. I think in Sacramento and

[01:02:54.620 --> 01:03:01.920]
He came to MSNBC when Jerry notman came to MSNBC. They were really a little like Jerry still all his food

[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.100]
Took every bit of it, but when he first started to show

[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.720]
That was one of the interviews he did and he talked about bringing him with him

[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:15.540]
So that's the latest lester holt update and do you like lester holt? I love lester holt. He's good. Yeah

[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:20.640]
Yeah, he's he's entertaining and I think the reason most people liking is that he's not a news person

[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:28.900]
Yeah, he um, he just you know tell us the way he sees it. He's just a natural guy natural guy. Thanks. Okay. Thanks a lot

[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.460]
Tell Jerry to put the put down a fork. Of course Jerry

[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:34.120]
He's one of those guys. He don't need the fork. So this gummin right off the plate

[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:38.880]
Come on Jerry one less meal today. Okay, please that can's works Jerry

[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.640]
And that guy's gonna explode right out of his

[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.380]
Right out of his gut. Yeah out of his clothing

[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:48.720]
Voice on tape has been lot in the US. Uh, intelligence says it's him

[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.960]
You know, there was like a little bit. Well, we're not too sure. Not anymore

[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:57.940]
Not anymore. He want to of course, it's kind of embarrassing that we have to admit that it's really him because it means it's a year plus a couple of months

[01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:01.880]
Yeah, let's see October yeah 14 months and he's still alive

[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:08.240]
American intelligence analyst said today they've concluded that the voice on an audio tape that emerged last week was indeed

[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:12.080]
Osama Yamama bin Laden's voice and that the tape was made quite recently

[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:22.840]
The authentic authentication of the tape who are not unexpected is quite significant in that it represents an official determination after almost a year of doubt that the terrorist leader was still alive

[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:28.840]
The conclusion follows days of intensive an analization of the tape by experts at the CIA and the NSA

[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:33.920]
The analysis included studies by linguists and translators familiar with Mr. bin Laden's voice

[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.400]
The experts had earlier that the tape appeared to be genuine, but they be framed from saying so definitively until

[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.740]
Well, this is yesterday

[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:46.200]
Intelligence experts do believe that it is that the tape is genuine a white house spokesman Scott McLean said a news briefing

[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:46.760]
Mr

[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.760]
McLean conceded that the genius of the tape cannot be stated with 100 percent certainty

[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.800]
But he said again that intelligence officials believe it is real

[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.400]
Israel is what he said is real

[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:03.320]
You know, that's how he slipped that in or just for the pacified who's born again Christians is real Israel just keep saying that

[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.940]
Until the tape was broadcast last week. They've been speculation about whether Mr. bin Laden the presumed masterma

[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:11.420]
Okay, get out here presumed masterma see see what I'm saying about the news media

[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:16.880]
Everything has to be the alleged like the snipers the alleged the snipers the presumed terrorist

[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.080]
Get out of here

[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.300]
We're all too busy covered your damn ass. That's what it's all about just like this terrorist warning

[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:26.220]
They don't want to raise the thing from yellow to orange because that gets people panicky

[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:31.300]
But they're saying over expecting spectacular attacks because if they keep saying this every a couple of weeks

[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.420]
It's called CYA baby cover nurse

[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:38.020]
Oh, we knew something was coming. We couldn't put our thumb on it, but we knew something was coming

[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.300]
They don't know squat

[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:47.820]
But now that they can wiret have everybody and like you know be hiding under your bed and in your closet and the kitchen in the pop-up

[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:52.260]
Toaster in fact next thing you know you're gonna hit the you know how you hit that thing with a toast is supposed to pop up

[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:56.040]
Instead of toast coming out of there John ascroft's head's gonna pop up. How do you like that?

[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:00.460]
Maybe jostle and elders would be popping up. Maybe she's got one on the toaster

[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:05.060]
Study finds speaking of that what a nice segue by accident

[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:10.540]
Study finds atkins diet may have surprising benefit on cholesterol

[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:21.380]
Quit the starch. Okay. No SS. Those are the evil twins sugar and starch and I just can't stop the sugar about starch with sugar on it

[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.580]
Ah, oh, you know what really gets me

[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.420]
There are restaurants many of them

[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.780]
Especially up here. I don't know what they're thinking about

[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:34.320]
But there are restaurants where you go in and order like uh like for example in the pizza joints

[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.340]
The and down there pizza hut does it all the time

[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:44.880]
They have these specials where you get pizza and breadsticks. Yeah, right. Have you ever heard of such a bad combination in your life?

[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:49.280]
Oh, here's your spaghetti and meatballs with the big side of mashed potatoes and gravy on the side

[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:51.420]
You see what I'm saying there's something wrong there man

[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:57.080]
The same thing anyway, you know breadstick and they give it the same pizza sauce. It's going on the pizza. It's kind of like build-rolling pizza. God

[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.040]
It's redundant. Don't we have enough starch already?

[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:02.840]
It's there would be like going to the pizza lot and getting garlic rules without you

[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.580]
Of course you do because they're so damn good. I see that spots coming up in a minute

[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.900]
Anyway proving once again that

[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:11.500]
Well once every 10 years I get something right

[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:16.140]
I was the champion remember that great signing we had with dr. Bob atkins over to saw grass

[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:20.760]
We had people lined up from wherever you folks are sitting all the way to god damn Jacksonville

[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:28.000]
We had him lined up by the hundreds literally are we allowed to talk about what an asshole he was on that particular occasion yet? Yes, well, what do you mean? Yes?

[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:34.280]
I never I don't remember touching on it. I don't think he was such an asshole. What do you mean by that?

[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.680]
I mean, he's a little store owner said

[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:41.820]
He's a little arrogant and he gets his little bit and he wanted a microphone and he wanted to be able to address the crowd

[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:46.360]
And he wanted to talk to everybody individually about their particular concerns. Oh, let me say this to you

[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.740]
Okay, with all due respect because you're not fed anyway

[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:54.480]
We see none of what you're talking about the fact is that those of us who are fed if we find something that works for us even

[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:59.060]
Once in a while when we're able to do it. We'll kiss his ass. We don't care how arrogant he is

[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:02.240]
What an ego he's got what bad infomercials he did and believe me

[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:06.120]
They were the worst ever saw in my life with those real japan New York broads remember those right

[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:11.820]
How I was by the guy we did works called back to atkins and we buy our products and I would they were disgusting

[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:14.180]
They were like walking ads for anti-semitism

[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:17.560]
They were the reasons that so many people hate New York were the people in those

[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:23.000]
Informers was anyway, but you see there you go again picking on people. I think most goto. He's got he's got you pegged right

[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:28.000]
The mole I hear him talk about you the mole. I think he's got you sized up real good

[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:39.080]
Study listen. I'm serious. I think he's starting to get it. I know. Do you think he's getting it? I think he's uh catching on warming up

[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:44.160]
Well, it's about damn time. Okay, the clock was ticking baby with time was running out mo

[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:48.740]
And all of a sudden he started catching up loosening up a little bit warming up like to the human race

[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.840]
Which I see there you go one more time like

[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:56.560]
For you let me do the goddamn story, please one moment. I was almost time for the break again

[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:00.340]
I don't I don't want to like gloss over this and I know that immediately a lot of dials

[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:05.440]
Oh, there he goes with that fat talking and I know it be on a share of it out of all the things that I could talk about in this show

[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:10.940]
The last thing anybody in this audience wants to hear about is fat and diets. Yeah, no mole with that

[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:15.320]
Because they've heard me fail on this for like 20 or some odd years. Although, you know

[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:19.520]
It's a long ways down from 240 pounds to 193

[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:24.560]
Yes, which 240 was about the peak of the iod days. How I survived that those pictures

[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:28.300]
Oh, man, there were two of you in the same skin

[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:31.180]
And you know what I was on back in those early days that iod

[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:32.440]
Pitchard system oh

[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:37.960]
Yeah, Pitchard system where they bring in the little tiny cans with the real carbohydrate later

[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:42.700]
There's nothing but carbohydrates and chemicals in there. In fact, it's the it's the 3c diet

[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:47.320]
Carbohydrates chemicals and crap. I don't remember who the sales rep was that they would bring you in

[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.100]
It's like a garbage bag for the food. Yeah, you'd come in and go all right

[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:57.300]
What do I do today that was supposed to be for the whole week? What do I eat today because the little cans had about a half an ounce of crap in there

[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.160]
And because of the fact it was all

[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:04.820]
Refined carbs anyway and stimulated your appetite. You eat one little can and indeed eat with the whole you clear out the whole damn

[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:05.460]
covered

[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.720]
And still wouldn't have eaten a damn thing you have about 600 calories

[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:11.920]
Putrid system man

[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:17.800]
So I went from 240 and most of the way I did lose it that time was on the atkins which we'll get to momentarily

[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:21.140]
And whatever happened all our friends like the not slanting lady

[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:24.180]
You know, it's how we made a band and it's not just a thing with a phone calls in general

[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:29.420]
We've been abandoned by a lot of people who supposedly were our friends people whose lives I saved like the not slanting lady

[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:32.440]
I mean, it's the middle of November. It's hardly income tax time now

[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.100]
She's got no excuse that she's too busy to talk to us right

[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:40.660]
Little Joey all those people that used to be our friends remember those good days we had some friends out there

[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:44.080]
Now we have nothing but a bunch of uh enemies. I mean we got a few but

[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.100]
Just not like it used to be and of course the thanks for calling me these. She's on the other side

[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.200]
She's in that great talk show heaven now

[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.580]
We miss her badly. I mean, I thought she said a lot when she called. He was always brief

[01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:57.640]
But she was fun. She was nice. You know, nice

[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:01.800]
Always great which finding somebody nice and south-foot is like looking for a needle on a goddamn Uranus

[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:02.900]
Especially at the road

[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:08.220]
1027 at 560 WQA M Jeff Cohen is going strong. He's not old

[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:12.920]
His ponytail is a lot older and he is as matter fact. Wait till he shows you his fingernails

[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:19.060]
All his painted fingernails and his dolphin member Abilia and Valia and the good thing is he stays way out of the kitchen

[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.320]
That's the best thing in fact they brought some of the people over from the original pizza lot

[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.480]
They brought over to the new plantation joint and the food there is exactly the same

[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.800]
See that's the one thing when Jeff told me he's gonna open up a second location

[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:35.020]
I said you better make sure that it's consistently exactly the same as what people will come to expect from you and it is

[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:40.680]
I can testify to that because I ate there. What now? What was it about five six weeks ago? It was sensational

[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.620]

Still eating people right after you kill them

[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:22.160]
Not even leaving behind a tiny crow to the lecdor

[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.540]
Fingerlick him

[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:32.220]
He cleans if people taste just like chicken if you see the full on the streets

[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.760]
Better honor you

[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:46.580]
Mr. Lecdor

[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.200]
I've got two ass

[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:53.420]
How did you eat things through that funky mask

[01:13:54.380 --> 01:14:00.460]
Though it looks good you can't move your jaw the first animal to you's

[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:02.860]
The still is wrong lecdor

[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:05.440]
I wish I saw

[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:12.300]
You pay up is it up to jabaclaw keep the Clintons on your next

Just remember your Pepsi

[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:18.240]
So

[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.100]
33 5 60 WQ I am

[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.660]
Here's a call from four Lauderdale. Hello

[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.180]
Oh, Nail yes, sir. Yeah nice to talk to you today

[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:30.740]
I don't know if you read in the paper the other day we had a small victory over and co-weight

[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:35.380]
They are caught one of those outcade of bad guys. Yeah, the initials are MF

[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:38.240]
They won't give his name just as initials

[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:42.120]
So I thought maybe in our in a small celebration of our little victory

[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:49.580]
Well, you could play maybe later on at your convenience a big bad black guy named Ben. Okay. Thank you

[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:51.860]
You got it all right. See you

[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:57.760]
Another interesting kind of like around the bend around the bendway. No, not really. I've asked come on

[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.260]
I see your why are you so sour? I'm not sour. I take all the crap

[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:07.580]
And you first you're ripping my good friend doctor Bob all you do have a point. He's uh, he just he's not diet is brilliant and genius

[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:09.240]
But uh, he's got an ego not

[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.400]
Undearned ego. He's not he's got a personality like a dead man. Okay, but but you know you you can't have everything

[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:20.440]
It's like I was talking a few days ago about like if you enjoy somebody's work a comedian or an actor or actress

[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:25.840]
If you enjoy their work, does that mean they also have to be a nice person on top of that is that like a prerequisite?

[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:29.980]
No, they don't have to get you're gonna hang with them like a good store. So what's difference does it make?

[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:33.560]
Not in the mean should I didn't hear any complaints from people that they I mean

[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:38.620]
He sold 700 and some odd books that day, but we had about a thousand people there that day

[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:43.100]
Over a thousand that's exactly right. Can you imagine though if we could have added the weight of all of

[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.060]
Wow, if you could get a miracle the saw grass is still there

[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:48.840]
talk about a

[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:53.120]
Melange of fat. Yeah, it was a melange of moan proud

[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:55.060]
God

[01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:59.080]
But at any rate so he's not a personable guy. What can I tell you?

[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:03.280]
There are people who would say that we're not personable like those two brought some Detroit

[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.420]
Why sure?

[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:08.940]
You wouldn't think that then when you would think by now they both be dead. They were kind of old then

[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:16.200]
No, we can only hope only the good die young study finalize yours how weren't young study finds that kids died may have

[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.600]
surprising benefit on cholesterol

[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:26.360]
And this is what I tried telling you people years ago years ago and all the all these idiot doctors and so called when somebody comes on a year

[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:32.120]
And says that there are dietician or nutritionists change the channel immediately turn on lester whole turn on anything turn on jannon

[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:37.460]
You're more likely to get the truth from jannon Paul that from a registered nutritionist or dietician

[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:38.960]
They know nothing

[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:46.320]
All they know is that american medical association the pyramid with the you know with their fruits and the nuts and the this a bunch of crap

[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:52.820]
They know nothing they have no concept of what diets really all about or what the predictions are all about or why people really are fat fat

[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:53.460]
disgusting

[01:16:54.940 --> 01:17:00.560]
Multitudes whereby the high fat low carbohydrate atkins died and now a carefully controlled study backs them up

[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:06.640]
All right, how do you like that after all this time after all these years after these so-called experts and doctors were poop-pooing

[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.600]
All that it's going to send your cholesterol way up and it has just the opposite effect for many of us for most of us

[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:17.700]
Since your cholesterol down increases the good cholesterol and the LDL a bad it knocks it down a little bit

[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.560]
To agglacerize it nice way down

[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:26.620]
Because you're eliminating those refined carbohydrates. It says here. This is from the Boston Globe. It's in all the papers

[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:32.740]
Low carb may actually take off more weight than low fat and maybe surprising the better for cholesterol too

[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:36.840]
And you remember the thing the scandal about low fat a couple of years ago and it turned out to be a total fraud

[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:40.760]
Which have been screaming for years yes because something is low fat

[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:45.480]
What the hell does that mean if it's still loaded with sugar and with calories and with carbohydrates

[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:47.880]
If you're not going to lose any weight eating low fat

[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:52.160]
Are you needing low fat who probably don't taste you good now that he's dead?

[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:55.480]
You have a low fat. It's a great one. I'll show you. No, but I remember

[01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:02.620]
For years the Actions formula of sparing carbohydrate and you know see they don't want to say we find carbohydrates

[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:06.520]
Here's another example of what the media and the doctors don't want it

[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:12.160]
They don't differentiate they know what they're talking about and it pisses me off, you know it even more than French people

[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:20.820]
For years the Actions formula of sparing carbohydrates and loading up on taboo fatty foods has been blasted with me to many in the health establishment

[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:23.280]
If you it is a formula for cardiovascular ruin

[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.360]
ruin and and remember the channel for thing a few weeks ago

[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:32.680]
Yes, where our friend Detroit balanced for life got a nice free of a whole week of free publicity

[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:37.440]
Thanks to us by the way. Thanks to us Troy and thanks for cutting off the beast you idiot, but anyway

[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.860]
The lady who went on air she did okay

[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:43.320]
She lost the 10 pounds in a month and she continued on the thing because she was happy with it

[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:46.140]
But they have all the people they had on there they did the

[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:52.160]
Well how many different ones about four or five different ones they did hypnosis they did atkins they did balance for life and something else

[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.620]
uh voodoo

[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.240]
Yeah, they were choking the chicken

[01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:01.320]
But of all the ones that they did the Actions guy he lost 30 pounds in a month and was feeling great

[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:07.220]
One of your people I think by the way one of the people works the channel for one of the Julios lost 30 pounds

[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.280]
In fact, we ought to get our Julio on it

[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:14.180]
That big tub of crap good guy, but he's gonna be dead pretty soon if he doesn't cut it out right

[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:18.880]
Sir yeah, it's the audience thinks I'm joking and I realized that this isn't uh fun thing

[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.780]
It's embarrassing to us, but we're fat would choke it on it

[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:22.940]
Christ

[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:27.000]
Even Moa agrees with that Jesus Christy

[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:34.040]
But now that some of the same researchers who long scoffed at the Atkins dot are putting it to the test and they say the results

[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:37.260]
Estonish them how do you like that? Oh my god. Yeah

[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:43.480]
Rather than making cholesterol sore is they feared that I naturally appears to improve it and volunteers take off more weight

[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:44.500]
Ha

[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:51.000]
Still the number of hope away people studied this way is small and the research doesn't examine possible long term ilzer advantages

[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:57.420]
Including how long people keep the pounds off maybe that's why we don't hear from that's not even any more. Maybe she ain't with us anymore. No

[01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.400]
Well, how do you know?

[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:02.080]
Because we would have heard somebody would have well husband

[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:06.420]
Maybe she just turned on us you know like a cornered rat or maybe she gave the way back, which is what I saw

[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:07.860]
And she's too embarrassed

[01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:14.240]
So for now it says the researchers say that much more research is necessary before the Atkins dot can be given across the board endorsement

[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:18.000]
But at least they believe it's safe enough to take into much larger studies

[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:24.360]
So they're starting grudgingly to yield on this and say well, you know what? Maybe it's not so bad after all, huh?

[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:30.420]
At least three formal studies of the Atkins that have been presented at medical conferences over the past year

[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:36.640]
And all have reached similar results all the latest conducted by dr. Eric Westman of Duke University was presented yesterday

[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:39.580]
At the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart Association

[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:43.000]
Long a stronghold of support for the traditional low fat approach

[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:47.220]
Westman and in turn is the doofstide and fitness center said he decided to study the Atkins approach

[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:50.220]
Because of concern over so many patients and friends taking it up on their own

[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:53.700]
He approached the Roberts the Atkins Foundation in New York City to finance the research

[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.400]
Wait till you hear this let me do the break and then I'll give you the results

[01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.840]
I don't want to lie shortchains this okay

[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:03.740]
And I know it's boring to a lot of you skinny people and a lot of you fat people that are like in denial, but I don't give a crap

[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:07.640]
Because we've been on this Atkins thing for what about six six hundred years now

[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.980]
I'd say we've been on for about 75 years since dr. Atkins was 50

[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:17.060]
He was old then you know how old you think he is now hunter and he's still around

[01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:22.040]
Didn't he just recently have like open heart surgery or something like that? Yes, he did something like that

[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.800]
He's doing fine is what we're hearing

[01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:29.480]
And they said it had nothing to do with the diet. It was just his crappy personality the George was bitching about

[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:35.660]
20 before 11 at 560 though. See we can't the world can't all be the way we'd like it to be okay. Oh, why the hell not

[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:40.860]
Well, that's a good question. Let's ask somebody. Let's ask somebody expert like Dennis

[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:48.020]
20 to 11 at 560 WQM. Let's face you've been heard about fast train for a very long time, right?

Need you yeah

[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:06.360]
Car theft is on the rise in America a car is stolen every 12 seconds

[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:12.480]
What can you do to protect your car an expensive car alarm system won't protect your car from being stolen

[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.760]
The club won't protect the valuables inside your car

[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:20.400]
But a big black guy named Ben can get away from the car mother

[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:20.780]
F**k

[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:26.120]
For less than you'd pay for an expensive car alarm system and even less than you'd pay for the club

[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:32.020]
You can get a big black guy named Ben to protect your automobile get away from the car mother

[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:39.800]
It's simple to use just leave the big black guy name Ben in your car whenever you get out and he does the rest

[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:46.300]
Whenever anyone gets within six feet of your car Ben simply gets out of the car and tells them get away from the car mother

[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:53.760]
Listen to these testimonials from people who use a big black guy name Ben. It's always nice to have someone to ride with

[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:57.800]
Although he really doesn't say much just get away from the car mother

[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:05.200]
That's about it. I didn't get a big black guy name Ben to chat with. I got him to protect my car

[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:07.780]
It's the best investment I've ever made

[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:13.440]
My name of it isn't that great. There have been a lot of car thefts. I can't tell you how many times

[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.560]
I've heard you get away from the car mother

[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:20.720]
Knowing that I've got a big black guy name Ben protecting my car. Let's me sleep better at night

[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:26.240]
Calm now 1 800 1 big guy that's 1 800 1 bi g

[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:28.600]
G. U.I. and instead of hearing this

[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:34.040]
You'll hear this get away from the car mother

[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:40.800]
10 47 at 5 60 WQ and anyway this story before I get back to the Atkins and I noticed I got some immediate response including this

[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:45.700]
I got it. How do you like this one facts? I am man with teeny tiny printing

[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:53.180]
Bapapapapib in it and I can't I they was signed but I can't read the signature at the bottom here right because it was chopped off as it chopped up on yours too. Yes

[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:57.840]
I hate to burst your bubble but the Atkins died as a public threat and Bapapapapib

[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:01.080]
We need to go to a nutrition client. Yeah, okay. I'll get to that eventually

[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.040]
But I'm shocked at this thing about a good friend Heather. Oh, there's more

[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:10.500]
There's more one there are another facts came in. I don't know if they're from the same person

[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:14.640]
Okay, well this is from what is this from something people

[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:22.860]
Recently Paul Fari of the Washington Post wrote a brilliantly subtle profile of the pun that Heather nowerts who the HECK is Heather nowert

[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:27.320]
Fari astraterically before the article the answer from most people in Washington or most men was

[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.800]
Isn't she that how does tar blonde on Fox News?

[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.940]
Fari fleshed out the characterization some up but it turns out that's still the right answer

[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:39.740]
Nowert 30 frequently appears on television as a G. O. P. strategist even though she's never worth of the G. O. P.

[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:42.760]
Larger because she's an adequate talker and quickens the pulse of male

[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:47.540]
Couspitados from the time I was 16 she says I knew I wanted to do something on TV low and behold

[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:52.360]
She's managed to become an expert on elections foreign affairs and tax policy and they show too by the way

[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.460]
And if they're a brief stint as I cut the music of DJ

[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:58.920]
Oh did I have her peg right or what yeah

[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:04.340]
Another right wing setup deal she calls on a show and oh well

[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:09.000]
We've been trying to contact you and do a real interview and all that stuff you're playing about pork condolisa

[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:09.620]
Yeah, right

[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:14.100]
All of this crap about fair and balanced let me say it again

[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:20.780]
That's the motto at Fox release should be unfair unbalanced all spin all day all right wing spin all day

[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:26.520]
And they they do it on a bascially now that that dog and pony show she did with us. I mean, I was as uh

[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.160]
Transparen as a pain of glass

[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:34.460]
As if somehow she overed a lot of people upset about well guess what we haven't heard from them all this time

[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:35.400]
How do you like that huh?

[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:39.160]
But what you're trying to do is whip everybody up into a frenzy aren't you Heather

[01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.320]
That's one of the paid guns by rupert murdoch

[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:46.420]
It's not just the Roger ails it's rupert murdoch who also of course owns the umptuous right wing

[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:51.540]
New York post which is a very entertaining newspaper many ways but of course politically is to the right of genghis con

[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:56.500]
Just like the Toronto sun up here my favorite newspaper out of the four dailies by far great

[01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:00.660]
Newspaper except for their politics which are even at the right of the New York post how do you like that huh?

[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:02.680]
Just the way it is

[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.020]
Anyway getting back to the addkins okay in spite of what this

[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:07.000]
Wild

[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:12.180]
Psychotic a maniac. I mean it's one thing to send me a faction disagree that's fine

[01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:15.820]
But if you could see the handwriting on this there's like a whole page of little teeny tiny handwriting

[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:17.760]
Bapapapapin you don't know crap

[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.980]
Because I disagree with you and because this works for so many people

[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:24.860]
Let me ask you this if the addkins died didn't work for people. How could it still be around

[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:30.060]
Right am I right after what 1970 look at all the other one

[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:33.560]
That's right it started in the early 70s and 72 or three is the first time I did it

[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.200]
That's when I lost a hundred pounds as a matter of fact on these stillman and the addkins diets

[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:42.680]
Right all the other of bad diets that come and go if they don't work for people hey

[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:45.120]
They're gone in a heartbeat remember when you took that poll

[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:52.280]
Anybody taken liquid protein lately? No, no, nobody drinking that no I mean look at all the 80 trillion different diets

[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.120]
That have come and gone in that period of time

[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:57.240]
How about our herbal life friend? Oh, he's still dead

[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.560]
By the products by the products

[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:08.160]
Westman studied 120 overweight volunteers who were randomly assigned to the addkins diet or the heart associations

[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:14.880]
Step one diet a widely used low fat approach on the addkins diet people limited their carbs to less than 20 grams a day

[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.460]
And 60% of their calories came from fat. It was high fat off the scale. He said

[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:24.260]
After six months the people on addkins diet had lost 31 pounds. This is the average

[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.440]
Compared with 20 pounds on the American Heart Association diet and more people stuck with the addkins regimen

[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:36.620]
Total cholesterol fell slightly in both groups however those on the addkins diet had an 11% decrease in H

[01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:37.800]
DL the good cholesterol

[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:45.160]
Everybody let me sit again the addkins had an 11% increase in H DL the good cholesterol and 49% drop in triglycerides

[01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:52.500]
On the AHA diet H DL was unchanged and triglycerides dropped 22% high triglycerides may raise the risk of heart disease

[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:58.360]
Let me say it again American Heart Association diet they dropped 22% on the average addkins 49%

[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.900]
And I remember the first couple of months I did addkins my and you remember those days

[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:05.660]
I was having my blood drawn like you'd be five minutes

[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:11.880]
But uh my triglycerides dropped from 300 to 80 in about a month or two on addkins

[01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:16.780]
While the volunteers total amounts of L the L the bad cholesterol didn't change much on either diet

[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:21.060]
There was evidence that it had shifted to a form that maybe less likely to clog the arteries

[01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:29.520]
More study is necessary because such a diet can be recommended Westman said however concerned about serum lipid cholesterol elevations should not impede such research

[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:34.640]
And that was the big objection. Oh you're gonna eat all that fat your cholesterol is gonna go zooming up and now they say oh

[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:35.760]
Guess what? We don't think so

[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:39.860]
Some people it does because everybody's system is different, but most people it does not

[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:45.700]
It says no single studies likely to change minds on the issue especially since an initial weight loss is hard to maintain on any diet

[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:49.580]
Some answers could come from a year-long study being sponsored by the National Institutes of Health

[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:55.160]
That experiment being directed by Dr. Gary Foster the University of Pennsylvania will test the atkins data on 360 patients

[01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:03.620]
In the meantime the heart association president Dr. Robert Bonel of Northwestern University said the organization will reconsider the atkins

[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:05.980]
Dytasame as more research results become available

[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:10.440]
Having our top academic centers look at this as wonderfully said we're still leading with small numbers of patients

[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:16.120]
We just need more data doctor Sydney Smith the heart associate and research director said it was a surprise that the atkins

[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:20.300]
Dr. Not raise LDL cholesterol one small study like this flies the face of so much evidence

[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:23.000]
We can't change dietary recommendations on the spot. He said

[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:29.980]
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein a nutrition expert at Tufty University said she thinks too much is made at the amounts of carbohydrates and fats and people's

[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:34.220]
Dineses they try to should wait she said there's no magic combination of fats versus carbs versus protein

[01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:38.480]
It doesn't matter in the long run the bottom line is calories calia. She's a nutrition expert

[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:40.680]
Calories calories calories

[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:44.480]
Do you believe that nope no

[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:49.860]
Because let's say this let's say if he had like uh two hamburgers to

[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:56.100]
And let's say there's two big steaks one for lunch and one for dinner and then small amounts of protein through the rest of the day and a little bit of carbs

[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:59.120]
And he had exactly the same number of calories in refined sugar

[01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:02.680]
Even nothing but candy bars and

[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:06.480]
Crispy creams all day for the same calories. Yeah

[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:09.880]
I wish you think your body's gonna function better on

[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:10.640]
duh

[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:11.460]
Yeah

[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:14.880]
Anyway, this one about I hate to burst your bubble. This thing goes on so long

[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:18.920]
You might have weighed Janet and a Hollywood. What is it? What is this facts all about is Janet doing drugs or what?

[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.340]
I mean, what is this?

[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:25.440]
It's hello Neil. I'm an avid listener and enjoy all your shows whether without the phone calls

[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:29.700]
Love to hear you talk about all of the great spots in Las Vegas when you're gonna go out there when you return

[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.380]
You'll have lots of new stuff to talk about

[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:35.460]
Great show Janet. Huh. What does that mean? I don't know

[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.300]
When you go out there, you'll have lots of new stuff to talk about. I'm not going out there Janet. I've already left

[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:41.760]
My contribution

[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:48.140]
It's too damn far when you realize that you can get on a plane and go into Europe and just slightly more time

[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:50.880]
Then it takes to fly from the east coast all the way out there to Vegas

[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:56.960]
I've just I've killed as many casinos as I can with my money and I love it and it's fun and y'all

[01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:00.340]
I'm just burned out on it now. Maybe in a year or two. I'll change my mind about that

[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:06.460]
Also, she says PS how about playing Robby are young rants. No, but have an ice-tail Janet. Thank you

[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:07.560]
boy

[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.280]
wild

[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:14.980]
Field on a hue most likely to exit states like how's that pull coming on uh slated news, huh?

[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.780]
Which TV network slants the news the most?

[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:22.180]
We got 45 billion votes 481

[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:29.760]
Fox 162 all of them 95 CNN 72 CBS 66

[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:31.760]
NBC 61

[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.300]
ABC 17

[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:37.740]
MSNBC with nobody watches six and none of them only two only two people out there

[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:40.860]
Out of almost 500 say oh nobody slants the news

[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.940]
Field on a hue most likely to exit states left

[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:48.260]
Did I predict this? Yes

[01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:50.660]
This is from USA today

[01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:56.460]
Field on a hue's days in MSNBC are numbered and you don't need to go into double digits. I don't think

[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:00.800]
NBC news executives under pressure from corporate owner general electric to

[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:03.360]
Providing's are like the the cancel is talk show by years end

[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.840]
If Donahue gets the acts it'll be the strongest indication yet that star power alone does make you hit on the cable

[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:12.320]
And that with a variety of viewing options available cutting it there is tough

[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:18.800]
Donahue was the subject of a biting NBC centered in our live parody Saturday in which Darryl ham and played the liberal talk show host

[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:22.920]
When you when you where your own network starts goofing on you watch out it says

[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:28.800]
MSNBC averaging 392,000 viewers in prime time is a ratings embarrassment for GE

[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:32.000]
Fox News channel draws 1.5 million viewers and CNN

[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.760]
983,000

[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:38.820]
Donahue the king of syndicated daytime talk in the 70s and 80s kicked off his MSNBC gig in July

[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:44.740]
What are they faced an uphill fight? I go to this fully knowing the challenge he told USA today. I want to be a player

[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:48.360]
By September with this program virtually ignored by cable audiences

[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:52.800]
He was telling MSNBC's Jerry Nockman that unless he made noise by January he'd be out

[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:56.860]
The North Final decision has been made executives of told him his chances are slim

[01:33:56.860 --> 01:34:04.180]
Unless his program which is running a distant third behind top rated O'Reilly factor on Fox and CNN's Connie Chink tonight can show dramatic improvement

[01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:08.540]
Executives doubt that's going to happen if somebody off Donahue stature can't cut it after five months

[01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:13.540]
They doubt he ever will last week and a move designed to improve ratings Donahue left MSNBC studios and see cocks in New Jersey

[01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:19.700]
To return to the scene of his glory days man hatons rock a fellow senator who shows before a lost studio audience that continues this week

[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:23.940]
And then it's got question mark new gigs for mar and Ling

[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:25.780]
Who hell is Ling

[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:29.040]
Donahue Alisa Ling

[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:33.780]
Bill Mahar was on at the end of that show yesterday that talk back life. He's pathetic

[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:39.620]
He's written a stupid ass book about if you ride alone you ride with bin Laden about in other words if you don't carpool

[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:41.120]
You're oh it's he's just

[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:47.740]
Looks like he weighs about 40 pounds now. I guess he ain't eaten so good anymore. What a nebbage. Yeah, or a never-neb

[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:50.800]
That's exactly the word for him. He's a real nebbage no talent puss

[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:55.580]
1057 at 560 WQ I am here something that's good for you

[01:34:55.580 --> 01:35:01.340]
There's not too much debate about this and that olive oil is a great the thing people shmir it on their feet on their arm

[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:04.740]

[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:08.460]

[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:00.780]
So anyway, Heather now works this original story by Paul Farrell

[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:03.480]
Washington Post that right this is May 25, 2000

[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:06.840]
Yes, so like a long time ago by one of our regular

[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:10.800]
Facts as long as we appreciate and I'm not going to read it. I mean it's much much too long

[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.820]
But it talks about how she bounced around from

[01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:16.620]
Right sous-city to see the rapids and on every she was on MSNBC

[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:20.040]
And BBC and CNBC and PBS and ABC and

[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:22.000]
Instead of and so on shout-ditions for movies

[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.840]
Right, but she's a nothing

[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.140]
It says then it happened

[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:27.340]
Well, wait until you get to the one part which I've

[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:30.080]
Called out of this to give you a real good idea of how she's

[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:33.360]
I got it. No, no, no, no, that's coming about kind of Lisa

[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:38.080]
After bouncing around all these years then it happened Monica the Clinton-Lewinsky

[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:40.900]
Scandal created full employment for pundits of all straps but in particular

[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:44.660]
Give wide visibility to a subset of young female conservatives and culture

[01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:49.100]
Laura Ingram, Barbara Olson, Kelly Antfitts Patrick, and Heather Newert

[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:52.620]
With cable networks filling the air with talk about sex and sexual harassment

[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:55.500]
The pundits as they came to be known filled a market need

[01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:58.440]
A telegenic group of women who were predictably anti-clinton

[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.640]
And in their own way they were breakthrough figures

[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:01.780]
Now

[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:06.420]
They're good. This part where she's on with the so let's see last month

[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:10.500]
It would have been April of 2000. It says asked by Fox News host Bill O'Rider

[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:14.260]
Last month to make the case for George W. Bush's presidency for example

[01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:15.880]
Newert offered this

[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:20.420]
The general philosophy that Governor Bush has is that America's great because of its people

[01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:24.720]
Because of America's innovation because of our generosity because of our entrepreneurial spirit

[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:27.480]
Al Gore believes that America's great simply because of the government

[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.640]
I think what's important is that we need a vision

[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:33.940]
A leader needs a vision leader needs to be able to point very qualified people to his or her cabinet

[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:34.800]
Why?

[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.060]
A rally asked?

[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:37.180]
Newert stumbled

[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:44.480]
There's one gal. I forget her name. She's an African-American gal and she's involved. A rally says, Candelisa Rice

[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:47.600]
Newert says exactly and she does foreign policy

[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:50.960]
She didn't even know her name

[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:53.560]
Wow. She does foreign policy. She is sharp

[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:58.720]
And I think people with people like that and through having had the experience of knowing people through his father's administration

[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:01.360]
That it can help bring some of these people into his core group

[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.320]
Oh my god

[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:06.200]
Yeah, what a fumbling bubble

[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:09.600]
A bin bed in that. Yeah, absolute bin bed is what she is

[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.660]
And she's called an issue because it's part of the right wing agenda

[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:16.580]
Not only a fox I'm sure she had a lot of encouragement from there but of her own leanings

[01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:19.120]
Oh yeah, we saw this on newsmax.com

[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:23.100]
Let's call up that show and expose this side of a bitch for the racist piece of crap that he really is

[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:24.700]
And let's make a big simiside of it, okay?

[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:28.340]
A big dog and pony show, especially right before election time

[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:35.080]
Didn't have any idea who I was, what the show was all about, etc. and so on

[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:39.520]
But make a big stink because we can smell it all the way up here Heather

[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:40.900]
Bim bed

[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:47.220]
Which TV network slants the news the most we yesterday on eorogers.com?

[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:49.660]
We got 42 billion votes

[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:53.860]
500 exactly, look at that. We're not in a propitious time to take a look at it

[01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:56.140]
500 at 11 o'clock, can you believe that?

[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.920]
I've got you at least 10 of more real votes

[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:04.980]
Fox 172 all of the 98 CNN 74 CBS 68

[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:10.600]
66 NBC 62 ABC 18 see what a big drop off there

[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:13.380]
I don't think anybody even watches ABC news

[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:16.880]
MSNBC 8 and none of them two

[01:41:18.540 --> 01:41:19.140]
Shocking

[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:25.380]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

Here's Miramar hello

[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:30.900]
Miramar gone

[01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:33.340]
You be there

[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:36.980]
Miramar I hear you're clicking

[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:38.180]
Yeah, that's the real one

[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:40.180]
Oh, it's one of those quiteers, yeah, it's just the quiet guy

[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:43.220]
Okay, so there's no calls on the board, all you people are wanted calls back

[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:47.640]
I mean we sure haven't discussed anything, you know, worth eliciting your call today, have we?

[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:50.260]
No good, so let's just continue plodding right ahead

[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.360]
Sending a powerful message

[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:56.680]
New York Times suggests that Tiger should skip the masters

[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:02.500]
The New York Times suggested an editorial yesterday that Tiger would skip the masters next year

[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:05.820]
because of the all-male membership at Augusta National Golf Club

[01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:11.020]
A tournament without Mr. Woods would send a powerful message that discrimination isn't good for the golfing business

[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:13.660]
The editorial said Augusta National declined comment

[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:16.080]
Now let me just interrupt my reading of this article to point out

[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:21.480]
that those people who keep poo-pooing the women's efforts to force their way into Augusta

[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:23.900]
would keep saying that Moe always says this every morning

[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:25.920]
Well, why do these women work on other important things?

[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:29.840]
There are a lot more important issues that they need to be addressing than whether or not they're letting into some golf club

[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:34.540]
Right, the same could have been said about blacks

[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:39.640]
The same could be said about any minority group who always have much bigger fish to fry

[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:44.060]
But what a lame excuse it is to say, oh, why don't you just go away and leave us alone

[01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:45.320]
which is really what's being said

[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:48.860]
You have a lot more important important issues than worrying about this

[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:50.920]
Am I right?

[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:54.440]
No matter what the group is

[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:59.680]
But that's a pretty sorry ass excuse for being a sexist, a leadist bunch of blue nose assholes

[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:01.280]
Which is really what this is all about

[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:08.300]
In interviews this month Augusta National Chairman Hooney Johnson was adamant that a woman would not be among the 300 members

[01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:10.220]
at Augusta by the start of the Masters in April

[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:15.380]
Johnson's comments were the first on the subject since he criticized Martha Burke and the National Council

[01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:18.100]
Bracially discriminated against women

[01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:21.680]
Which means others can choose not to support Mr. Johnson's golfing fraternity

[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.900]
That includes more enlightened members of the club CBS sports which televises the Masters and the players, especially Tiger Woods

[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:34.800]
The editorial said, sandford I whale wheel the chief executive of City Group and Kenneth Shenalt chairman of the American Express

[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:37.400]
Should lead the way for other prominent members and resign from the club

[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:42.940]
While in Shenalt have said Augusta National should admit female members they did not immediately be turned calls he can come on yesterday

[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:47.840]
Woods was headed to this week's Dermal Phoenix term in Japan and not immediately available for comment

[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:52.020]
He said he would like to see a female member at Augusta National but that the club has the right to set up its membership

[01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:56.560]
However it wanted in other words if we know like Taiwan, he's people if we know like black people you're out the Tiger

[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:00.820]
Which obviously they wouldn't do but what kind of crap is that?

[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:05.840]
CBS will broadcast the Masters in April CBS sports vice president Langley had wades

[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:07.700]
Leslie and Wade said declining for the comment

[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:13.840]
The notebook has a series of one year deals since 1956 televised the Masters the highest rated golf tournament

[01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:19.000]
And Mo was right about that there many other more important issues but the fact is that this is an issue

[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:21.100]
It's kind of like Rosa Parks

[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:26.780]
Why you wait about where you sit on the bus Rosa black folks we got a lot more important things to worry about than that

[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.580]
Does that make any sense?

[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:31.080]
No, the boss knows the boss

[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:33.920]
Exactly very well put

[01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:36.660]
What kind of crap is that?

[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:41.100]
And Tiger Woods if he had any real balls himself he would say hey guess what?

[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:46.460]
My people used to be discriminated against if it weren't for the fact that somebody broke through that barrier against black people being in Augusta

[01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:49.620]
Because there's a bunch of blue nose bigots running on the thing I wouldn't be here today

[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:52.520]
I would be wearing those stupid green jackets

[01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:56.180]
And women should be in there and anybody else that wants to be in there

[01:44:56.180 --> 01:45:01.240]
This reminds me of the Kennelworth Hotel in those ugly days back in the 50s and 40s on Miami Beach

[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:06.700]
No blacks allowed no Jews allowed and I'm sure no spits allowed by the way you guys sure that

[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:16.360]
And then overwhelmingly on this radio station being the sports all male fraternity sports niffs station

[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:20.120]
All in all these women he's bull dice man he just better leave us alone

[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:22.220]
Leave us alone let us have our fun

[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:24.300]
Freedom of association

[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:29.480]
Here's Port Saint Lucie our only call hello

[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:31.160]
Any a couple quick things

[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:35.400]
First off I'm sort of surprised in your poll that you didn't include one of the financial networks

[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:39.080]
That you're always complaining about flanting the news how they invented it you know what I'm saying?

[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:41.280]
No

[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:46.420]
Well you know how they're always reporting on you know sponsors and giving them favorable ratings

[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.740]
That's flanting the news

[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:53.760]
No that's not signing news though those aren't news stories those are that that's lying to the public

[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:55.320]
That's just bloody the line of the public

[01:45:55.320 --> 01:46:00.200]
It was news but on my second point I mean I sort of agree with you talking about about Augusta

[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:07.360]
But what would happen if a guy tried to join the women's NBA or what would happen if a guy tried to go out for his girls volleyball team

[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:08.900]
Because they didn't offer boys volleyball

[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:12.440]
What you can't say for this though what no no I'm not

[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:15.480]
Well then how come the you're in favor of the reverse I don't know

[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:20.800]
Because this is a this is a club okay the women aren't saying that they ought to play in a matches golf tournament

[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:22.500]
They're saying that they want to be members of the club

[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:28.820]
They're not allowed to join the club they're not saying that they want to play in a men's tournament at least as I understand it

[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:33.820]
The difference between the bus that was a public bus and this is a private club I really can't agree with you

[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:35.140]
I mean I think they're schmogs

[01:46:35.140 --> 01:46:37.080]
So so I think they have a way to make it wait a minute

[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:42.260]
Wait a minute that was the same reasoning that they used to exclude blacks how come everybody forgets that

[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:47.740]
I'm not saying that they're good people I think they're jerks but they have a right to be jerks

[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:52.180]
So it's not the way they want if they want if they're way for the we're not tired woods around today

[01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:55.600]
If he wasn't a leading golfer in the world there wasn't so popular and didn't make them so much money

[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:59.100]
If he didn't exist you're saying that if they wanted to exclude blacks it would still be okay

[01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:01.920]
I'm saying I don't agree with it but that'd be well within their right

[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:04.680]
And I think the only thing you could do to them from a government standpoint

[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:08.700]
Is probably not give them a liquor license they'd make less money if they're bar

[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:12.180]
But as far as they're missing you're missing you have to put the point

[01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:14.160]
There's nobody saying that it isn't their right to do it

[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:19.640]
But they're saying that CBS and the other sponsors who are associated with them shouldn't support them until they stop discriminating

[01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:24.780]
Well that's up to CBS I mean everything comes down to freedom of choice

[01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:29.560]
I mean CBS has the right to choose whether they want to be affiliated with a court that's a bunch of jerks like that

[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:30.700]
Yeah well I'm going to be happy

[01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:35.200]
What do you agree with somebody's freedoms or not they should still have the freedom to choose

[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:40.340]
Well it's a very blatantly bigoted and ugly thing I'll take it that

[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:41.300]
No questions

[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:42.480]
Okay thanks

[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:49.000]
12 minutes after 11 and 560 WMQ I'm infected to see those female golfers speaking ablately ugly

[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:50.260]
Yeah

[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:55.280]
Now who that was the guy in CBS that got canned because he made that dark comment

[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:56.800]
What that was the call commentator?

[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:57.940]
Whatever the hell is name right?

[01:47:58.520 --> 01:47:59.940]

2-1

[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:11.260]
4-1-2

[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:15.120]
What a shock

[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:24.020]
What's the matter with lesbian golfers can't you tell we really love hidden malls

[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:30.940]
The only thing that separates us from the men is the country clubs bathroom stalls

[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:38.860]
I let my girlfriend call sir Patty choose the fair on the birth sheet called daddy

[01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:44.760]
Must die that five-tuney taco alright still ladies golf to me

[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:52.940]
My favorite holder doesn't have any number agree or a fairway

[01:49:54.640 --> 01:50:00.380]
No, it's wet because I'm a snapper lapper I play golf and I'm gay

[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:05.180]
I'm a key time guy caught in the clubhouse

[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:08.580]
Let's be golf is the only time with the girls

[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:14.180]
I'm gay let's play LPG A still ladies golf to me

[01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:19.120]
And right is this grey chick sit on my face

[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:21.320]
It's the latest golf to me

[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:28.000]
11-18-5-60 WQ and we don't want no dikes in here. I'll tell you that that's for damn sure not in my gus

[01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:28.740]
Oh

[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:36.240]
This guy that sent me or whoever in hell is was this long pond respects about atkins and I'm full of Schmidt and this and that and about his percentage of how many carbs

[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:44.900]
The fact that he doesn't this specify he says 65% carbs 10 to 20% proteins and approximately 15% fat

[01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:49.860]
When he doesn't specify is talking about unrefined carbohydrates he doesn't know what he's talking about

[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:56.560]
So thanks for wasting all of that time and effort and ink that you put on the appaids there but blow it out your ass

[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:03.020]
For example here's the fact that says one of my co-workers weighed 280 pounds in February today is 214 he's off all his medication

[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:06.100]
The atkins died is the best from somebody in halandale

[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:06.900]
Oi!

[01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:07.680]
How do you like that?

[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:09.360]
You forgot to mention that as well

[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.580]
The if you're diabetic factor

[01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:12.260]
Right

[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:19.600]
If you're diabetic it's one of the best ways because you're not eating those be fine carbohydrates that sent your blood sugar soaring all the time

[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:26.760]
And you can get your blood sugar under control without any if you're one of those people that takes oral medication like I do for blood sugar control

[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:29.200]
You can stop taking it all together

[01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:37.900]
Because the the atkins diet or diets like that the low-refin carbohydrate diet is the perfect way to keep your blood sugar under control

[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:39.820]
But then again we got everybody's an expert

[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:46.860]
See unless you've been through it yourself unless you personally test your blood pressure your blood sugar unless you like taking control of things like that

[01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:48.120]
You know what you're talking about

[01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:53.860]
I'm doing it I'm starting it today how long you think the last?

[01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:56.520]
Uh, till the end of the day, now or clock?

[01:51:57.060 --> 01:52:01.760]
I'm doing it starting today okay for the 8 billion time nobody wants to hear about it that's okay I'm fat

[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:06.820]
Not like I used to be though there's a great story this one from the Milwaukee magazine that's gonna be fact in

[01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:13.520]
Somebody yes it says a sizable concern on the day Timothy Dolan was installed as the new archbishop here

[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:20.700]
Joyful music filled St John the Evangelist evangelist walk and I read because I'm so anxious to get to the part

[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:27.040]
Joyful music filled St John the evangelist cathedral and live media coverage kept to the uplifting grander of the historic mass

[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:31.860]
For a little while at least Milwaukee's could almost forget about the sex scandals rocking the Catholic Church

[01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:32.680]
Oh sorry Dennis

[01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:40.140]
That is until WTMG AM 620 interrupt to the slide broadcast with an ad for a male sex enhancing drug

[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:48.180]
That's right Milwaukee's top news station ran a commercial for a product named insight which claims to boost the male function that rhymes with election

[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:53.920]
In short size does matter according to insight and now there's hope for men with under inflated egos

[01:52:55.400 --> 01:53:00.040]
Mortified WTMG officials promptly yanked the ad they yanked it from the broadcast

[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:05.700]
We're not be not be forwarded run out once in its entirety said John Schweitzer WTMG general manager

[01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:12.340]
It seems the station neglected the screen the azure that afternoon broadcast news stations have long been ridiculed for undercutting serious news covered

[01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:16.960]
Within appropriate commercials and this chemical miscept certainly qualifies for the hall of shame it says

[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:24.020]
It was obviously a terrible oversight there was no sweep of the commercials to see if there were any content issues can see Schweitzer

[01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:29.860]
And a lot of us become a rather publication for the Catholic Church it just wasn't an appropriate commercial run during the programming

[01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:36.480]
Never less than the industry were on the Almighty advertiser as sacred the station has no plans to discontinue the question of a lot in other news programming

[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:40.320]
Sash Schweitzer we don't see any reason to punish the advertiser for mistake we'd be making

[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:41.520]
How do you like that?

[01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:43.260]
Exactly

[01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:49.420]
Now what's wrong with having a priest with a large penis?

[01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:53.680]
Well, is there anything wrong with that?

[01:53:53.840 --> 01:54:01.880]
I'll ask the ultra boy how many how many copies of this so that's the old one here's good news Taiwan rules oral sex isn't adultery

[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:09.920]
Oh right I bet your bubble would like to hear this a group of Taiwanese judges and lawyers say oral sex is not intercourse and so it isn't adultery

[01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:19.180]
Judges are not found by the decision but it can be used as a reference in future cases 49 of 60 judges and lawyers support the view that intercourse means

[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:26.760]
Genital to genital contact the opposing camp at the law making forms as sexual intercourse should refer to any form of genital contact

[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:34.320]
But a spokesman for Taiwan's high court says there is no law stating whether oral sex is a form of intercourse and so judges are left to make their own decisions

[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:40.580]
The spokesman added whatever decisions these participants came up with during the meeting will only be a reference for judges when they handle some more cases in the future

[01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:46.480]
And on named Taipei judge who opposed the decision told the Taipei times the conclusion could influence decisions in future trials

[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:55.520]
He suggests the county's criminal code the country's criminal code be amended to state clearly that oral sex constitutes sexual intercourse and they're saying no way

[01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:57.480]
We like the bubble version

[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:03.420]
560560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Marvel's line

[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:06.020]
Lady and Miami hello

[01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:07.580]
Hey Neil how you doing?

[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:08.460]
I'm doing great

[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:15.140]
I'm by no means feminist you know but I'm not afraid ashamed to get on my knees and please my man

[01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:20.700]
But I don't understand why these good old boys, Donna Augusta, won't extend a membership to women

[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:27.640]
Including 560's demandage and he makes the biggest deal about not letting women in

[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:29.740]
Because he's a sexist pig that's wine

[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:36.420]
Exactly but my thing is their argument is that it's their right not to have not to do that

[01:55:36.420 --> 01:55:40.540]
But isn't it also in the Constitution to treat everyone equally?

[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:45.460]
Well you know see they keep using this thing about it being a private club and technically that is correct

[01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:55.580]
Private clubs can exclude or include anybody they prefer to have but I'll say it again if they didn't allow black people to be members and Augusta still which up until not to many years ago

[01:55:55.580 --> 01:55:59.260]
They do allow black people to go to the government but I'm saying if they have two members

[01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:05.940]
If they didn't have any black members now do you think that CBS will be continuing to televised by the actors go through them?

[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:06.860]
Of course not

[01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:13.080]
Women's discrimination is one of the most underrated forms of discrimination going on

[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:17.900]
And you have to understand especially when you see the way that most jocks treat women and I'm not talking about manage

[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:23.720]
But I'm just saying you're speaking generally that the sexism that exists among the jockocracy in this country is rampant

[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:25.960]
I mean it's a legend here so that shouldn't come as a surprise

[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:27.520]
It's about homosexuality

[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:31.280]
And that's almost all the same lines and it's just not fair

[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:35.420]
Well let me ask you do we have any out of the closet gay people or members of the Augusta Golf Club?

[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:36.340]
Oh no way

[01:56:36.340 --> 01:56:37.600]
I sure don't think so

[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:38.700]
No way so

[01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:39.660]
God forbid

[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:47.200]
Just passed out and I'm also a registered dietitian and I actually recommend the actions diet for over a year

[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:47.720]
Oh right

[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:51.620]
And people who have a tendency to become diabetic

[01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:55.080]
And I've seen a lot of people lose a lot of weight

[01:56:55.660 --> 01:56:56.060]
Excellent

[01:56:56.060 --> 01:56:57.420]
They should definitely give it a try

[01:56:57.420 --> 01:56:58.480]
Okay thanks we're not

[01:56:58.480 --> 01:56:59.060]
All righty

[01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:00.000]
Back in the kitchen now

[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:00.700]
Love you George

[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:01.160]
See ya

[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:04.600]
Yeah keep a barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen

[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:10.000]
The sexist attitudes in America today are grotesque discussing and I'll say it again this argument

[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.460]
I keep hearing all over our radio stations especially in a morning mo about well

[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:16.000]
And they got more fish bigger fish to fry more important issues

[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.080]
That's not the point

[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:18.560]
That's not the point

Wherever you find discrimination you have to fight it

[01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:26.380]
You have to break down the barriers

[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:31.920]
And you have to protest the people who support

[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:38.200]

But we got the pressure of the trends coming out

[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:20.360]

Which August is September already you know that's like dead stuff

It's already part of the summer book but that's the way it goes

[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:29.700]
It's like a rolling three month average

[02:04:29.700 --> 02:04:37.440]
So this will include one new month which is October which will eventually be part of the fall book about October remember December you got that I didn't think so but that's way works

[02:04:38.140 --> 02:04:40.020]

Once you refused to have her first marriage in old he finally agreed to baptize her her father then asked me we get along well if I be the Godfather

McGotton are wrestling match with a freshman teammate immediately after coming off the field from practice

[02:07:57.600 --> 02:08:00.480]
Such horseplay is not unusual several team members said Thursday

[02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:06.660]
But this time the wrestling got out of hand it got out of their hand there was a lot of stuff going on running around getting people

[02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:11.280]
Wedgies writing on the victim is but with a sharpie pen so one of the players I guess they crossed the line

[02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:17.380]
A report filed with the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office by campus police said the attackers held the victim down

[02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:20.780]
Stripped in those underwear and attacked him numerous times on the rear end

[02:08:20.780 --> 02:08:21.240]
Backed him

[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:26.180]
There were also attempts to write on the victim's naked rear end before one participant identified as Wilkerson

[02:08:26.180 --> 02:08:29.640]
Sexually assaulted the victim with the pen the report said oh

[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:34.620]
You think it was a ballpoint? Let's hope not or sharpie. Oh

[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:39.360]
The victim was taken to the emergency room with Kate Fear Valley medical center

[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:44.880]
He was treated and released he filed a report with campus police that evening the players were immediately suspended from the team

[02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:47.500]
Last Wednesday campus police officer filed criminal charges

[02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:53.880]
Good methodist spokeswoman Cynthia Curtis had the coulvers investigating were disturbed by it she said but we feel like we've taken appropriate action

[02:08:53.880 --> 02:09:00.520]
Curtis said while the schools administration is concerned about what happened to the locker room attack and isolated incident methodist person

[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:08.640]

It was all just horseplay baby it was all just a little locker room fun it was just guys running around naked snap and towels on each

[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:32.440]
Other's ass and having some good locker room fun gay boys being gay boys right

[02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:56.380]
Sponsors be subsidizing them and finally because of the pressure they they had no sponsors this year this coming year

[02:09:56.380 --> 02:10:02.040]
Hmm yeah they're gonna they're gonna like foot the build themselves the network which don't want to tell that much anyway

Which TV network slants the news the most we asked and we've got a staggering response 575 votes

[02:10:12.660 --> 02:10:21.880]

[02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:14.800]

Hard as a paradise

[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:13.600]
It is paradise I didn't realize that Greg was a waiter at Pompe no park I'll have to look for him next time I'm up there

[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:14.800]
Notice that

[02:13:16.100 --> 02:13:22.340]
1147 at 560 W to come in a good news is the reason I play that is because the little free plug I get in here for my buddies at Pompe no park

[02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:29.340]
Dick Pineburg tells me that's starting and I can't remember the date when Pompe no park opens like four nights a week starting on Monday nights

[02:13:30.220 --> 02:13:36.360]
Which I'm sure is by the first of the year on Mondays we're bringing back the free spaghetti dinner on the fourth floor how do you like that

[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:44.260]
Not great with all these shake on parmesan you can eat I can't wait to see that see a blue hair out there on a fourth floor in fact out front waiting to get in

[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:51.520]
For the free spaghetti dinner it'll be great in fact I think this year will break all the records I'm gonna pack that place

[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:57.320]
We're gonna get people driving down from Jacksonville from Jojo for free spaghetti at Pompe no park this year

[02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:02.580]
Ice cream packages shrink a less than a half a gallon that's the the pressing

[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:10.880]
Well now you have to buy two yeah I have to buy two of those now I'm trying to think if I ever actually ate a half a gallon of ice cream at one time I know

[02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:17.240]
That would be even if I admitted that wouldn't that be like over the line that'd be a little porky yeah I never did that

[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:23.620]
Quart no problem a leader which is a little more than a quart piece of cake no sweat actually be good on a piece of cake chocolate

[02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:29.720]
Ooh that chocolate marshmallow kind of cake you know I'm talking about yeah mmm or on pie

[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:38.100]
The half gallon ice cream condemn that crazy butt pie I do like Denny's pies though I like that like the Korean cream some ice cream on top of it nice apple alamone

[02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:44.720]
Yeah that's for goyem all right the half gallon ice cream can when you shut up already so I can do this story Jesus cry

[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:49.980]
You just want to do the rest of the show today because I don't I'm saying like it a little nasal here you know like that

[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:55.920]
Just keeps mumbling and mumbling you're up to your old ways again you're mumbling I can't understand a damn thing you're saying

[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:07.300]
I don't want those headphones on you out of your mind the half gallon ice cream container they sweet standard of groceries store freezers for decades is starting to shrink

[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:14.400]
While manufacturers over the years reduce the packet size of everything from candy bars to dis detergent the traditional ice cream brick

[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:22.540]
Remained what it was the half gallon not anymore not no mo now pinched by rising ingredient cost and afraid to raise prices already above five bucks

[02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:30.260]
At least two ice cream makers have started silently to phase it out the half gallon with 1.75 quart cartons I have find smaller

[02:15:30.260 --> 02:15:32.500]
I bet you could polish that off

[02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:35.940]
Huh?

[02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:40.120]
It's one place one and three quarters quartz now I couldn't do it.

[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:45.980]
Dryers which is based in Oakland California and sells the dryers and eaties brand so we're not fond of eaties

[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:55.080]
We like to people who sell it but we don't like that began introducing the smaller package in March the new and old cartons can be found side by side during the transition identical in shape and design and price

[02:15:55.080 --> 02:16:02.560]
But one has two quarts the other one three quarters quartz we have over a hundred flavors in many of them because people are preferring indulgent chunky flavors

[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:09.000]
Cost more to produce than regular flavors like vanilla said dryers folks woman duri Bailey we like to keep the cost of the price that's more affordable to folks

[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:18.780]
Schwands which sells primarily via a 7,000 vehicle feed of home delivery trucks made the switch in 2000 year area of Schwands yes I heard a Schwands Northwest

[02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:25.040]
Never heard of it other major ice cream makers including good humor briars and turkey hill are sticking with a half gallon for now

[02:16:26.380 --> 02:16:27.360]
I don't get it.

[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:29.040]
First of all why does there have to be a half gallon?

[02:16:30.440 --> 02:16:31.180]
There does.

[02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:39.140]
Can you just buy like a bunch of quarts and when they make you buy more that way if they were like clever more clever packaging why don't you buy a half a gallon of ice cream?

[02:16:40.620 --> 02:16:50.120]
I give up and I envision I envision people who buy like seal test what do they call me a polyton you know the three the chocolate vanilla strawberry yeah that's for goyem okay those

[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:54.340]
Seriously definitely for people with absolutely no taste at all.

[02:16:56.060 --> 02:16:59.420]
Neopold chocolate strawberry and vanilla that is not strawberry.

[02:16:59.420 --> 02:17:03.160]
Oh that's almost as bad as plain vanilla ice cream.

[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:20.740]
Italy rejects pornography tax Italian lawmaker's have voted not to impose a heavy tax on pornography the government had proposed a levy on the manufacture distribution and sale of pornographic magazines comes in video tapes but the chamber of deputies voted 250 to 57 not to impose a 25% tax on the material.

[02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:35.260]
When premier Sylvia or brother Skoney's conservative government he he's got to be the biggest cook in the world today in government I mean even Osama Yamama and well he's not in government Saddam Hussein small potatoes compared to Sylvia or brother Skoney who's over here shaking it with bush couple

[02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:44.120]
We months ago remember that nope when premier Sylvia or brother Skoney's conservative government announced a proposal last month it sparked a debate among those opposed to such a high levy other said the government should

[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:50.020]
Bandport outright not make money from it at citizens so on but they said no way Jose that's a good stuff.

[02:17:51.920 --> 02:18:08.240]
5 670 5 I sure like to get a couple of calls in in between all this great stuff as my pile continues to be you know you got a huge pile but they just aren't there you know can you imagine if I was still just taking calls and I'm doing all this other stuff I can't here's Miami hello.

[02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:19.760]
Yes sir I just wanted to say that I think that it's the Augusta that woman actually be surprised at what a woman could do with a golf club yeah yeah and I wanted to tell you all there's no fact in Augusta.

[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:36.800]
Okay sin now you know why there was no calls yeah seriously how is it possible for an area the size of South Florida to have no material about anything look at the stuff that we've talked about here today just in these first three hours

[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:50.100]
staggering we could write a book about it and these people like that it's very it's terrifying and yet those months that we shut the phone down oh gee we want to hear those callers back like that call right there he was pretty entertaining

[02:18:50.100 --> 02:19:05.720]
what they know I was sensation he was so simplifying 5 670 560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line speak now or hold it forever that's my suggestion to you get with it now or lose it.

[02:19:07.660 --> 02:19:36.780]
You know what they're coming like one at a time now they don't want to over do the same person you never know here's Miami again hello. Hey me how you doing okay I got a fire report every other day whatever you talk about the Schmidt head is talking about the same thing yesterday he was talking remember you mentioned about the chemicals going through the breeding right so just uniform exact same material 3 30 yesterday yeah I'm going I think you know what you're talking about.

[02:19:36.780 --> 02:19:47.520]
So I think he's a cause of a listener and I don't think so because first of all I'm pretty sure he doesn't because he does the show in the morning and then again the afternoon in Tampa so I was on the afternoon.

[02:19:48.440 --> 02:20:03.100]
Is it opposite you in the morning I'm sorry let me let me sit again he does a show in the morning I think I don't know who carries it not not in this market and a show in the afternoon is on I would do it's also on he operates out of the does it show from WFLA in Tampa.

[02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:17.860]
Right so the opposite of you and the more he's he's on on the same time he's not opposite me because I'm not on that market but he wouldn't be listening to my show because he's on the earth at that point see it it's all it's one of those stories that was on a wire services that wasn't like an exclusive to this program so I'm out.

[02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:30.280]
It's not only yesterday I mean last week he was also talking something that he's already heard on your show yeah he's talking about the same thing in the afternoon I just thought maybe with a closet listener but maybe maybe he is in the closet.

[02:20:30.280 --> 02:21:00.260]
Maybe he's listening while he's going to show he is simply Tampa radio like I told you before he's strictly Tampa radio and I said that before I knew where he was doing the show from remember when he first came on here we thought he was doing the show at IOD he's been doing the show at FLA in Tampa all along and that show is vintage Tampa radio I mean it's exactly what you expect from WFLA week he's a rush wannabe he's like a minor league rush and the only reason he's got any numbers is because he takes the the right wing number from rush and runs with you know I'm sorry.

[02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:29.620]
I'm not saying that's his leading and by the way speaking of lead ends since that trend is coming out this afternoon and I on record you heard me say this many many times in spite of most protestations throw a number in there for a small in the morning okay haven't I been saying that yes just this one time we're not rooting against you were rooting for you because even if it's only for selfish reasons we want those extra bonuses okay baby we want the entire station to have big goddamn juicy numbers that's what it's all a boot so throw one in there this time.

[02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:15.360]
and finally out of here. I'm finally out of here. I'm finally out of here. I'm finally out of here. This boats give

[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:24.180]
I'm finally out of here. This boats give raises all my desires. Everybody's going straight

[02:25:24.180 --> 02:25:29.180]
Got in the dump of room, with farting wood isn't meant best

[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:37.460]
It's really impossible to conceal, farting wood isn't meant best

[02:25:37.460 --> 02:25:44.180]
I feel like a bachelor, without a wheel, farting wood isn't meant best

[02:25:45.940 --> 02:25:52.340]
It's almost impossible to conceal, farting wood isn't meant best

[02:25:52.340 --> 02:25:57.880]
I feel like a bachelor, without a wheel, farting wood isn't meant best

[02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:01.140]
12.2.5.60 W.C.M. speaking of diet, the pork wins out

[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:10.220]
They sent it voted today, 52-47 against the Democratic Airport, district what they called, seven special interest provisions out of legislation creating a Department of Homeland Security

[02:26:10.220 --> 02:26:11.500]
So the pork is still in there

[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:18.260]
The provisions which include liability protections for pharmaceutical manufacturers and companies that develop anti-terrorism technologies

[02:26:18.260 --> 02:26:24.200]
In other words, pork for big business have been inserted into legislation by House Republicans and approved by the House last week

[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:31.800]
This is an atrocious demonstration of demeaning the legislative process, Senate Majority Leader Tom Bashall said before the vote, they ought to be ashamed of themselves

[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:38.380]
But Jueling Senator Phil Graham, Republican of Texas said it was not worth risking the overall bill by stripping out the provisions

[02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:45.280]
I think that's a risk not worth taking and I further believe the bill is a better bill with the seven provisions in a Graham said as he wiped the jewel off his chin

[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:50.840]
The bill if enacted would create a 170,000 employee department dedicated to fighting domestic terrorism

[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:54.140]
President Bush said getting the bill signed into law this year is the top priority

[02:26:54.140 --> 02:27:02.180]
More votes on legislation are scheduled today but it was not clear when the vote on final passage would take place because of an expected debate the final vote may not take place today

[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:08.440]
Yesterday, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, announced that he would sell with Democrats on the vote to strip the seven provisions from the bill

[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:13.820]
But most moderates opposed the Democratic effort and Senator Dean Barkley, the independent from Minnesota voted with Republicans

[02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:16.920]
Thanks a lot Jesse, Jesse Ventura and a fit of peak

[02:27:17.380 --> 02:27:23.580]
Although wouldn't have made any difference because the Republican won anyway, Norm Coleman, the anxious Republican from Minnesota won anyway, right?

[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:25.720]
Right, so he'd have been in there anyway

[02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:28.160]
Wouldn't he?

[02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:29.600]
Wouldn't he?

[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:33.000]
No, not today, what's today, I don't know what the date is

[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:33.960]
Well, eventually

[02:27:35.580 --> 02:27:39.740]
56670560, look at the way these call are coming in one at a time, you notice here's Kendall, hello

[02:27:39.740 --> 02:27:41.160]
Hey Neil, what's up father?

[02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:42.160]
Yes sir, how you doing?

[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:46.380]
Hi, man, I caught the tail end of that 40 tax

[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:53.740]
How were they intending on taxing for therapy? Was it by like the amount of tax, the amount of key involved?

[02:27:55.260 --> 02:27:58.340]
Yeah, by the, uh, sports court, by the orgasm

[02:27:58.340 --> 02:27:59.980]
Yeah, that's what it was, but we did pretty good

[02:28:00.540 --> 02:28:02.720]
You will be fine to get a job right now

[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:06.880]
Hey, okay, have a great day, pal, whatever you said, kind of beggin new phone

[02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:11.160]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&TL

[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:14.440]
Look at this, good morning Neil, you mentioned the Kendall worth hotel, might have been incident that happened

[02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:19.460]
In 56 or 57 when I came down to visit my grandparents who spent every winter here at the Saxony hotel

[02:28:19.460 --> 02:28:22.380]
I remember that well, Saxony, the Atlantic Towers

[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:25.800]
All those rundown old hotels up there in the north

[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:27.620]
You know what I'm talking about? No

[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:33.320]
Yeah, you do, like in the central part of the beach, you know, between where the fountain balloon, the Eden Rock are right now

[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:38.280]
I would like to say, I was 14 or 50 and wanted to go out and fight others, my own age, with whom to spend evenings

[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:40.220]
I didn't want to hang around my grandparents and their friends

[02:28:40.220 --> 02:28:42.780]
A few of us, this kid's decided to go to hotel hopping

[02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:44.860]
We wound up at the Kendall worth and walked into the lobby

[02:28:44.860 --> 02:28:47.080]
I was wearing a mizuzat around my neck

[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:47.440]
Oy!

[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.480]
And I received a couple of years before as a bar mitzvah present

[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:52.420]
So it was obvious to anyone who saw that I was Jewish

[02:28:53.100 --> 02:28:57.380]
We had been wandering around the lobby for about five minutes when a man came up to us and said I had to leave the hotel

[02:28:57.820 --> 02:29:00.480]
When I protested, I did nothing to deserve being thrown out of the hotel

[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:02.280]
He said to me, you are a Jew, aren't you?

[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:07.620]
I said something like, sure, so what? To which you replied, we don't allow dogs or Jews in here so get out

[02:29:09.420 --> 02:29:13.140]
I was shocked in my 14 or 15 years of life I never been exposed to anything like this

[02:29:13.140 --> 02:29:16.060]
I had no idea that things like this happened and was a wake up call to me

[02:29:16.060 --> 02:29:21.060]
When I told my grandparents about it the next day they told me that that type of thing happened where they came from quite often

[02:29:21.060 --> 02:29:22.900]
They tried to explain it to me but never could

[02:29:22.900 --> 02:29:28.100]
That incident more than anything else I can remember shaped my belief that discrimination in any form is a great wrong

[02:29:28.660 --> 02:29:29.680]
Absolutely correct Bob

[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:32.780]
Bob's got to send the facts

[02:29:34.020 --> 02:29:34.700]
Remember Bob?

[02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:35.860]
I do know

[02:29:35.860 --> 02:29:39.580]
So there you go and that's what, and of course you notice we're not going to any response on that

[02:29:39.580 --> 02:29:43.340]
Because they all be calling in the mad dog about the tiger and about the New York Times and the tutorial

[02:29:43.340 --> 02:29:47.060]
And the be calling out all the other shows, the sports they're showing where they can get the sympathy

[02:29:47.060 --> 02:29:49.720]
All these women go bother somebody else

[02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:56.560]
And I guarantee if it was Jews, if it was blacks, if it was Hispanics

[02:29:56.560 --> 02:30:00.280]
There was the Chinaman's chance in hell in this day and age or if it was Chinaman

[02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:03.900]
There was no chance in hell if they'd say, oh well we're not going to let that meet in either

[02:30:03.900 --> 02:30:08.380]
And expect CBS to continue covering it and sponsors to continue in the future subsidizing it

[02:30:08.380 --> 02:30:09.020]
No chance

[02:30:11.180 --> 02:30:16.060]
But women, like I said, knock them up, let them stay in the kitchen in the bedroom and get them out of our face

[02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:17.960]
That's what George says

[02:30:19.860 --> 02:30:22.180]
And you did, and that works like a term

[02:30:22.660 --> 02:30:24.420]
Here's my new beach, hello

[02:30:24.420 --> 02:30:28.080]
Yeah, the soup is the name of the pea soup in Holland

[02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:28.720]
Yeah

[02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:30.880]
Yeah

[02:30:30.880 --> 02:30:30.940]
Yeah

[02:30:31.820 --> 02:30:32.140]
Hello

[02:30:32.700 --> 02:30:33.020]
Yes

[02:30:33.020 --> 02:30:33.700]
Are you there?

[02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:35.200]
I heard you, yes

[02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:36.480]
Okay, no, I didn't hear any response

[02:30:37.100 --> 02:30:38.420]
Well, what am I supposed to be surprised?

[02:30:38.460 --> 02:30:41.920]
No, no, no, because you were talking about earlier, I just wanted to get the right word out but

[02:30:41.920 --> 02:30:42.300]
Yeah

[02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:44.220]
Hey, what are you doing in Toronto anyway?

[02:30:44.220 --> 02:30:45.020]
It was just kind of wetter

[02:30:46.200 --> 02:30:48.080]
What am I doing? I'm enjoying it very much

[02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:49.760]
What do you mean this kind of weather? What does that mean?

[02:30:49.880 --> 02:30:51.440]
No, it's great down here

[02:30:52.100 --> 02:30:52.740]
At the moment

[02:30:52.740 --> 02:30:54.460]
Yeah, it's great right here

[02:30:54.460 --> 02:30:57.160]
It's like 443, I have no problem with it

[02:30:57.160 --> 02:31:01.500]
I'll be an Amsterdam not too distant future, it'll be like in the 30s and 40s there, what's wrong with that?

[02:31:01.640 --> 02:31:03.220]
Oh no, I just think, you know, whatever

[02:31:03.220 --> 02:31:05.940]
I want myself up with some of that great pea soup

[02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:08.560]
Okay, yeah, and do you put the sausage in there?

[02:31:08.900 --> 02:31:10.660]
Yeah, put the little sausage in there too, right?

[02:31:10.660 --> 02:31:14.860]
Because I always had to prom here when the order is here, I always have to ask a hotdog with no bread

[02:31:14.860 --> 02:31:16.420]
Never leave out the sausage

[02:31:16.420 --> 02:31:17.880]
That's it, the sausage got to go there

[02:31:17.880 --> 02:31:20.280]
Okay, Doc-A-Vell puts some of it in here, you're done

[02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:20.980]
You're done

[02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:27.160]
5,670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line

[02:31:27.160 --> 02:31:27.460]
Oh

[02:31:27.460 --> 02:31:30.460]
We want the calls, Neil, the calls, that's the...

[02:31:30.460 --> 02:31:32.840]
That guy had a call Friday, he was one of the old time best

[02:31:32.840 --> 02:31:35.740]
They're paying you all that money to take phone calls, no they're not

[02:31:35.740 --> 02:31:36.880]
Yeah, they are

[02:31:37.880 --> 02:31:39.960]
Maybe he can allope with Dennis, maybe we can give him a date

[02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:44.260]
Speaking of Dennis, what a great segue, didn't even realize it

[02:31:44.260 --> 02:31:49.080]
A priest who was accused but never convicted of child molestation has been defrocked by Pope John Paul the tooth

[02:31:49.080 --> 02:31:51.800]
For disobeying orders not to serve as a priest in public

[02:31:53.040 --> 02:31:53.760]
Anthony Chipola

[02:31:55.400 --> 02:31:56.060]
Love the sauce

[02:31:57.460 --> 02:31:58.180]
Anthony Onion

[02:31:59.220 --> 02:32:01.880]
Anthony Chipola, if it didn't have anything to eat with the canon lawyer to discuss

[02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:05.600]
Appealing the Pope's order to lay aside him and could not be immediately reached

[02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:12.080]
The Vatican decreased states that the penalty is unappealable, said Ronald Lenguin, spokesman for the Pittsburgh diocese

[02:32:12.080 --> 02:32:15.900]
I've never encountered anything like this, Bishop Donald Whirl of Pittsburgh said

[02:32:15.900 --> 02:32:20.020]
There's sufficient evidence to indicate Chipola didn't seem to understand these seriousness of all of this

[02:32:20.020 --> 02:32:27.220]
It wasn't clear when Chipola was defrocked but church officials told the Pittsburgh Post Gazette for the additions on what they is this

[02:32:27.220 --> 02:32:29.220]
On Sunday that it happened recently

[02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:33.220]
Chipola has denied various molestation charges against them that first surfaced in 1978

[02:32:33.820 --> 02:32:37.380]
One of the accusers sued an 88 in the Pittsburgh diocese, said in the case of 93

[02:32:37.380 --> 02:32:41.460]
Whirl has been battling two disciplines, Chipola since becoming Bishop in 88

[02:32:42.200 --> 02:32:47.840]
Chipola was ordained in 1972, he was charged in 1978 with costing a nine-year-old boy who went to his rectory

[02:32:47.840 --> 02:32:53.120]
For the first communion instruction, the boy's mother later dropped the charges saying she was pressured by church officials

[02:32:53.120 --> 02:33:00.880]
Another man, Tim Bendig 33 sued an 88, alleging that Chipola began molesting him when he was 12, he said the abuse continued till he was 17

[02:33:01.760 --> 02:33:06.300]
Probably got too old at that point, like Michael Jackson's chimp bubbles

[02:33:06.840 --> 02:33:13.640]
The dicey settled that case over Chipola's objections in 93, five years after Whirl had removed him from public ministry but allowed him to remain a priest

[02:33:13.640 --> 02:33:21.120]
Chipola has not had an official priestly assignment since church officials said 91 he appealed his removal from public ministry to the Vatican which ordered him reinstated 93

[02:33:22.260 --> 02:33:27.860]
Whirl refused to comply with the Vatican's order to return to Rome which Chipola's file including the 78 police arrest report in 95

[02:33:27.860 --> 02:33:31.660]
The Vatican reversed itself and Chipola was again officially barred from public ministry

[02:33:32.420 --> 02:33:34.380]
Anthony onions sounds like a mobster

[02:33:34.380 --> 02:33:41.180]
Whirl petitioned the Vatican and may asking the Pope to lay aside Chipola meaning he no longer could celebrate mass or we see final support from the diocese

[02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:47.000]
Whirl said the final straw was a report that Chipola was recognized while trying to celebrate a mass at a church in Rome of all places

[02:33:47.460 --> 02:33:52.120]
The diocese and official said Chipola repeatedly served public as a priest in violation of the 95 ban

[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:56.980]
How do you like that? They said your ban, he said no I'm not, you're not going to do it anymore, yes I am

[02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:05.660]
Real mess in there, you know, in fact Dennis talk about doing productive things instead of wasting your time calling about your stupid radio talk shows

[02:34:05.660 --> 02:34:10.580]
You ought to be in there cleaning up the mess in your own church Dennis, there's no mess, you ought to be cleaning up your deal

[02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:20.340]
You're not going to do it anymore, you're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:20.340]

[02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:20.460]
You're not going to do it anymore, you're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:20.460 --> 02:34:21.800]
You're not going to do it anymore, you're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:22.560]
You're not going to do it anymore, you're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:23.380]
You're not going to do it anymore, you're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:34.020]
You're not going to do it anymore, you're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:34.020 --> 02:34:38.760]
You're not going to do it anymore, you're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:39.300]
You're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:39.300 --> 02:34:39.360]
You're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:39.360]

[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:39.360]

[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:39.720]
You're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:40.560]
You're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:54.020]
You're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:54.020 --> 02:34:55.740]
You're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:55.740 --> 02:34:56.400]
You're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:56.400]

[02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:56.420]
You're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:56.420 --> 02:34:56.440]
You're not going to do it anymore

[02:34:56.440 --> 02:34:56.500]

That's not the least of the...

[02:36:11.180 --> 02:36:12.360]
Nice teeth though, I did like that

[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:13.500]
I did like that teeth though, I did like that teeth though, I didn't get away

My, and locals, this is 4205 City

[02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:25.620]
You ain't who I am

[02:37:28.060 --> 02:37:31.740]
If you like Klondike bars, you'll love Bulldyk bars

[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:34.520]
Hey you, what would you do for a Bulldyk bar?

[02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:37.700]
It's a big iron bar that Bulldyk's hit men with

[02:37:37.700 --> 02:37:38.780]
Say you're a man!

[02:37:39.060 --> 02:37:40.260]
I didn't do anything!

[02:37:40.380 --> 02:37:42.520]
I guess you don't have to do anything for a Bulldyk bar

[02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:44.420]
Here, have another one! You pig!

[02:37:44.700 --> 02:37:47.400]
Bulldyk bars, if you're a man, you don't have to do anything

[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:49.380]
Just hang around and odds are you'll get one

[02:37:49.380 --> 02:37:50.980]
Out, stop that! You pig!

[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:53.600]
You man! You pig man!

[02:37:54.060 --> 02:37:57.980]
From 17 to 560, I think that's what they're really hoodie in the crowd there, hoodie in the blowfish

[02:37:57.980 --> 02:38:00.340]
What they're psychotic about there in Augusta

[02:38:00.340 --> 02:38:02.800]
They don't want a big bunch of Bulldyk's start to join in there, you know?

[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:05.260]
Right, I'll just bring you up to place

[02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:06.680]
So let me ask you, what's been right?

[02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:09.620]
Here's Miami Beach, hello

[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:11.440]
Hello?

[02:38:11.820 --> 02:38:12.220]
Yes sir

[02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:16.200]
What's this right here that a gust of 1-1-1-1-1

[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:18.720]
Number two, what's this about Lincoln not feeling too good?

[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:20.680]
Yeah, okay

[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:24.360]
It's only the top story on a goddamn, uh,

[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:26.060]
It's all the sports pages today pal

[02:38:26.060 --> 02:38:28.040]
New York Times Editorial yesterday

[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:31.420]
5,6705, city, whatever the hell I was supposed to mean, okay?

[02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:33.820]
By the way, time to put your teeth back in for the next call

[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:37.880]
5,6705, 60, pound, 560 on the AT&T

[02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:39.300]
And Verizon Wireless Line

[02:38:39.980 --> 02:38:41.960]
It's terminal, here's Pompano, hello

[02:38:45.100 --> 02:38:46.820]
Okay, like I said, let's get to my stuff now

[02:38:46.820 --> 02:38:49.120]
How is it? Always during the noon to 1 hour?

[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:52.160]
I mean, you have to squeeze out whatever you can between like 9 to noon

[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:53.660]
But then between noon and 1 day

[02:38:53.660 --> 02:38:56.080]
It's like somebody just pulled the plug, it's always there out to lunch

[02:38:56.080 --> 02:38:56.960]
They got time

[02:38:58.220 --> 02:38:59.020]
What does that mean?

[02:38:59.460 --> 02:39:01.660]
That they got time to make a call from their little capital

[02:39:01.660 --> 02:39:03.500]
Oh, these people, this crowd I see

[02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:06.220]
How much more can Whitney take when I talk about Ray Whitney?

[02:39:07.700 --> 02:39:09.040]
Come on, now what are you giving me then?

[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:10.520]
I don't want it to kill a rip of story

[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:13.500]
Okay, it's way down

[02:39:13.500 --> 02:39:18.840]
It's way down here, okay in my pile, it's about like number 5 in my tabloid Tuesday

[02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:20.340]
Nobody cares about Whitney anymore

[02:39:20.340 --> 02:39:22.940]
The hell they don't, she's washed up

[02:39:22.940 --> 02:39:24.160]
She's still shrieking it out

[02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:25.120]
Yeah, nobody cares

[02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:28.460]
And good old downtown Bobby Brown, he doesn't care anymore

[02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:30.560]
Tell you RIPPA's secret

[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:32.200]
Wait a minute, yeah?

[02:39:32.620 --> 02:39:33.600]
Secret collapse

[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:37.560]
Oh, health nightmare, ripping pregnant star apart

[02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:39.560]
And I got news for her

[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:41.200]
Oh, and also what about many knees pain?

[02:39:41.300 --> 02:39:43.420]
Tiny standards rehab to kick your booze habit

[02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:45.200]
What are you giving me that?

[02:39:45.420 --> 02:39:46.160]
I feel sorry for him

[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:47.380]
Well, we'll get into that

[02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:52.160]
But anyway, Keller, RIPPA, whatever an LR name is

[02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:55.960]
Kali RIPPA is being ripped apart by devastating panic and anxiety attacks

[02:39:55.960 --> 02:39:59.800]
That are destroying her sleep attacking her health and living her mentally and physically exhausted

[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:04.480]
The tremendous stress of working two jobs while being pregnant during her two small children

[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:09.980]
And dealing with intense family problems as thrusty, 32-year-old beauty into a desperate battle to hold her life together

[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:15.120]
Kali's being ground down by a night tear is that repeatedly jar her awake cold sweats

[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:19.440]
Shortness of breath, this orientation aches in pain and a annoying feeling of being overwhelmed

[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:24.060]
While she appears bright and perky on live with Regis and Kali all over her ugly

[02:40:24.060 --> 02:40:27.240]
The talented performer citing a secret collapse from the show's viewers

[02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:33.300]
The constant pressure came to a head when Kali flew from her nearer home for an October 20th security event on a west coast

[02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:39.280]
She returned home completely wrung out and fell apart in front of her devoted husband Mark Consuelo's source to say

[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:47.460]
Kali sobbed and gasped her breath as she told Mark how the anxiety in life is consuming her and inside it of obviously the inquiries she collapsed

[02:40:47.460 --> 02:40:51.300]
Mark tried desperately to help his wife but she cried herself in a complete exhaustion

[02:40:51.300 --> 02:40:53.980]
Are you like working up a real sympathy for her?

[02:40:54.460 --> 02:40:56.440]
No, I'm not either, she makes me sick

[02:40:56.440 --> 02:40:59.000]
Why did she see that? Why was I wait down on my pile?

[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.120]
I thought it was something spicy, you never know what it was

[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:05.780]
It is not that spicy, it's just another one that was sympathy and another one that was puffed

[02:41:05.780 --> 02:41:06.480]
Yeah, that's all

[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:08.060]
When you kept teasing it, you didn't say it all the time

[02:41:08.060 --> 02:41:11.660]
I kept teasing it because the pictures in there show you how ugly she really is, that's why

[02:41:11.660 --> 02:41:13.900]
Not that there was any big, big spicy thing

[02:41:13.900 --> 02:41:17.440]
It was a spicy thing you would have heard it yesterday, okay?

[02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:19.100]
She is definitely one of the spicy girls

[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:21.700]
Now many me, that's another story

[02:41:21.700 --> 02:41:22.040]
Vern

[02:41:24.180 --> 02:41:27.820]
And here's a picture of a hard drink in Vern taking a swig

[02:41:27.820 --> 02:41:29.580]
Hmm, of a mini beer

[02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:35.320]
Half-pine actor Vern Troyer has entered rehab to kick the deadly booze habit that almost killed him

[02:41:35.320 --> 02:41:39.380]
And recovering addict Robert Downey Jr. is giving him a boost out of the wagon

[02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:44.400]
The 32-inch tall star who plays Mini Me in the Austin Powers movies checked into wavelengths

[02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:47.640]
Rehab Center in Malibu after the inquire reported that exclusively in September

[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:50.480]
He'd been hospitalized for a near fatal bout of alcohol poisoning

[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:52.740]
When you're that small, I guess you don't have to drink an awful lot

[02:41:52.740 --> 02:41:53.320]
No

[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:54.420]
To check out

[02:41:54.420 --> 02:41:54.840]
Right

[02:41:55.480 --> 02:41:57.380]
Something good came out of the bad publicity

[02:41:57.380 --> 02:42:01.520]
Vern's problem was finally out in the open of friend declared Vern realized he had a stop-drinking

[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:05.140]
He knows he could have died from his wild vendor just before Labor Day

[02:42:05.140 --> 02:42:07.360]
The inquire story was a real wake-up call

[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:10.300]
This is kind of like the inquire patting itself on a back like we saved his life

[02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:15.980]
He chose to go to wavelengths to place credit with helping Downey stay sober for more than a year

[02:42:15.980 --> 02:42:18.800]
Because he felt the center stuff program and secluded canyon location

[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:21.420]
Offered him the best chance of getting sober and staying alive

[02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:25.560]
Downey who still attends weekly meetings at wavelengths has been Vern's guardian angel

[02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:29.080]
Since the miniature movie star decided to turn his life around the friend told the inquire

[02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:32.080]
With all the respect that still rather have timmy from passions

[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:37.600]
Just looks like her eyes are gonna pop right out of her head

[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:44.200]
Vern feels he doesn't have to explain his feelings to Robert when Vern feels shaky turns to Robert to get him over the hump

[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:48.560]
Vern is allowed to leave the rehab center for various reasons and sometimes Robert meets up with him

[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:52.760]
He told Vern I'm there for you brother the hardest part is staying away from the temptations of this business

[02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:56.160]
And it goes on a great length but like you said who cares

[02:42:56.740 --> 02:42:58.740]
I'd rather have timmy still around wouldn't you?

[02:42:59.000 --> 02:42:59.480]
Oh yeah

[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:01.540]
You don't know from the other day

[02:43:01.540 --> 02:43:04.840]
He's been in a lot of things and he was in something else the other day and I don't remember what

[02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:05.340]
Oh the Grinch

[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:07.120]
You saw who the other day?

[02:43:07.320 --> 02:43:09.180]
Little Timmy in an older movie like the Grinch

[02:43:09.180 --> 02:43:10.840]
I think because I had never seen that

[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:12.240]
When's his new stuff coming out?

[02:43:13.900 --> 02:43:15.220]
Here's Miami, hello

[02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:16.200]
Hello

[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:17.040]
Yes sir

[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:23.760]
Hey I don't know if you saw your colleague last night on the sports camp prior to the Monday night game

[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:27.080]
But I don't know because they don't carry sports in here at all but never allowed

[02:43:27.080 --> 02:43:29.660]
Okay all right I forgot about that but anyways

[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:33.440]
It's to paraphrase the mad dog he was alright

[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:35.080]
He came out and said he goes

[02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:38.220]
Why can't we have a place where we can drink beer smoke to guard

[02:43:38.220 --> 02:43:42.280]
Make guy bodily function noises and just be ourselves

[02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:50.140]
And I would imagine that three hugging started a sipping people will be calling the show all afternoon

[02:43:50.140 --> 02:43:52.240]
So it's probably a great lead in for the show

[02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:54.700]
Probably going to have great numbers but he's right

[02:43:54.700 --> 02:43:57.540]
Why do people want to belong where they're not wanted?

[02:43:57.540 --> 02:44:01.960]
I mean I can understand if it was a thing where you're going to make money and it's restriction of trade

[02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:04.240]
But the social group and they don't want them

[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:07.380]
So in other words if they still didn't want black people there

[02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:10.840]
And he hangs up that's the end of that card so to come off

[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:12.320]
That's the end he told you what for

[02:44:12.320 --> 02:44:13.480]
Oh I see

[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:15.340]
And then he's quoting

[02:44:15.340 --> 02:44:20.320]
Get your own material by the way quoting the mad dog and chardonnay sipping whatever the other crap is you know

[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:22.100]
Which is just another huggers

[02:44:22.100 --> 02:44:22.620]
Yeah

[02:44:24.340 --> 02:44:27.360]
Just another homophobic slurers all that crap is you know

[02:44:27.360 --> 02:44:29.880]
Lighting the loafers, chardonnay sipping all the

[02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:33.420]
And not as much as these guys who want to sit around and belch and fart

[02:44:33.420 --> 02:44:35.600]
Guess what they do have those places it's called a bar

[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:42.580]
It's called a bar we're not talking about a pickup bar and by the way to kind of broads that they're going chasing after in the pickup bar

[02:44:42.580 --> 02:44:45.520]
I'm probably also belching and farting and doing the wrong thing there too

[02:44:48.020 --> 02:44:51.300]
And then you notice every time you bring up the thing and it's so obvious

[02:44:51.300 --> 02:44:52.900]
I mean it's right they're staring you in the face

[02:44:52.900 --> 02:44:55.700]
Here's the number one golfer in the world assuming golfer is important which it's not

[02:44:55.700 --> 02:44:57.080]
Here's the number one guy in the youth

[02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:00.040]
Who's heads and shoulders above everybody else

[02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:05.260]
Maybe the greatest of all time he's half black half Taiwanese or whatever it is mix and match

[02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:07.320]
Right a little more time other things thrown in there

[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:07.720]
Yeah

[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:13.560]
And not too many years ago I think what was it 11 years ago that they left the first black member in Augusta

[02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:15.960]
Not too many years ago they wouldn't know what his ass in there

[02:45:17.940 --> 02:45:22.720]
And they don't confuse us with the fact it's not the same he's a guy you know right

[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:23.420]
Right

[02:45:24.940 --> 02:45:29.880]
You're dealing with a bunch of bigoted redneck Yahoo's okay is what you're dealing with

[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:32.900]
And Amanda ought to be ashamed of himself

[02:45:34.900 --> 02:45:38.820]
Can't let us guys that yeah you can have it just don't expect the guy to be public

[02:45:38.820 --> 02:45:41.180]
The networks and the sponsors to subsidize it

[02:45:41.720 --> 02:45:45.320]
And if CBS sports decides that they want to go ahead and show it which they're going to do

[02:45:45.320 --> 02:45:48.980]
Then they're going to take a lot of flag from it which they deserve that's the way it works

[02:45:50.020 --> 02:45:53.340]
There's going to be a lot of people boycotting and marching and demonstrating and protesting

[02:45:53.340 --> 02:46:00.900]
Because that's the way things start unraveling that's how you get that's how you break down the barriers of prejudice and bigotry and stupidity

[02:46:01.580 --> 02:46:05.240]
And quite frankly if I want to be aligned even though she is a militant bitch this burqwoman

[02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:08.880]
If I want to be aligned with the cause I sure as I wouldn't want to be aligned with hoody Johnson

[02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:13.160]
And a bunch of Georgia rednecks a bunch of Yahoo's but I eat to eat its own

[02:46:15.660 --> 02:46:22.280]
26 past noon at the shardonnays sipping and all the same old trite lines get your own material that that's why he ran away so fast

[02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:25.500]
God forbid he should have to answer a question with his own response

[02:46:27.160 --> 02:46:32.440]
26 past noon at 560 WQM Thanksgiving everybody's going to be flocking home to be together again

[02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:34.760]
Even women are allowed I guess they got to do the cooking

[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:40.100]
Gathered around the table with delicious homemade food and family traditions after all it's not the turkey that makes the meal special

[02:46:40.100 --> 02:46:45.140]
It's the people getting ready for hungry guests can be really stressful especially if they be staying overnight

My life and love this is 4-0-5-6-1 way to go away

[02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:43.140]
I don't have a clue

[02:47:43.140 --> 02:47:58.140]
I used to think that I could not be on that day would keep quite because I'm a star

[02:47:59.140 --> 02:48:06.120]
And now the years are fast for copying for you

[02:48:07.140 --> 02:48:13.900]
As long as grass is on the plate you can feel you

[02:48:13.900 --> 02:48:24.800]
If I can see it can I can do it if I just believe it

[02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:37.000]
And they're my charades I'm a big petafide I believe I can touch my thigh

[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:48.800]
You can see it on video tape don't fear I'm more than tried to rage if her parents come home

[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:55.780]
You see me running through that open door I'm a big petafide

[02:48:55.780 --> 02:48:57.740]
How young is too young

[02:48:57.740 --> 02:49:04.260]
I'm a big petafide I'm a big petafide

[02:49:05.180 --> 02:49:11.980]
Property to it 560 WDQFC we don't have any women basically listen to this radio station because it's an all I'd say sports club

[02:49:11.980 --> 02:49:13.880]
But like you say a sports bar with a microphone

[02:49:15.340 --> 02:49:21.540]
And we have very few women especially compared to what we used to have and I would do we don't have a huge woman audience but we sure as hell had a lot more than we got now

[02:49:21.540 --> 02:49:22.160]
We have a couple of women

[02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:24.980]
We have just a smattering of women who are listening to the show now

[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:31.120]
And so it's very you know that's a popular thing to go on here and say oh yeah well these damn women try to bust into our thing

[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:35.060]
First of all talking about sitting around and belching and farting in the being guys

[02:49:35.060 --> 02:49:39.660]
That's hardly the image that the master is especially of all of golf tournaments that that gives

[02:49:39.660 --> 02:49:48.160]
People like Jack Nicholas and the Tiger Woods and his crowd this blue nose crowd they don't give the impression of the kind of guys that sit around like a farting in your face

[02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:48.960]
You see what I'm saying?

[02:49:50.020 --> 02:49:50.200]
Yeah

[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:54.740]
Find a sports bar okay that's the place to go good sports bar we like

[02:49:54.740 --> 02:49:59.820]
Yeah but that's Stogi mad dog in fact he does a show that that show this guy's talking about sports jam

[02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:02.080]
He's jamming in there on the in those bars

[02:50:02.660 --> 02:50:04.680]
Yeah he can fart and drink and booze it up

[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:06.980]
How about your green lizards and do whatever you want

[02:50:08.980 --> 02:50:13.100]
It's just a tragic excuse for a bunch of discriminatory assholes is what it is

[02:50:14.420 --> 02:50:17.840]
And maybe the fact that they figure that most of these women the golfers are diced anyway

[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:20.220]
That might be also lurking in the back of their minds you think?

[02:50:21.060 --> 02:50:22.760]
Oh no not in Joe Dent

[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:26.240]
Here's my knee B, tello

[02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:26.500]
Neil

[02:50:26.500 --> 02:50:27.380]
Yes sir

[02:50:27.380 --> 02:50:28.060]
How you doing?

[02:50:28.460 --> 02:50:28.660]
Okay

[02:50:28.660 --> 02:50:32.500]
Hey listen I'm gonna stop but my comment is saying I'm not a golf fan

[02:50:32.500 --> 02:50:36.800]
I didn't know who who who he Johnson was before all this stuff with a gutter

[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:37.740]
You didn't give a hoot?

[02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:42.140]
I didn't give a hoot but I have an opinion on it

[02:50:42.640 --> 02:50:45.440]
You know it is a private club

[02:50:46.500 --> 02:50:50.240]
I think you know I don't know I'm a Hispanic

[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:52.300]
I know he wouldn't accept me in his club

[02:50:52.300 --> 02:50:56.440]
But then again I wouldn't want to belong to a club that wouldn't accept me anyways

[02:50:57.660 --> 02:51:00.960]
That woman who's trying to bust on the doors of a gutter

[02:51:00.960 --> 02:51:04.280]
Why don't you just build their own golf club and have it just for women?

[02:51:04.960 --> 02:51:05.600]
I don't understand

[02:51:05.600 --> 02:51:08.620]
Yeah in fact I think probably Rosa Parks should have built her own bus too

[02:51:08.620 --> 02:51:17.080]
I mean it is you know if it was a public place and they were you know not allowing a certain group of people

[02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:20.660]
And then you know that's a problem

[02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:23.720]
No see this is like a dog chasing its tail okay

[02:51:23.720 --> 02:51:27.060]
And the guy that called from before from the beach is right it's a little stale news

[02:51:27.060 --> 02:51:30.380]
Because you know it just keeps saying the same thing over and over again

[02:51:30.380 --> 02:51:35.620]
A private club can do whatever they want but that doesn't mean that a major network should glorify it

[02:51:35.620 --> 02:51:39.880]
And put it on the ear and that major sponsors are the subsidized it that's what the issue is

[02:51:39.880 --> 02:51:42.500]
So you don't confuse a lot of these people with the real issues

[02:51:43.360 --> 02:51:47.360]
Which is why who did Johnson and his crew of Luna thick said

[02:51:47.360 --> 02:51:51.000]
Okay well we'll just dispense with the sponsors we'll put the bill ourselves this time

[02:51:52.320 --> 02:51:55.140]
That will eliminate the issue so that we don't have to cave in

[02:51:55.140 --> 02:51:56.960]
And let those then bitches get in here

[02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:02.620]
5670560.560 only AT&T line

[02:52:03.140 --> 02:52:06.680]
The jury wasn't told about when on his powerful painkiller oxy condone

[02:52:06.680 --> 02:52:09.380]
That one on ahead in her purse when she was arrested

[02:52:10.120 --> 02:52:14.260]
The morphine the derivative is so popular on the streets is known as hillbilly heroin

[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:16.740]
You got any? Yeah

[02:52:16.740 --> 02:52:19.880]
But because when on his doctor gave her the oxy codone?

[02:52:24.160 --> 02:52:25.120]
Oxy condone

[02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:27.200]
Do you think I'd be having a problem to be reading here man?

[02:52:27.620 --> 02:52:29.360]
Maybe. Oxy codone

[02:52:30.420 --> 02:52:32.120]
OXY COD ONE

[02:52:32.120 --> 02:52:33.240]
Sender to her to that.

[02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:34.240]
Schmuck

[02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:37.400]
Boy I'm telling you you're mumbling man

[02:52:37.900 --> 02:52:41.920]
But because when on his doctor gave her the oxy codone the judges missed a penalty drug possession

[02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:43.780]
Charger was originally brought against the anchors

[02:52:43.780 --> 02:52:47.340]
However as the inquire recently revealed the physician is being investigated by authorities

[02:52:47.920 --> 02:52:52.320]
Another knowledgeable source is supposed to be inquire the judge Eldon Fox knows of when on his drug problems

[02:52:52.320 --> 02:52:54.400]
Because he saw all the charges and motions filed

[02:52:54.400 --> 02:52:56.320]
And although he refused to allow it into evidence

[02:52:56.320 --> 02:52:59.020]
He also knows he's been suspected of shoplifting be full

[02:52:59.660 --> 02:53:02.400]
Judge Fox ruled against letting jurors hear about the prior alleged acts

[02:53:02.400 --> 02:53:07.960]
But he since released court transcripts that revealed the sticky fingered star was suspected of stealing from other high end departments

[02:53:07.960 --> 02:53:09.400]
Through it before her arrested sacks

[02:53:09.400 --> 02:53:14.740]
The girl interrupted heroin was never charged for the two alleged incidents at Barney's and one at Neiman Marcus

[02:53:14.740 --> 02:53:17.140]
The information was released to the press of ember 10

[02:53:17.140 --> 02:53:20.360]
But the inquire published the accusations for their month before in early October

[02:53:20.360 --> 02:53:21.580]
Well, let's hear it for the inquire

[02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:24.600]
But they sure like to pat themselves on the back don't they?

[02:53:25.240 --> 02:53:25.700]
All the time

[02:53:25.700 --> 02:53:29.660]
The next big hurdle for Winona is her December 6th sentencing said the knowledgeable source

[02:53:29.660 --> 02:53:32.400]
Even though the prosecutor is not asking for jail time

[02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:35.140]
The judge could send her to jail for up to three years and could have happened

[02:53:35.800 --> 02:53:40.920]
To stay out of jail Winona must be able to show him she's been doing something to deal with both her shoplifting and drug problems

[02:53:40.920 --> 02:53:44.000]
Friends and even a juror interviewed by the inquire after the trial

[02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.740]
Hope the talented beauty queen comes to grips with their problem

[02:53:46.740 --> 02:53:47.840]
They wondered to grip it

[02:53:48.340 --> 02:53:52.040]
I think the embarrassment of the public trial in fact that she was found guilty may scare Winona sober

[02:53:52.040 --> 02:53:54.400]
Said the juror my guess is that Winona's learned her lesson

[02:53:54.400 --> 02:53:56.320]
That'd be surprised if she ever shoplets again

[02:53:56.780 --> 02:53:58.220]
How do you like that? And you know something?

[02:53:58.520 --> 02:53:59.460]
I still don't give a crap

[02:53:59.460 --> 02:54:03.260]
No, I'd rather hear about Dave Ryder than Winona Ryder

[02:54:03.260 --> 02:54:07.680]
I'd rather hear about Mitch Ryder and the Detroit wheels than Winona Ryder

[02:54:07.680 --> 02:54:08.360]
Small potatoes

[02:54:09.880 --> 02:54:11.240]
Here's a call from the Grove. Hello

[02:54:11.720 --> 02:54:12.620]
Hey, how's it going?

[02:54:12.940 --> 02:54:13.300]
Okay

[02:54:14.020 --> 02:54:16.960]
I was going to make a comment about the master's thing

[02:54:17.380 --> 02:54:22.400]
I think you hit it on the head when you did say it is a private facility and they are going to flip the bill

[02:54:23.320 --> 02:54:28.560]
If you look at some of the other things that deal with women and I guess you're talking about homosexuality

[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:31.300]
The Boy South America don't allow homosexuals

[02:54:31.960 --> 02:54:33.480]
But will they make them out of big issue?

[02:54:34.540 --> 02:54:36.480]
Well, Winona, who is making it a big issue?

[02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:38.340]
Anybody in the general media?

[02:54:38.340 --> 02:54:40.180]
Of course they made it a big issue

[02:54:40.180 --> 02:54:44.720]
That's one of the reasons that they lost their funding all the way in states and counties all around the country

[02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:45.140]
All right

[02:54:45.140 --> 02:54:50.560]
And then the next thing you look at is say the citadel they didn't accept women

[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:51.160]
Yeah

[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:55.920]
And the reason they didn't accept women is because they said they didn't have to pay for it

[02:54:55.920 --> 02:54:56.340]
Yeah

[02:54:56.340 --> 02:55:02.620]
Well the states told them that they didn't allow women that the state funding was going to go away

[02:55:02.620 --> 02:55:03.320]
Uh-huh

[02:55:03.320 --> 02:55:06.400]
The citadel couldn't afford it so they had to accept women

[02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:09.460]
And there's a whole bunch of women in there, a whole bunch of cadets

[02:55:09.460 --> 02:55:15.440]
Right, now the masters can afford the pay for because they are a private organization they can flip the bill

[02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:19.060]
How come there is a one of you people that wants to continue defending this?

[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:21.180]
There is a one of you who will respond to my question

[02:55:21.180 --> 02:55:24.240]
If Tiger Woods were not permitted in there because he was black

[02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:25.920]
Do you think that CBS would televised it?

[02:55:27.140 --> 02:55:28.520]
I'm sure they probably would

[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:34.480]
It's the longest running name one other major golf championship that's been at the same golf course

[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:35.420]
But within its entirety

[02:55:35.420 --> 02:55:37.220]
Oh my god

[02:55:37.220 --> 02:55:39.780]
You know something I give up

[02:55:39.780 --> 02:55:41.500]
I'm right there that call

[02:55:41.500 --> 02:55:42.640]
Bottle it

[02:55:43.380 --> 02:55:45.220]
Preserve it, freeze dry it

[02:55:45.220 --> 02:55:46.680]
Put it in the old callostomy bag

[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:50.480]
That call is everything that's wrong with this radio station is people like that

[02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:54.640]
This guy is even better than the guy who said to mad dog after that big weekend

[02:55:54.640 --> 02:55:57.420]
The Miami winover hood hello was FSU

[02:55:57.420 --> 02:56:01.500]
And the uh-herk and the dolphin went over Denver that weekend about four or five weeks back

[02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:04.060]
Aren't we blessed to be here at South Florida Jim?

[02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:07.640]
I've talked to people all across the country are we blessed you guys are idiots

[02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:08.880]
You're moms

[02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:13.180]
You're simpleton what differences make if it's the longest running tournament

[02:56:13.180 --> 02:56:15.140]
Well what the hell does that have to do with anything?

[02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:18.740]
What does that mean?

[02:56:21.820 --> 02:56:24.380]
That's like saying well you know the uh- the New York Yankee

[02:56:24.380 --> 02:56:27.560]
The Boston Red Sauce whichever one came first is the longest running uh-

[02:56:27.560 --> 02:56:29.600]
Baseball organization in history of major league baseball

[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:33.940]
Therefore we can't let uh- you know the Jackie Robinson join the Dodgers or whatever the hell you see what I'm saying

[02:56:33.940 --> 02:56:36.280]
Oh no where's the logic in that

[02:56:38.340 --> 02:56:44.040]
And this guy's got the hood for the balls to say to me that he believes that if they didn't let Tiger Woods enter because he was black

[02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:45.740]
That CBS would still televised it

[02:56:45.740 --> 02:56:48.060]
You better bet your ass they wouldn't televised it mister

[02:56:48.060 --> 02:56:51.320]
And there wouldn't be one person on this radio station defending that

[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:53.260]
If they didn't let him in there

[02:56:56.180 --> 02:57:00.620]
So you pick and choose who you want to discriminate against and let me say it again make it very clear

[02:57:00.620 --> 02:57:03.480]
They got to write to do whatever the hell they want all those red next up in Augusta

[02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:08.000]
But that doesn't mean that the public should subsidize it or the never should embrace it

[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:09.720]
It's a disgrace

[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:14.820]
Can you can you relate to that mentality?

[02:57:15.060 --> 02:57:17.580]
It's the longest running golf tournament what does that mean?

[02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:18.940]
I'm kind of figuring it out

[02:57:18.940 --> 02:57:20.000]
Well what does it prove?

[02:57:22.460 --> 02:57:26.880]
There's been slavery going on for two thousand years to to that that does that mean we should perpetuate it?

[02:57:26.900 --> 02:57:27.040]
Sure

[02:57:27.620 --> 02:57:32.800]
And the classic church is the oldest Christian church in the world therefore they should be able to do whatever they want

[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:34.160]
Yeah

[02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:35.760]
Well the Jews were here first mister

[02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:38.400]
Oh the Zoroastrians were here before them

[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:39.180]
Exactly

[02:57:40.900 --> 02:57:41.860]
Twenty to one

[02:57:41.860 --> 02:57:47.960]
Oh that just I'm seriously I'm weak I'm weak from that I feel like El Martino I'm weak

[02:58:53.380 --> 02:58:54.720]

[02:58:56.380 --> 02:58:58.220]
Looking for glory holes

One of those ten pounds this weekend ten forty eight

[02:59:01.120 --> 02:59:07.260]
The Hollywood forty eight hour miracle diet I lost ten pounds but it was no miracle that's not the sour milk

[02:59:07.260 --> 02:59:11.280]
It was forty eight hours of hell I peoped for forty eight hours straight

[02:59:11.280 --> 02:59:16.520]
I peaked so hard my soul fell out lose up to ten pounds safely in forty eight hours

[02:59:16.520 --> 02:59:20.840]
If you can chunks your own liver was an Olympic event I would have brought home the goal

[02:59:23.920 --> 02:59:30.780]
That's all I feel right now maybe nothing 1245 is 560 WQ and 650 most which TV network slants the news the most

[02:59:32.300 --> 02:59:38.780]
Fox 228 228 all of them on 56 CNN 89 CBS 70 NBC 69

[02:59:39.740 --> 02:59:45.780]
ABC I mean what a drop off ABC 20 MS NBC's got 12 that's a whole audience none of them six

[02:59:46.820 --> 02:59:50.780]
So what do you think don't you think that because the masters have been there so long making pick and choose and on

[02:59:50.780 --> 02:59:55.560]
The CBS ought to be there with bells on huh and we all have to be sitting around let's face it I don't care what you say

[02:59:55.560 --> 03:00:02.260]
But it's started on me again that all these macho heterosexual males that hell of a lot of them don't like women

[03:00:03.160 --> 03:00:09.360]
You notice that yeah George they like using they like using them for whatever purposes they can go up

[03:00:09.360 --> 03:00:14.120]
I got a great length to stay away from I wouldn't say you I just said comma George

[03:00:14.880 --> 03:00:18.340]
You're taking it like so personal this is business and you're taking it personal

[03:00:19.260 --> 03:00:20.560]
Here's Miami hello

[03:00:30.800 --> 03:00:36.860]
Hope yeah the coach he accepted his membership but they actually he's a little boy

[03:00:36.860 --> 03:00:43.560]
Yeah I guess but they actually turned down Chris Bush because you had a crush on him

[03:00:44.540 --> 03:00:52.260]
Oh he's starting to get out of it oh man a voice from the past don't go away mad pal just go away

[03:01:07.500 --> 03:01:12.520]
No I haven't heard a word not the only thing I read was that psychotic piece by Cheryl Seal

[03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:18.160]
But what is the what word are you going to hear what's the word you're going to hear

[03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:23.100]
Not going to hear anything but the whole government change if I was a little more member of the Supreme Court I'd be pretty scared right now

[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:28.400]
Yeah well you're pretty scared all the way they're going to you have to be scared

[03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:35.260]
Now that we got these people in there confirm all these right-wing judges it's just a matter of time before they die off they don't have to off anybody

[03:01:35.800 --> 03:01:45.540]
Not that this guy's paranoid or anything like that 5 6 7 but this last hour if you do it's like you move it like that you know this yeah I know it's pretty good as a matter of fact

[03:01:45.540 --> 03:01:54.140]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 you're just one of those guys you're just sucking up to them women out there you're one of them you know sucking up to them bull bikes

[03:01:54.140 --> 03:02:02.040]
That's what it's all about you're not a real man like the other people on your radio station right remember the day we took the pool on this thing

[03:02:02.040 --> 03:02:09.040]
There was a month ago yeah but the whether they should be forced to require to keep a all no it's a private club they're being but

[03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:15.380]
They want and it's not forgot that it was the oldest continue was running golf tournament excuse me if I would have known that

[03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:23.600]
Here's Kendall hello I need to know how you doing okay very long time since I spoke to you I listen to you every day

[03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:31.520]
I'm actually code on in that you know what that is percassette okay so there's a difference there's oxy content and then there's oxy

[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:37.480]
Code on which is the generic name so and then there's oxy moron and there she is so yes he definitely in a hard

[03:02:37.480 --> 03:02:42.880]
Quick stuff and for some reason doctors freak out more about percassette and let's say bike it and her other you know pain

[03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:48.740]
Related like that I don't know why they always make such a big deal about that small potatoes I don't know what the big deal is with her any what an idiot

[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:57.400]
And that guy who called about the G well it's been that way for so long why don't we just leave the school he's out of the club yeah ridiculous love you

[03:02:57.400 --> 03:03:04.060]
See ya I mean that's basically what the guy is saying and he has the balls to tell me that if they didn't allow black people in

[03:03:04.060 --> 03:03:09.060]
Including Tiger Woods CBS would still go ahead and tell them is it because it's been on their log name on his wall

[03:03:09.060 --> 03:03:17.180]
Shut the CBS I wrote off the air if they did that you crazy you see you sports nerds out there you don't understand

[03:03:17.180 --> 03:03:23.140]
Though I know this comes as a tremendous shock and you may have to sit down and like you strap yourself in for a couple of minutes

[03:03:23.140 --> 03:03:28.500]
But the world doesn't revolve around your silliness. I know that comes as a tremendous shock yeah

[03:03:29.460 --> 03:03:37.180]
But the world doesn't revolve around your golf games and your ball games and your slacked grab ass and hazing and all

[03:03:37.180 --> 03:03:43.680]
So it doesn't revolve around that crap in fact most people who have reached the maturity level beyond the age of like 17

[03:03:43.680 --> 03:03:47.920]
Laugh at a lot of that crap or are embarrassed by it or both

[03:03:49.660 --> 03:03:54.620]
Well you know Jim that's a good slap in the slap ass that's just part of the game you know

[03:03:55.800 --> 03:04:00.160]
We you know what we should have a treasure trove of some of these great calls

[03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:06.680]
Far surpass any collection of comedy bits that we could ever make some of these just unbelievable calls

[03:04:08.180 --> 03:04:12.920]
Oh yeah well you know it's just part of the game these guys slapping each other on the butt you know it's just part of the game

[03:04:14.040 --> 03:04:16.100]
Yeah I know what's game they're talking about like we said

[03:04:18.720 --> 03:04:22.840]
Faggery that's usually part of the game I know it's about put your hand on some guys

[03:04:23.460 --> 03:04:29.120]
Rack them ass but anyway don't confuse these people with the facts they get very uptight

[03:04:29.120 --> 03:04:33.980]
And then they start to start analyzing these things well maybe it doesn't make a lot of sense but it's just the way it is you know

[03:04:33.980 --> 03:04:40.260]
It's just the way guys act like that hazing thing that you're all upset about it's just boys being boys don't you understand it?

[03:04:40.280 --> 03:04:44.120]
Oh yeah I understand it they want to like rip off got other guys underwear and you know

[03:04:44.120 --> 03:04:49.620]
Examine their private parts and fondle their genitals and writing on her ass and stick ballpoint pens in their

[03:04:49.620 --> 03:04:56.300]
Just not being guys man just because it happens to be between the navel and these it's just one of those things

[03:04:57.540 --> 03:05:05.440]
10 to 1 560 WQM your silly sports station it's your silly station for silly people

[03:05:06.700 --> 03:05:09.320]
And that's why we do so well because there's a lot of silly people out there

[03:05:10.220 --> 03:05:14.780]
If I were to know it was the longest running golf tournament I think I'd probably change my whole attitude you know it

[03:05:15.680 --> 03:05:18.940]
Well I lowered my chair right down to the goddamn flow now that you know

[03:05:19.480 --> 03:05:24.900]
Oral med no matter whether you're black white purple in between or you might good stuff to pop in your post

[03:05:24.900 --> 03:05:31.120]
Oral mediterranean formulas are advanced combinations of pharmaceutical grade olive oil combined with great stuff

[03:05:31.120 --> 03:05:35.300]

Hey, what's up?

Hey, what's up buddy?

[03:07:00.860 --> 03:07:02.660]
How's my hundred dog friend?

[03:07:02.660 --> 03:07:05.200]
Okay, what's going on?

[03:07:05.560 --> 03:07:06.500]
What about sports?

[03:07:06.680 --> 03:07:08.980]
Yeah, not much in this town man

Yeah

[03:07:13.560 --> 03:07:13.660]
Yeah

[03:07:14.420 --> 03:07:14.860]
Yeah

[03:07:16.600 --> 03:07:19.220]
Bob in new hot plate today

Well, that's good my hundred dog friend.

[03:07:22.220 --> 03:07:22.900]
Thanks there.

[03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:25.860]
Hey, you want to feel like a man like a sports man?

[03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:27.400]
Yeah, sports kind of guy.

[03:07:27.540 --> 03:07:27.800]
Sure.

[03:07:28.060 --> 03:07:29.720]
All right, you ready?

[03:07:30.120 --> 03:07:31.420]
Yeah, I'm ready.

[03:07:31.420 --> 03:07:32.740]
I'll start okay?

[03:07:33.360 --> 03:07:35.060]
Okay, here we go.

[03:07:35.820 --> 03:08:02.660]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[03:08:02.660 --> 03:08:15.320]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey or hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, me or hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, me or hey, hey, me or hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, fault your idols for fear and death weekend

[03:08:15.320 --> 03:08:31.840]
Ah, I never got to this shoreity well, but hang out a little we увидyst so many of you

[03:08:31.840 --> 03:08:32.640]
when I went shopping and I don't get into that stuff and I realized this got an easy problem

[03:08:32.640 --> 03:08:34.760]
You notice the one that actually got a little bit of response?

[03:08:36.640 --> 03:08:36.960]
Yeah.

[03:08:37.320 --> 03:08:41.600]
Was this one about Augusta or the Masters and about, wow, you know, and Erwin Xusana the son.

[03:08:41.680 --> 03:08:44.200]
It's a private club and it's the longest run and continues to go off to them.

[03:08:44.260 --> 03:08:46.680]
And therefore, but it'd be pitiful, pitiful, op, etc. and so on.

[03:08:48.280 --> 03:08:50.840]
It's called rationalizing the irrational.

[03:08:52.420 --> 03:08:55.180]
In addition to which, who really gives a crap when you come right down to it?

[03:08:55.560 --> 03:08:58.900]
I just brought it up because of that one story, which was about the hundredth thing I had in there today.

[03:08:58.900 --> 03:09:02.600]
Nobody responds to anything else I'm talking about, which is usual. I expect that.

[03:09:03.120 --> 03:09:06.780]
But this is the one they all come out because this is a guy thing, baby.

[03:09:07.240 --> 03:09:10.240]
Like that great sports show that I used to be on opposite us on the fan.

[03:09:10.500 --> 03:09:10.960]
Remember that show?

[03:09:11.380 --> 03:09:11.660]
I remember.

[03:09:12.060 --> 03:09:16.160]
And the sales crew, certain ones which I don't want to mention in my name, running around building saying,

[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:18.100]
oh yeah, those two live Jews on it.

[03:09:18.260 --> 03:09:20.520]
That's a real, that's a guy show. It's a man show.

[03:09:20.720 --> 03:09:21.900]
They talk about teddy bars.

[03:09:22.180 --> 03:09:23.100]
That's a guy show.

[03:09:23.180 --> 03:09:24.280]
That's going to kick that Neal's ass.

[03:09:24.920 --> 03:09:25.820]
Anybody heard the family?

[03:09:26.200 --> 03:09:26.440]
No.

[03:09:26.440 --> 03:09:28.620]
They're not even on the air anymore in English.

[03:09:30.480 --> 03:09:32.500]
But that's the mentality that you deal with.

[03:09:32.860 --> 03:09:35.840]
It's this women hating super macho.

[03:09:37.140 --> 03:09:39.240]
And these people are deluding themselves.

[03:09:40.740 --> 03:09:41.860]
Let me say it again.

[03:09:42.020 --> 03:09:46.480]
Guys that want to take showers together and run around naked together and slap each other

[03:09:46.480 --> 03:09:47.380]
any ass with towels.

[03:09:47.760 --> 03:09:50.500]
There's something that seems a little bit amiss there.

[03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:51.200]
You know what I'm talking about?

[03:09:51.380 --> 03:09:52.420]
Underline the missed part.

[03:09:53.700 --> 03:09:56.420]
Something that seems a little bit off-kilter to me.

[03:09:57.320 --> 03:09:58.220]
But then again, what do I know?

[03:09:58.340 --> 03:09:59.440]
You know, being the old fag that I'm?

[03:09:59.560 --> 03:10:00.380]
Well, what I know about that.

[03:10:00.520 --> 03:10:01.080]
About Faggery.

[03:10:01.800 --> 03:10:02.060]
Plenty.

[03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:06.260]
But don't confuse these people with the facts.

[03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:08.520]
And you just watch there'll be a platter of call.

[03:10:08.920 --> 03:10:11.400]
Oh, Tigers got more important things to worry about than that.

[03:10:11.640 --> 03:10:17.100]
He should be the first one with all the millions and millions he's made playing a stupid goddamn game called golf.

[03:10:17.320 --> 03:10:19.480]
He should be the first one standing up for everybody else's rights.

[03:10:20.980 --> 03:10:25.320]
And the last time they made it a big semi-sider, what's the big golfer in over there in England that they have?

[03:10:25.420 --> 03:10:26.760]
What is that?

[03:10:27.620 --> 03:10:28.000]
What is that?

[03:10:28.480 --> 03:10:29.260]
Come on, Carlos.

[03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:30.200]
Is that the British open?

[03:10:30.840 --> 03:10:31.700]
Whatever it is.

[03:10:32.240 --> 03:10:33.600]
Well, he's too busy playing over there.

[03:10:33.700 --> 03:10:34.360]
He don't have time.

[03:10:34.460 --> 03:10:35.820]
He's got a concentrate on his golf.

[03:10:36.100 --> 03:10:37.460]
It's kind of like, remember the Brian Blades thing.

[03:10:37.620 --> 03:10:38.860]
He don't have time to be talking now.

[03:10:38.980 --> 03:10:40.880]
He's busy running fast and jumping high.

[03:10:42.200 --> 03:10:42.720]
Remember that?

[03:10:43.260 --> 03:10:43.460]
Right.

[03:10:43.900 --> 03:10:45.480]
He don't have time to answer any questions.

[03:10:47.260 --> 03:10:50.600]
670 votes on our poll, which TV network slants the news the most?

[03:10:50.880 --> 03:10:51.200]
Fox!

[03:10:51.960 --> 03:10:53.880]
You're a macho right wing station.

[03:10:54.220 --> 03:10:56.040]
The Ethan Fox standing for fascist.

[03:10:56.260 --> 03:10:59.360]
And isn't it great that we fought out some real insightful stuff about our good friend Heather today?

[03:11:00.100 --> 03:11:00.340]
Yeah.

[03:11:00.720 --> 03:11:02.140]
Heather that didn't bet from the fight.

[03:11:02.360 --> 03:11:02.960]
She's a nothing.

[03:11:03.240 --> 03:11:03.980]
Stuff and nods.

[03:11:03.980 --> 03:11:06.600]
The Condoleezza liquor, who didn't even know her name a little while ago.

[03:11:07.120 --> 03:11:09.260]
Fox 238, all of them 159.

[03:11:09.900 --> 03:11:11.920]
CNN 92, CBS 71.

[03:11:12.460 --> 03:11:13.920]
NBC, and it's just changing again.

[03:11:13.920 --> 03:11:16.140]
By the time we can't afford to be changing, damn it.

[03:11:16.440 --> 03:11:20.860]
NBC 70, ABC only 21, MSNBC 13, that's their whole audience.

[03:11:21.260 --> 03:11:23.060]
And none of them be saying six.

[03:11:23.440 --> 03:11:25.740]
Mad Dog standing by next, he's got his kilts on today.

[03:11:25.820 --> 03:11:26.700]
Bye, bye, bye!

[03:11:27.100 --> 03:11:31.380]
The new weather show on 5-S in the evening QAM by NB4L day.
