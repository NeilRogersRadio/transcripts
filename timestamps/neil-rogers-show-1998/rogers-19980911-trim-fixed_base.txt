everybody was a black guy is a minister so there are several black religious

[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.980]
leaders including the uncle Jesse Robert bird I'll get back to him but at any

[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.100]
rate so as the president was reading a prayer because somebody down here in

[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.260]
Florida when he was here today for a buddy okay he said some of Jewish guys

[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:32.620]
some Jew gave him a passage from a young kipper liturgy which you know kipper's

[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.560]

[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.160]
the liturgy doing this prayer thing a lot of the black guys in the audience

[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.720]

[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.840]

[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.580]
at football prayer breakfast all right yeah I might it sure would know look at

[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.900]
the markets of 110 points now because the president finally came clean

[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.420]
sports court and like I said and they're saying the same thing if he wouldn't

[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.900]
done this back on August 17th when he came on TV that night but of course he's

[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.200]
gotten a lot of bad advice from way back at the beginning instead of make it

[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.580]
as Paula Jones thing go away which would have been the smart thing to do oh no

[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.360]
we're not gonna do that we've been ahead of it we could have been spared the whole

[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.600]
world could have been spared this embarrassment and at two o'clock this afternoon

[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.200]
there is gonna be a bunch of salacious crap on there this is one of the most

[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.820]
incredible embarrassing grotesque witch hunts in the history of the human race

[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:43.140]
not just in this country but in his long sad arduous history of mankind from

[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.920]
the day that this man was sworn in as for and before that of course long before

[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.680]
that with the Jennifer flowers stuff before got the nomination back during

[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.600]
democratic primaries in 91 they have been anxious to whip his ass out of it they've

[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.460]
tried to spend fifteen to sixty million dollars now on this so which hunt have

[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.280]
they found any criminal activity on anything other than connected with sexual

[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.240]
activities no no and go back to this Robert bird asshole in this craft how how

[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.900]
come Larry King who's sitting there supposed to be a yes besides just an ass

[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.200]
liquor is he anything besides an ass liquor no he's not how come a Robert bird

[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.940]
make this a rages comment about things that have happened and I don't think

[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.120]
there was any TV what FDR was screwing around there in a white house was there

[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.100]
any TV when George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were screwing around no

[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.640]
were there any movies then no I mean what are we talking about let's always blame

[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.260]
somebody else the fact is that people sex lives tend to be sorted not everybody

[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:46.340]
but most people screw around oh my god you can't well it happens to be true and

[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.740]
what the hell that has to do you know in Italy you know what they were saying

[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.340]
about this yesterday is great is good in Italy that they ought to be giving him an

[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.960]
award that throughout the end of his of him that over there they would like

[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.860]
I'll canonize him because he's getting a good stuff on the side what else

[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:07.280]
wrong with that I mean he may have that taste and his selection of women including

[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:17.880]
good old Monica bitch who keeps a semen stained dress I mean I didn't throw

[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:30.040]
anything away I threw nothing away it's all piled up it's in there prick

[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:38.700]
brimes with yeah for this bitch for this wild witch hunt we wouldn't have we

[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.220]
could have inspired all of us and we could be addressing the other problems

[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.260]
that are causing the world economy to go out hell on a hand basket since there

[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.440]
are more important goddamn things to be warned about the one for the Yankees

[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.020]
are going to win 116 games stuff like that whether they orcones are going to be

[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.940]
another girl school I know that comes to the shock on his station but it happens

[00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:00.240]
to be true that was up 112 points how do you like that went from down eighty eight

[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.720]
before his end am I suggesting there's a correlation air you bet because this

[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.900]
whole thing with the everybody is in having a nervous breakdown of the economic

[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:13.040]
situation in the world so the the psyche of investors is so fragile at this

[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.440]
point that the slighted if somebody fart and it smells the wrong flavor right away

[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:22.060]
the market goes down 400 more points so we can thank and he even apologize to

[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.580]
her and her family which I thought was totally unnecessary so she ought to be

[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.400]
out there she should have been a prayer breakfast reading the young kipper

[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.940]
liturgy she should have been begging for forgiveness because she's the slug

[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:37.340]
that is a psychotic insane that is ready to bring down the whole goddamn

[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.940]
government because a building now you know leave Hillary and run off with

[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.600]
monarchy the summer eyes are sunset or someplace he's not for rocker he's

[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.780]
crazier than a bed bug he ought to shadow of a doubt that this is nothing but a

[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.920]
political which on number one and not releasing any of the other desperately

[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.080]
screaming and begging for them to a release the a four hundred and forty five

[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.200]
pages to the White House before to a clock before the rest of the world gets it

[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.480]
oh well yeah you guys can get it on the internet like everybody else so there's

[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.520]
no politics involved in this at all is that of course not had a laugh I'm watching

[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.580]
Henry Hyde at the beginning of this committee they had last night the House

[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.820]
committee Henry Hyde and John Conjures and Henry Hyde sits down there oh and well

[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.700]

[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.680]
any politics in a partisanship and rugby but and I'm sitting there just

[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.200]
peeing in my pants laughing like who the hell are we kidding like that isn't what

[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.640]

[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.480]
weren't an absolute madman now he's threatening he's gonna have indictments

[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.060]
against Betty Curry and against the secret service and against this one and

[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.080]
that one and everybody that the president they ever spoke to because they're

[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.320]
all part of this big conspiracy for a cover up to cover up what oh well the

[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.020]
president lied was advised there's no other people in the white house what do

[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.280]

there anybody who like is the boss in a company you got a secretary what was

[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.420]
he supposed to say oh you know that Monica gave the best head I've had in a

[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:06.600]
long time he's gonna say that to Betty Curry is that the deal I mean we're

[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.740]
talking here about a sexual escut series of sexual escu-pays by a man who

[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.520]
already we know was a womanizer before he was elected the first time before

[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.520]
he was elected the second time and for months now people have been saying

[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.920]
enough of this crap we want out of this we don't care we can't stand it and

[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.200]
yet Kenneth star and the people who have prompted me to that position are now

[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.500]
on the virgin about three and a half hours of releasing the most humiliating

[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.880]
possible crap that you could possibly imagine and if it weren't politically

[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.780]
motivated why the hell would we need to know would anybody need to know the

[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.960]
details the things she's masturbating with a cigar and they're doing it in the

[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.440]
limo and he touched her and she touched him and it did constitute but it'd be

[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:51.060]
fun to move but why is all that necessary unless of course there's an attempt to

[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.080]
absolutely totally humiliate an embarrassed and make it impossible for Bill Clinton

[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.520]
to continue to be the president that's what this is all about is there anybody in

[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:07.220]
this audience anybody who'd like to have a 445 page report put on the

[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:12.580]

[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.420]
have to do with anything that this man was elected for is that anybody's

[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.480]
business was was rose to fellow womanizer was Kennedy and Eisenhower and Nixon

[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.360]
had a mistress and every other guy day month going by all the way back to George

[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.640]
Washington with his wooden teeth we've reached the point in this country where

[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.660]
the media are so insane and they're they're the ones without the media can it

[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.740]
start could never have gone anywhere without this seven month feeding

[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.340]
frenzy that's gone on now it's almost nine months now what a pregnant idea

[00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.080]
where they have banged on this and banged on this and you people out there

[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.560]
said we don't want to hear about this we can't stand it reminds me of this

[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.740]
place there are real problems going on out there and you're dealing with crap

[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.300]
reminds me of a Q.A.M. there are real problems you need to be dealing with and

[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.500]
you're dealing with cock-a

[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.880]
you're so sweet as when this comes out all these sanctum of the Pacific

[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.060]
Ritz are going to be oh my god can you believe oh look at that look at where

[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:29.640]
she stuck this and he stopped that oh my gosh what did he generate and so he

[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.320]
was forced of course under a lot of pressure and it would have been very bad

[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.720]
advice if he would have given that same speech that he gave in his prayer

[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.740]
breakfast at the White House this morning back at August 17th everybody in

[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.720]
America would have had a tear in your eye including even a nude

[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.420]
gingrich and even at Orin's snatch would have been like doing a three-hanky

[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:49.280]
job men would have said oh we forgive you we understand we love it because of

[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.000]
course this is the way that the goyam think anyway right we love the center

[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.120]
when he confesses his sin there's nothing greater just like Jimmy Swagger remember

[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.340]
that craft that good old religious Jimmy Swagger Hifakrit now they're sanctum

[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.460]
of the Pacific Ritz and he came back I have a sand and he's crying in the

[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.000]
army crying in the army because there's no money coming in that's what that

[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.280]
was all about but boy they sure love after they confess their sins and so

[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.360]
that's what the president was reduced to this morning having to be humanized

[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.400]
and humiliate himself and apologize to people to whom he was no apology

[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.700]
there's no apology to Monica Lewinsky she went there with her knee pads she

[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.300]
went there pull out her friends and I forgot to get the damn thing out there

[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:34.900]
that you got piled up with all kinds of crap on told him every kind of she was

[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.840]
doing everything in her power to flirt with the president get as a

[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.500]
notorious womanizer who liked going out there playing golf with Vernon Jordan

[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:47.660]
talking about see all the time like most guys do I mean wake up and grow off

[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:52.060]
America okay I hate to break the news to you this is what people do and this is

[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:58.360]
what people talk about is their sexual exploits only usually we're not

[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:05.900]
dealing with insane crazy bitches like Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp who have

[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.460]
no concern about the magnitude or the implications of their actions or their

[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.820]
words who couldn't give a crap less the scorned woman that's the one to look

[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:17.160]
out for baby the scorn bitch that's the one you better watch out for a

[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.440]
fucking bitch because she's ready to bring your house hold down in this case the

[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.580]
whole goddamn government come tumbling down and put us through all of this

[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:29.940]
expense all of this emotional crap and that's exactly what it is we've gone

[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.840]
through nine solid months in this country of nothing but every time you turn

[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.120]
on your TV you can't escape it no matter where you turn and I've tried to

[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.980]
avoid we talk very little about it thank God because there's nothing amusing

[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:45.180]
and oh yeah there be people laughing and shortly when the stuff comes out of

[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.760]
two o'clock today when you get on the internet they start hopping through if

[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.260]
they ever get through on that thing they start sifting through the 445

[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.440]
pages and get to those juicy it's like people that used to be lady chatter

[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.140]
with his lover and they know skip skip around till they got to the good parts I

[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.940]
mean who now wants to read the whole damn thing it's two-time consuming let's get

[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.220]
to the good parts the juicy stuff and they'll be charting and puking and

[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.600]
defying oh my god this is hysterical great stuff and let me say it again I

[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.700]
wonder because I know from personal experience believe me all these people

[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.540]
over all the years that I've been on the year like way back when I came out of

[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:22.780]
the closet December 76 oh yeah faggot this and that pervert yeah and and what's

[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:28.280]
the bullet and what's the new story see pervert is a relative thing it's a

[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.020]
relative thing and I guarantee I'm a hell of a lot less pervert than most of

[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.760]
you are all we're giving the opportunity well

[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:42.220]
bunch of sanctimonious phony hypocrites because America has refused and

[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:47.320]
continues to refuse to grow effing up here's this wolf blitzkrieg there here's

[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.320]
these media people out of control and a feeding frenzy there was sam dom I'm

[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.180]
gonna tell you I will never as long as I live as long as I live I will never

[00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:02.260]
watch another piece on ABC news of under penalty of death their credibility is

[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:07.320]
worse than our news department we don't even have one they have no credibility

[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:11.940]
here was sam domelson yesterday when the president came out to announce that the

[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.780]
Northwest Airlines strike was over it just foaming at them out in a feeding

[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:21.060]
frenzy oh but every opportunity because there are a bunch of people in the

[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.420]
media who are salivating it this poor love to bring this president down

[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.840]
absolutely unbelievable this is what happens when you refuse to grow up when

[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.200]
you're so uptight about sex and the human body and things that people and

[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.400]
that's like everybody is said like anybody with a brain is said that's between him

[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:48.400]
and will willery shock warry that's between them somebody's god damn business

[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.080]
which is what he said back on the 17th but if he would have made this speech

[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.400]
that he made this morning back then we could be talking now about the important

[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.560]
things like Sean Burke's things okay and the panthers are gonna suck this you

[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.820]
we can be talking about important stuff like that speaking of prang I said here

[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.920]
yesterday I said please please don't sign Sean Burke for the panthers guys he

[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.220]
blows he's another city like a mirror image of the other geek that we got

[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.280]
Kirk McClain captain jerk so what are they announced today oh they're working on

[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.000]
any minute we're gonna be here and they're assigning Sean Burke you're gonna

[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.980]
have two steps in minutes this year but boy you're gonna love that new arena we

[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:30.040]
could be talking about stuff like that so our entire lives are overwhelmed are

[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:35.780]
shrouded now with his horse track like a shroud of touchdown Jesus just hanging

[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:40.420]
over our heads oh it's big enough a TV show by the way I mean I got so much

[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.900]
stuff that I wanted to talk about here today but of course we got this

[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.680]
kind of starcraft getting in my way I want to do about a two-hour attack on Rob

[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:52.060]
Kaplan here today and deservedly so who's butchering that TV show you know why

[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.760]
we can't get in and maybe people say well you're just covered up for the

[00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:00.420]
practice it's just a it's just a concept that'll never work maybe that's true I've

[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.540]
enjoyed some of those shows on there to be honest with him many times if it's

[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.480]
edited right and done and a little bit of work goes in a little bit of thought

[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:12.020]
to what we got a four-hour show here every day each one of those half-hours

[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.620]
first of all splitting it up into half-hours is idiotic to begin with I mean

[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.880]
it's like a death wish putting a stupid sports show there in between but

[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:25.720]
that stupid guy bouncing around on the couch Mr. Happy face but to take and put

[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.420]
this stuff if somebody should be impeached it should be Rob Kaplan because I

[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.740]
watched last night from a quarter to 10 to 10 o'clock with this man put on the

[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.900]
year you know we get I don't have to tell you the phones lately are slowly

[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.840]
here that all the shows this town goes in cycles it's always been that way

[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.820]
always will be that way don't ask me why so I'll sit here and I'll milk some of

[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.660]
these guys let him go on for a lot longer than usual because I got a four-hour

[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:51.620]
show to kill every day with Jane Eazy as you may think but to take like the guy

[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.460]
I hate to pick that guy out because he was talking about stuff that I was

[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.740]
talking about we're trying to be responsible about Australia he's been there and

[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:02.200]
about Vancouver in the hotel and you can see I'm almost going into a coma

[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.680]
and I'm going I'm on I'm puffing on my stoke and they put this on when he

[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.620]
last night if I would have had a shotgun I would have shot the damn screen on

[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.500]
on my goddamn Sony XBR that's how forming it to mouth that's how pissed off I was

[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:19.000]
Rob Kaplan we got all this great stuff that Bulk of Brian and satellite

[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.160]
comedy that we're called is great the humorous stuff people want to go to

[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:38.340]

psychic you already saw this on see them when they were reading these were

[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.320]
but from the president's attorneys that's part of what they're saying they

[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.060]
laid out the thing about how the the definition in the Paul Jones case was a

[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:52.200]
total entrapment because that was at the time that they put a little trip to

[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.840]
wire tap moniker and a whole thing so that's one of the charges that they're

[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.700]
making was an illegal entrapment to lure him into you know this fact you know

[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.360]
I think the American author keep an eye on who is gonna be our next president

[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.740]
instead of worrying about this guy who's almost gonna be out of office anyway yeah

Mr Psych hike was in institute uh you know was in fancy of making ball and Ball and

[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:22.200]
And he had the misfortune. He had the involvement of getting involved with a bitch like this.

[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:27.520]
I agree with anything, but anyway, I hope he can survive it, I guess.

[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:27.860]
Okay.

[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:28.720]
And I think about it.

[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.700]
That's good of a lady mobile in Miami. Hello.

[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:33.960]
Hello, Neil.

[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:34.700]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.360]
This is Bobby Hainan. How are you?

[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.040]
Okay.

[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:37.960]
You remember me?

[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.720]
Bobby Hainan from the singles day.

[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.060]
Yes.

[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.000]
I've been wanting for all the day all the time.

[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:43.400]
Right?

[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.520]
I said,

[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.920]
Oh, I agree.

[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.480]
Anyway, first of all, I want to say I've been watching you on television.

[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.100]
Uh-huh.

[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:50.920]
And it was so funny.

[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.180]
One of your listeners did that.

[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.500]
He's one of my good friends.

[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.360]
Said, you know, he's telling me how great you are after the bitching out of nowhere.

[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.240]
The amuletist didn't even notice that you're having a young person.

[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:00.700]
Uh-huh.

[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.520]
Anyway, I'm following you because you're having a hard time first.

[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.880]
I worry you're almost there because it looks really big in the corner.

[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.220]
What is it?

[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:11.440]
You know, the first person that has ever said anything that makes sense about this monocle.

[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:11.700]
Uh-huh.

[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.660]
But, you know, I have an answer to this technology and I want to tell you.

[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.300]
So I first heard about this girl and about the background.

[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.500]
I had it all figured out.

[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:19.720]
Yeah.

[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:24.580]
But I tell you, I think a mother, you know, one of them had to get her immunity.

[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.700]
I mean, the mother keeps that stress and the positive in the back.

[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:29.120]
Very long.

[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.740]
The sickest, one of the sickest things in the history of an immigration effort.

[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.440]
Some of the media, the twisted people in the media, don't seem to have any problem with that.

[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.780]
They, they, nobody's questioning why anybody would do it.

[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.740]
And with the God, the reason I called it, it wasn't easy.

[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.560]
I'm in front of Mount Sinai trying to go up to see my mother,

[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:51.900]
driving around and around, wanting to call you because I feel so powerless about what's going on.

[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:56.720]
You know, you feel like you want to do something, have people say something, you know?

[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.640]
It's like a star, out of the way.

[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.720]
You know, I don't know if anybody has ever mentioned it.

[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:05.920]
I wrote it on email to a couple of programs.

[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.600]
Nobody has ever mentioned the house thought.

[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.400]
I always had that.

[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.240]
It's too small.

[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.060]
Oh, yeah.

[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.120]
It's cool.

[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.900]
Is that what it is?

[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.820]
Yeah, but they think that's a depression.

[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:21.560]
It's like a logical expression for people who are ready to even kill you.

[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:21.960]
Yeah.

[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.880]
Or slice off at the next.

[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.240]
Yeah, I'm always wonder that every time you see him, he's coming out of some garage somewhere, parking garage.

[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.460]
He's got that stupid copy from his in his aunt.

[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:36.840]
And when you think that if somebody was really impartial and doing this investigation,

[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:43.360]
does he come out with a very solemn look on their face like, he looks like he's traveling in it.

[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.260]
He's traveling from it.

[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.220]
I got a one, Bobby.

[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.080]
He's good here from it.

[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:46.920]
That's the answer, man.

[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:47.340]
Okay.

[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.020]
Bye-bye.

[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.260]
Okay, we got Hank Gover from Daniel Hyer from, from, from Plymouth, your dog track.

[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:52.980]
Okay, same difference.

[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.680]
From Plymouth, your dog track coming up next.

[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.840]
And then we got to, what do we got at six?

[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.440]
We got probably Donnie B. Talkin' baseball.

[00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.900]
We got somebody talking baseball at six.

[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.620]
Somebody who doesn't make a lot of money.

[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.120]
And then we got the pregame at six thirty.

[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.180]
The Marlin's vote for lost number 100.

[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.440]
Get the braves tonight.

[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.920]
And we got the dolphins on radio, but also on TV, Danit, on Sunday.

[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.740]
So it's two o'clock in the morning.

[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:13.460]
Go for it, that'll be fun.
