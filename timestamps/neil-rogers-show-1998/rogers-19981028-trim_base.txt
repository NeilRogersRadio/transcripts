[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820]
and beat that gator me

[00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.100]
w-u-a-l

[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.900]
where the fag is

[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.600]
and beat that gator me

[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.780]
10-03-560 WQM happy when they do you?

[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.860]
what is this obsession in this town with college sports

[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.860]
and not only college sports but college

[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.700]
how far would you say it is about 300 miles

[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.380]
to Gainesville I've never been there

[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.020]
more 300 miles

[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.180]
it's about 400 miles to Jacksonville

[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.400]
it can't be uh... okay like 300 miles away

[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.700]
the stuff that's going on here does anybody care about that

[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.620]
no but Gainesville men are obsessed with Gainesville

[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.300]
maybe we need to give an education here today

[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.980]
maybe we need to talk to some people

[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.760]
a lot about the gators

[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.320]
I saw a license tag i'm going to get my mail last night

[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.260]
I had my post office box

[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.000]
and there's a guy in front of me

[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.940]
who's got a uh... one of those specialized license tags

[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.580]
with a picture of a gator on it

[00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.980]
and it says no

[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.360]
no picture of a seminal of things

[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.320]
and said no gators with the thing

[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.220]
no g a to r no gators

[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.640]
don't you want to stick your finger

[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.700]
kind of like in your nose

[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.300]
I mean because every time I see

[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.140]
either Steve's for your obby vowed

[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.600]
I mean forget about Terry vowed

[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.940]
you know something he saw a picture of himself on TV

[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.660]
with a white shirt in the baseball camp

[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.220]
and he said i'm so damn embarrassed

[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.360]
I gotta get out of here and he just ran off and quit

[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.200]
he called a handsome quit

[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.300]
but what is it about

[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.780]
college sports in this time

[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.120]
I mean I thought this was like a sports station

[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.260]
because I see a piece of mail

[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.440]
I Greg read got this morning

[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.120]
which thank god he shared with me

[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.800]
because we like to know when the end is near

[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.800]
and it says

[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.880]
get rid of me or Rogers

[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.380]
we want sports

[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.060]
on the side of course

[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.120]
no sign you know it right there nothing

[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.780]
get rid of me or Rogers we want sports

[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.520]
even though his ratings are like uh... double anybody else on the station

[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.740]
you realize that or do we get a response on that

[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.420]
were the uh... tend to two numbers are yet no

[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.880]
well why not let's get rid of their okay

[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.620]
it's Wednesday already to book him out on Friday

[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.340]
let's get those ten to two numbers

[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.180]
so we have our own your numbers these four hours

[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.520]
and we can sit here and brag about them how great they are

[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.600]
what kind of morning drive

[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.780]
and afternoon drive put together in some demographics

[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.080]
and they bring it in more money

[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.660]
making more money than any other day part

[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.620]
but let's get rid of you because he don't want to talk sports

[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.360]
and he is frankly don't want to talk about that

[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.580]
nose picking gator craft

[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.160]
and seminal craft

[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.340]
and we're going to send the big black guy

[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.140]
we're going to send him out wide and he's going to run like a mother scratch

[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.420]
and we're going to fill him the ball

[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.160]
and we're going to score score score and

[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.420]
i mean get serious with your please

[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.100]
so i notice and of course when i do talk sports

[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.820]
there's no response anyway because i talk about a real sport like hockey

[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.340]
which we got to game with the red wings tonight

[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.860]
and we got a thousand unsolved tickets for that including the five hundred

[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.280]
panther facts so please

[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.580]
let's fill that joint up i heard gord murphy on with the worst thing this morning

[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.400]
i was going gordy good guy very articulate

[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.240]
actually said something but apart they had basically no calls

[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.440]
there was some shorts that were called in about some dolphin injury

[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.720]
and i prayed you're a sin but somebody else i never heard of

[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.980]
and that was it

[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.580]
so much foe

[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.420]
but there wasn't any discussion about the situation with the Whitney

[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.800]
which he may now play on a second line

[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.020]
we understand that he does you know who to thank for that

[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.340]
you know i understand that Terry Murray was having big gigantic

[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.900]
movements yesterday during the course of this show

[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.760]
see this ain't one of those places where you can run and hide

[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.980]
because i'm going to expose all the crap you guys are doing

[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.660]
even if we get no response to it

[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.600]
like i said they had no calls about that this morning

[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.820]
and they were going on an on a great length about the venting of Whitney and Spayla

[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.560]
and about Terry Murray being a hard ass

[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.820]
and they had gord murphy on there

[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.160]
did they have one call about that?

[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.040]
no, no, but we had all depots got to do is get out that

[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.640]
get out gelledies goat which i think is the one that Terry and Brian Murray were photographed

[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.760]
we won't get that goat out

[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.300]
and start with that gator stuff

[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.240]
and here here they come one after another after another with one finger in their

[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.640]
nostril one in their echo and start with that gator crap

[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.740]
and here we are in Miami

[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.660]
you know what's interesting the one call i did here was the guy who sat up there on

[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.860]
Gainesville radio they don't talk about the hercones they talk about the gators

[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.660]
they talk about what they're doing up there

[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.680]
which they're not in the same conference you know what what's the big deal

[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.440]
what's the attraction

[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.800]
but because we have so many people down here who had the misfortune to go into school

[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.840]
up there see i went to a school where we have a crappy football team

[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.900]
Michigan State we had a couple of good years you know 67 a couple of good

[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.980]
years along the way over the years but you know something does anybody really care all that much

[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.820]
no there's plenty of corruption and plenty of scandal and plenty of

[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.720]
illiterate the jocks up there but there's anybody really care

[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.560]
no went to Michigan State whether the team loses or not we got a great hockey team

[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.940]
but do we care about the fact that our football team sucks

[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.840]
no and at Michigan a year in and year out like this year almost every year beats just not

[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.940]
out of us we beat Notre Dame this year there you go that's our claim the family

[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.900]
don't need to do anything else but these people that go to school at some college and

[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.940]
right away to become obsessed with the football team

[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.080]
obsessed like it to be placed on a substitute for a life i don't get it i don't

[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.040]
understand it that sports talk in his town not professional sports

[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.920]
college sports i'm going to tell you something maybe we can actually work it

[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.900]
down to a meaningful level we can start talking high school sports how about junior

[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.480]
high sports how about kindergarten sports oh right there's a kid over there plays a

[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.660]
Miami high about seven years old baby he's gonna be he's growing he's about six two

[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.140]
already six years old six two hung like a moose

[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.200]
and we're gonna send him out there he's gonna go out wide and he's gonna run like a

[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.980]
mother he's gonna run at God damn Christ and they're gonna have to give that thing

[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.320]
up there they're gonna do a hill marry it's unbelievable and don't you think it's

[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.280]
a human-related it's amazing to me the grown people that adults are so

[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.600]
obsessed and so and just so full of like psychosis about this like it's important

[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.240]
like the future of the world depends on leader football or seminal football or her

[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.740]
crew and football depending on who got the biggest you know

[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.100]
shows this year stuff like that

[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.860]
isn't that what it really is all about who's got the biggest pose

[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.240]
because i'm gonna tell you Steve Spurrier and Bobby Bob you put the two of them together

[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.940]
and you still have minus points in the IQ column yeah who every time I see those guys

[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.560]
yeah who that's what comes to mind I think of the things that are wrong with the state

[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.320]
of Florida not the things that are nice about it like the weather most of the

[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.200]
time like those nice pretty palm trees stuff like that but I think of the things

[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.280]
that are wrong when I see those guys like kind of like yeah I got my finger all

[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.180]
the way up to where my brain used to be in fact maybe that's what happened maybe

[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.760]
they had their finger up there so much where the brain used to be to kind of like

[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.220]
scratched it out when it doubted kind of fell out you know what I'm talking about I

[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.140]
think you do nine minutes where you

[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.400]
and that gave your me that gave me a

[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.660]
Georgia said some hysterical lunatic on the phone which I wish we could have gotten

[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.940]
them on the fact that I discuss sports there for our main hypocrite I don't

[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.140]
discuss sports I talk about hockey which is a level above all the other sports

[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.380]
in a class by itself how about that game last night even though it was a

[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.220]
scoreless talk hey not college football which is for overgrown children I

[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.940]
mean how why do we talk about college soccer how about a cross cover a big

[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.500]
in colleges up there in an Ivy League they play La Crosse how about college

[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.220]
golf huh college swimming college diving that's what Greg

[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.240]
Lucenas always said divers do it deeper that's what he said now look what happened

[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.120]
to him I mean let's you know get into the nitty-gritty that's the problem with

[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.220]
this town you don't hear it like during the Amarland thing this year I

[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.080]
mentioned this yesterday is there any intelligent discussion about baseball

[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.160]
hey Eddie you think Leibon's gonna win 20 games this year that's a lot of

[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.220]
conversation you got about baseball in this town this might be out to

[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.200]
think if we had real sports fan in this in this town and people be screaming

[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.660]
about this they'd be having a nervous breakdown and by the way the

[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.180]
Metz only paid $30 million more for the whole deal in the next highest offer smart

[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:52.460]
move their meds but do we have any comment about that no they talk about

[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.480]
college sports that's not in any one what they do talk is kaka nonsense my

[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.040]
school better than yours is and before you go to school you're some kind of a

[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:07.340]
seminal oh my god you some kind of a hercune that's not sports that's kaka

[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:14.020]
that's baby crap that's like that so the the notion that on the evil one on

[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.700]
here there must be a reason that all these people are tuned in like the guy to

[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.480]
was screaming at you that claims he's going back to change his radio right now

[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.300]
who listens every single god damn day and his listening as I speak right now but

[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.500]
doesn't have the cahons to call and speak to me it wants to be rate you because

[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:32.340]
you said you're a macho man he's probably god damn gator if you asked me and

[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.600]
you know something the gators the seminal's anarchy or canes they can all kiss my

[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.580]
big fat back to that a give a crap about any of them except I do like to see the

[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.780]
hercunes lose I do like that I'll confess to that I was very very sad when

[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.580]
Dave Lamont was shrieking and yelling and screaming at the end of that

[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.540]
west Virginia game on Saturday that the field goal was wide right or wide

[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.260]
left or wide something because I couldn't understand what he was saying could do a

[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.340]
scream and so god damn love is if it was about something very important which it

[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:01.520]
wasn't but nevertheless I do enjoy seeing them lose because number one of the

[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.800]
corruption of the program and number two because of the full it's a fantom thing

[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.800]
in this town they couldn't even sell out the fs you game with 60% or 80% of the

[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.620]
people where there was seminal thing they couldn't even sell out that game could

[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.720]
they know that's right but if they should have like one of their glory years

[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.660]
again all of a sudden end of a pack of 80,000 phony of front row this town is great

[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.740]
for that front running phony's very big on that so I'll talk about whatever the

[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.520]
hell I want to talk about thank you in a response will be just the same none

[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.800]
nil just like I heard this morning see I feel much better about it now there's

[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:37.360]
only one person on the station that gets phone call that's Hank if you notice that

[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.620]
hang no sir if they hang can sit down into a three or four minutes or five

[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.680]
minutes or whatever and ramble on and there you go here's a Tom and baby one after

[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.760]
another after another now most of them are of course compulsive gamblers but never

[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.540]
less I salute Hank the fact that his phones bring off the warning show do they get

[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:57.060]
calls no do we get calls in no get it I got a bus I got a pop a bone to get these

[00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.440]
actions off their rest they're out there just like that guy that's calling you

[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.520]
screaming and how I but they're intimidated see I'm supposed to be the

[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.580]
limperasted fact they're supposed to be the macho men and of course they're hiding

[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.960]
behind behind the anonymity of the telephone which is I mean even less

[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.060]
excuse for them not having the McCones to talk to me but they just can't do it can

[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.040]
they do it no I want to hear right now from some people

[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.460]
tell me about gamesville well what do you give me a look like that for I've never

[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.420]
been to games though I would like to fight out something about what kind of a

[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.600]
thing is it is it kind of like Lakeland I've driven to Lakeland that's a horrible

[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.360]
place I've never driven to Lakeland but it's not like Lake City I've driven

[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.520]
to is it like that where they have a horse country a lot of horses asses run

[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.400]
in the well you know it's a college town lot of young people run around a lot of

[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.380]
bricks a lot of I.V. on the walls I.V. you can go float the itch it up I.V. on the

[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.160]
walls they make it sound like kind of like Harvard now something like that like I

[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.220]
believe it's just like dark maybe about a word or a print can or a card or whatever I.V.

[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:57.140]
school kind of like brown no oh I wouldn't know I can use the higher learning I mean

[00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.760]
does anybody learn anything and before we get anything else here this morning

[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:06.120]
because I'm fascinated with the obsession with this gator thing here I mean I

[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.780]
know that there are people the the animal huggers who are in the gators very

[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.300]
anybody ever seen any gator droppings because I thought I heard of you this

[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:18.120]
morning during of course the life that power that show gator droppings here's Miami

[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:28.020]
hello hello hello in yes sir hey I moved on here a few months ago from Houston yes

[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.880]
moved on here during the time when the baseball team was selling out all their

[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.840]
their star players yeah and I remember you were you were random raven about that

[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.740]
you were giving away your tickets and different things and you trying to

[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:48.080]
influence and nobody cared right but I remember that you were saying that you

[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.320]
were trying to send a message or we should send a message no care who the owner is

[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.760]
hockey to me is more important than Wayne Heisen and go or any one person I don't

[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.620]
give a crap or ones a team in addition to which he claims he's going to be selling

[00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.680]
the team I hope it does real soon I don't care about that then worrying about who

[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.320]
the goddamn owner is but let's face it I mean as bad as the team is it's not like

[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.060]
the hockey team like had a whole bunch of superstars in the face with the Marlin

[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.300]
thing okay he went out and he bought a championship team spent a lot of money

[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.480]
for it and then he said well we got to have a new stadium you know we're not

[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.360]
going to be able to keep the Marlin here and then you know he gave everybody

[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.580]
away and they still didn't care they lost a hundred eight games and nobody

[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:27.680]
still cared about it well I any gamesville people online anybody online

[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.260]

to see if I want an honest answer you think that that was a difficult I mean if they're see

[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.140]

[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:14.120]
from a mobile and vocal how long ago I've been reading about 10 10 rings are

[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.480]
four I'm sitting here you know something I could be saying everywhere that the phones

[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.180]
broke it might be no it might be it is I'm calling on call about games real well

[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.580]
let's hear it how you're on clock clock the 96 graduate when there for five years

[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.660]
and tell me all about games though what is it it's your I guess it's your

[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.940]
constant college town I've been to some other college towns and I thought games

[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:42.360]
was the best one yeah you know I've been better than I've ever been up there I've

[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:51.720]
only been to a couple of schools in the south so you know I can't talk about

[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.560]
East Lansing Columbus and places like that my brothers they go to Columbus about a

[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.620]
month ago though for a football game and he said he really had a great time

[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.140]
he said that you know of course the people in a high or very nice and that

[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:08.660]
Columbus was a great college town yeah it was a little bit comparable to games

[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.780]
or except that it was just a much bigger city and of course you've got the

[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.600]
different weather and the different I mean other because I people say well

[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.480]
of course they still out of the game in the football game because there's nothing

[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.520]
else to do there yeah I hear that all the time they you know that they do say that

[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.240]
that's true but you have to remember that about half the people that that go to those

[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.960]
games come from all around they drive up from here you know some camp up from

[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:39.240]
Jacksonville so I mean what's the what's the what's the university of Florida what's

[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.160]
the student population right now it's right around 40,000 40,000 and they do

[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:51.040]
70,000 and some for the games right 85 85 and saw every game of course that's

[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.260]
right every game filled out even if we're playing a best in dumb you or for playing

[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.980]
for to see it doesn't matter or you're calling her coons name's deaf and dumb you know

[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:04.220]
no no no no I'm talking about like the most little cream pasta we played open

[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.140]
to see right well everybody's going to do that you know and I get you know and again

[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.800]
the reason why we do that is because you know our family only problem is up in East

[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.740]
Lansing we try that too but every now and then they beat us so it didn't work out

[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.300]
for you know my central Michigan Eastern University of Detroit.

[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.800]
I believe I believe that hasn't happened to us recently so hopefully you won't

[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.140]
happen in the near future. Okay pal go gators all right see ya.

[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.840]
Now this was the most revealing thing that has ever happened to me in my life I've

[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:34.320]
been broadcasting for 600 years and I'm sitting here and I'm getting every day I'm

[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.680]
getting sabotaged over here I'm getting a job you saw it you're always like I said

[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.200]
I hate this system getting her the get her people's thoughts phone system I'm

[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.720]
going to tell you I'd like to break the guy's damn thing now I'm going to do a

[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.800]
hand go over right here on here and lose it I'm going to do a hand right here

[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.760]
and just totally lose it because I've been sitting here for a

[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:57.040]
10 months with a phone system that doesn't have to work I'm sitting here

[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.580]
saying to myself even for a crank to be calling it I mean I know if we got

[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.440]
anybody listening something must be going on I reach over here and I start

[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.920]
pressing all the goddamn buttons now let me ask you this what happened after I

[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.520]
did that that suddenly magically allows of calls just start coming through

[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:17.300]
George what happened I just picked him up it's still broken so in other

[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:22.340]
words they don't ring they don't ring there doesn't show up on here no I

[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.480]
could go and reset the system to see if that helps and it probably will

[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.460]
but I'm going to tell you something this guy upstairs wants to be a big

[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.700]
shot like I've told you before Mr. wannabe we could get a goddamn

[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:37.400]
erector set we could get our own little goddamn teeny tiny transmitter and

[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.960]
put it out here on 441 at least the people on 441 can hear the guy damn

[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.300]
Satan their cars which they can't now I could build a better

[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.900]
goddamn studio with a guy with an erector set with a play toy then this man is

[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.060]
putting her for us 10 months sitting here with a guy then and you remember in the

[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:57.160]
beginning when the phones wouldn't drop off we've had more f in technical

[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.700]
goddamn problems and still got those big numbers how do you like that for all

[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.220]
you sports nerds that can't stand the show who are all listening right now I'm

[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.400]
going to reset it during the break everyone we are to reset the whole goddamn radio

[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:13.960]
stations what we ought to do 27 after 10 to 8 out of the station stands for nothing

[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.460]
you and a talk show without a phone that works how do you like that we're kind of

[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:21.640]
used to it though aren't we at this point yeah so in other words there were all

[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.540]
these people calling every guy damn line had somebody out there the random but

[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.220]
they they were ringing because the little green light don't come on in here

[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.280]
like I'm lying to here so you know now the dial is in but when a ring it

[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.680]
doesn't the light up is what you're saying to me that's right okay so we'll do the

[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.700]
best we can as usual here on slip shot radio here's a mobile in Miami hello

[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:45.360]
Neil yes sir yeah I'm a Florida graduate I got a little stuff to steal on

[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.680]
that city a lot of people are calling up trying to make this a glorified town

[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.340]
about Danesville and University Florida let's face it the nickname for that

[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.640]
town is hot town that's that's what is known by the local

[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:01.100]
local town yeah and number two the only thing that's ever been beneficial out

[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.500]
of the University of Florida is it's marijuana growing that's one of the best

[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.620]
Sweden America we're talking the drug culture is phenomenal and I don't know if you

[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.380]
get up there for four years is that got stoned got laid in a with the class

[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.740]
one like I said just like Ann Arbor it sounds like to me with the great town I'll

[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.620]
never forget it I lost a few brains that was worth every hour but what's the

[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.020]
obsession down here I mean this gator thing is it's bigger than the dolphins it's

[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.020]
bigger than all the other sports and it's how put together it's like a like a

[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.440]
mental sickness down here well seriously if you go up there you have to spend

[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.760]
any time in games though it's like being under jail how the rest is nothing to do

[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.520]
it's the most boring town in the world that's where everybody goes to the

[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.340]
football games if you're not getting high you're going to put ball games you're

[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.420]
getting ways that's right about 85,000 people telling out there

[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.880]
beginning when they're playing the bump for you it doesn't mean nothing it means

[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.940]
nothing those people often games so they travel in like the last color set they

[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.860]
travel from all over the state of Florida it's the biggest boosters in the

[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.620]
Florida from games we have the biggest booster clubs but there's nothing going

is it again 305 what well in vocal hello Neil yes sir I'm something wrong with

[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:55.420]
phone yeah I know no no what happened before was when I was trying to reach to do

[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:59.900]
we've been busy with all of a sudden when you went to ballast it there then all of a sudden

[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:06.580]
all started on through so it was crazy yeah I've been feeling for last three or four months

[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.560]
here somebody's dealing with his phone system I mean I can't prove it but I have a very strong

[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:16.000]
belief because I've been doing this two goddamn long somebody's did them with us a couple of things

[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.300]
last Friday night I'd say they're the game we got the worst ever yes Friday was one of the

[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:26.260]
all-time worst not the worst but it was in it certainly in the worth five one of the work

[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:33.260]
the five performances I mean no enthusiasm it was disgraceful absolutely disgraceful nothing

[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.860]
and so then he goes and benches the two best players are writing that and say see this is a guy

[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.500]
when he came here Terry Murray I don't want to get started again but I will he said well

[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.580]
these guys better perform because if they don't they'll be sitting on the bench and in the meantime

[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.380]
the guys that don't perform like Kirk Mueller and Needah Mare they're in a lineup every God

[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:53.220]
damn night and you know he wants he wants to take it on the guys who are best players which makes

[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:58.160]
no sense at all to anybody how about the world and it really pissed me off to watch remember when

[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.100]
he dropped the gloves the guy wouldn't engage with the best year well who's the guy in number eight

[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:08.840]
for sure for sure yeah I mean it's right was Murray telling him to go out and get something going

[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.920]
just you know just trying to cite the team because I don't know but by the time he got into that

[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.800]
fight it was already for nothing the game was all I ever so was totally meaningless no that see

[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.780]
they're not going to get stuck into his stupid guncraft yeah I know that that number one he really

[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:25.300]
can't fight number two we can't play and other than that how the why is he out there so much you know

[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.560]
the junior when you got a team that can't score why do you put iron hands or well out there all the time

[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:34.800]
I disagree with you a little less I really thought I saw some started to some skills in this guy

[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.720]
you know can't play I mean I thought he's got he's got a little better night exhibition game but

[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:43.040]
as far as being a real player forget it he's not where it was really disgraceful watch them I mean

[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.020]
the stick handling properly is absolutely disgrace right and all he did every time he took a lot of

[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:52.540]
cheap shots but that time I was so damn frustrated you know it was born up and which is when I left

[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.980]
but just to watch you mouth to try and engage somebody it was it was really a disgraceful

[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.220]
and by the way speaking of Donald Bush here who used to play for the Canadians he's been

[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:05.540]
around league speaking of right for sure from that cover even though he is their goon but nevertheless

[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.320]
he can play he has a little I've seen him make some pretty damn good plays he's a real player as

[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.920]
opposed to just a goon who can't do anything out there and who keeps getting stuck out there

[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.680]
over and over again this guy is like the Reggie Fleming back in the in the 60s with the Ranger

[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.820]
man when all he had to do was fight when he was fighting fight of L.A. John Ferguson yeah

[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:28.180]
I'm from Montreal you know he would kick the crap out of but Ferguson could skate yeah for you know

[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.140]
Ferguson was a great well here and we're all get away with it because like everything else that's

[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.580]
going on here nobody gives a crap nobody says anything except me and that's why I'm going to keep

[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:40.080]
him nice all right I got a question for you real quick yeah real quick there's a topic in the

[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:47.040]
Palm Beach post today and AIDS and transmitter from oral sex seriously yes see they're saying

[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.820]
can they're saying you can and not right right that I don't agree with that that's not what I've read

[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.180]
all right good luck okay and back to you okay we have two open lines in day one and

[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:03.440]
brown or if they're ringing we have no idea but let's uh okay I'm just checking because we

[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.420]
don't have a phone system that works today and we got nobody running to join today so we won't

[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:11.220]
get those numbers that we're looking for we won't get any assistance here because we're on automatic

[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:20.000]
pilot which means probably a lot of music coming up 1041 at 5cl it's day with Miami to

[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:36.120]
go yeah I think we lost it okay we have an open line in brown or two and data four systems all

[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.960]
screwed up here I'm not going to worry about the phone okay you would do whatever you want

[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.740]
with those assholes okay she waited all that time we finally got her on she was under virgin

[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.160]
like getting into a bad spell like oh Jay or whatever and then all of a sudden she popped right

[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:54.260]
out that was the end of her anyway John Grogan has a very interesting art the DNA thing it's

[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:58.920]
a organization it doesn't catch anything to join we got bumper stickers we got placards we got

[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:04.440]
the all kinds of stuff buttons but we don't have to be organized because it's just common sense

[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:11.780]
do no harm DNA but that's an interesting thing there and never it brings back to mind a situation

[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:16.180]
happened with me years ago and I think we broke the attendance record for the miracle at anywhere

[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:20.580]
so I'm signing autographs I'm doing a whole thing and then I walk in to see part of the game you know

[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.260]
I walk around into the stadium and there's an old part sitting up there with some other people

[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.660]
and I look up and I hear I hear him say I mean one of those people is talking about you but make

[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.840]
sure it's loud enough so that you can hear it or maybe his hearing aid wasn't working that day

[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:38.920]
is an atheist yeah the guy says oh there's Neil the guy said yeah but he's an atheist and he gave

[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:46.160]
him a look like oh jeez he's an atheist I mean I could have expected if he said oh he's

[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.220]
a fag you know something like that but this far transcended any of that stuff

[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:56.860]
and and that was the first time it ever done to me that there's this enormous stigma of not being

[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:01.840]
one of the god people even if you're a god person that's not good enough you have to be one of the

[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:11.260]
the god people so god bless you Frank Giovoni whoever the hell you are 80 years old he's from

[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.900]
religious intolerant lunatics like the ones who killed the doctor in Buffalo the other day

[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.220]
oh yeah we believe we're pro life we don't believe in your life but we're pro life for those

[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:28.160]
fetuses and we say that's the end of the story town but it's actually not a bad little town

[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.840]
and as far as I'm familiar to what it's compared to the palahasi well yeah I mean what could

[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:40.620]
be worse than palahasi it's you know there's nothing that's gonna be compared to Miami

[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:45.440]
you know it's first verse in all that but it's not a bad town it's more it's for veracity

[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.660]
it's for it's for veracity um tonight's game you gotta be excited

[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:55.740]
why not stop those guys while I'm team last year okay date county lines are open to make eggs

[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.660]
right here on the thing I remember he could I could try eggs right in the county we got a

[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.400]
phone system that doesn't work last night on a TV show which is the last time I'm ever gonna

[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.700]
even mention it until it goes off next week the the beginning they got the sound finally

[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.400]
straightened out no hum and then as the show went on the sound kept getting lower and lower

[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.560]
in the hum came back we you know we went they wanted to disappoint why don't make sure you get

[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:20.620]
your free hum job on way I'm either so we got a half s tv deal over there which they can't

[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.780]
technically get that thing straightened out I got a situation here where we got a telephone

[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:29.140]
system that has been crap since the day we sat down here and now we just totally fallen apart

[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:33.180]
I'm gonna reset the whole thing during this break and when what's that gonna do uh maybe nothing

[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:38.280]
maybe something who knows don't you think it'd be a lot better if I just sat here and read all my

[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.200]
great articles and yeah that would be a lot of stuff but never thought I worried about the god damn

[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.300]
phone I'm just wondering haven't I been telling you that we've been getting dicked on this phone

[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:51.080]
from for weeks now yes I've been doing this too long I'm sorry but you saw that right there when

[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.700]
we sat down and then all of a sudden as soon as I started talking about it and touching the buttons

[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.720]
up magically and miraculously all these people run the line

[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.520]
I mean I'm not that paranoid that I would see her make it up because I know there's plenty of

[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.820]
times in this town that you could say every word that's ever been invented four letter and five

[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:15.080]
letter and two letter is an FU and nobody would call but this is just two goddamn obvious

[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.680]
and is there anybody I hear in charge no anybody involved in any of this stuff

[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.980]
no straightened out for us no of course not they're all of this one's on vacation again and this

[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:28.920]
one is out to launch and this one's out of the building and who the hell knows who's in charge

of statutes of limitation he was fatally flawed because million confessed to police they'd

[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:05.820]
be fondled the girl oh father that's good there we go again so Lisa's time was with girls very

[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.800]
ago that's a breath of fresh air a little bit of a change got to check out see if you're a

[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:15.260]
hergion sweet art yeah let me just stick my probe in there and see what we find just probing for

[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:21.240]
the truth here's pompato beach you know who this is go leaves go yeah just one of the common on a

[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:26.280]
couple of things first of all I go to games the other year not for a football game and I'll get

[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:32.140]
back to that in a minute yeah those are beautiful town really low rowing hills it's got a lot of

[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:37.560]
Victorian homes that are just you know some of them he transcends all of this other crap as far

[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.860]
as I'm concerned okay when I first came down here 22 years ago I used to go out on my balcony

[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:47.420]
and Tony and Dan tell you I'm K. M. O. W. Lewis I could hear a hockey game and channel two with

[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:51.400]
televising game when they were fundraising and they did more fundraising that they did televising

[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:58.080]
on the game now here's a bombshell the number one event in the city of games will every year

[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:04.940]
is not a football game it's the Gator National Drag Race is held in March it brings in more money

[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:11.900]
oh my god all the Gator football games combined they're driving in March in Genesville every year

[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:16.360]
in March yeah they're dragging it yep and the race and two and it like I said brings in more

[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.620]
money than all the football games combined yeah how about that so in other words it's a great place

[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:26.480]
absolutely that's compared to here but then what isn't real houses now yeah real houses not all

[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:31.600]
this concrete stock and stuff all houses actually look like houses ain't no Toronto though I'll

[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.060]
guarantee you that no it ain't no trial but it was a nice town that a good one okay and god bless

[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:41.360]
you sir and go least go okay there you go getting a few reports on games I'm gonna tell you I

[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:47.060]
said here that first 20 or 25 minutes would seem like an eternity to me and I realized we've

[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:51.100]
gone through a rough what is it about the last six months on this radio station but I mean this

[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:57.280]
was just unbelievable just incredible and it was like that skit on sc tv where the guy sit

[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.060]
near the show and he's dead they can't make the phone ring for love of money and finally after

[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:04.720]
he starts screaming and swearing and carrying on and let's kill all your children and the phone

[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:11.280]
finally rings and up wrong number and that's what I felt like here this morning because we're

[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:15.460]
being dicked here with a guy damn bunch of cheap crap that they got at the will work somewhere

[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:21.700]
somewhere at radio shlock and we're trying to make magic here for these people and is there

[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.720]
anybody here who like has any interest in this no when I just all conveniently happen to be out

[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:30.540]
again here today get that automatic pilot switch going because there ain't nobody here running the

[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:40.000]
ship oh yeah just the water Nazi here's a mobile informer is hello yes sir hello I'm here

[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.420]
yes really here though very briefly very briefly yesterday uh

[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:50.160]
apparently uh I'm not suggesting one of these uh Colombian hockey fans call them okay

[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.800]
have a nice day pal this guy wants to call every single day and tell me about his death see

[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.540]
I we don't play that game here sir we got just like the guy to call me yesterday he wanted to

[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:03.080]
pick up where he was the day before and repeat the same whole conversation again about the pot

[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:07.380]
and whatever we were talking about we don't play that game here sir I realized you're kind of

[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.800]
desperate over there and Fort Myers just kissed the ground that you got the show on here at least

[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:15.840]
temporarily but we're not going to have a running rep or take this is now his third attempt to call

[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:22.940]
in here and get an unload his hostility and psychosis about Colombian I hate to break the news

[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:29.620]
you sir I hope this doesn't burst your bubble I like Colombians okay I'm not too big on the

[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.520]
median cartel but anybody outside of that which I think there might be 10 people in the country you

[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:40.120]
aren't having joined yet other than that I like Colombians okay so you Yahoo's over there in

[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.340]
Fort Myers I realized that not everybody who's listening in fact most people listen to the show

[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:48.060]
don't fall in that category but if you have spilled over who think that you can use this radio show

[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:53.180]
to spew your generalized hatred and venom forget it go get your sheets out have a great time

[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:58.860]
this weekend at the rally and leave us alone over here okay and just kiss the ground that you're

[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.500]
over there in Fort Myers otherwise the Colombians would come and guide them put your ass out of

[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:09.420]
town on a rail that's right what a bunch of horse crap that is every day this guy feels like

[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:14.160]
compel the call in like he's going to have a running debate I'll tell you what old buddy why not

[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:19.820]
come on down here you give us a date you give us a date at high noon and we'll get a whole bunch of

[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:25.340]
our Colombian friends to meet you down here and we'll have a seminar at the holiday in and you can

[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:29.760]
stand there and look them right into place to face and you can tell them that they're all a bunch

[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:36.540]
of subhuman no good even scumbag or whatever to have you said and then see what the responses okay

[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.920]
and maybe you might learn something maybe you might be or not your differences oh

[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:49.100]
eight minutes after eleven at five six eight holy mackenon this is your boy on the voice of the

[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:54.860]
Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority oh god five six eight WQM here's

[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:58.620]
an interesting fact which I think may have some truth in it it says your phone lines remain in

[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.640]
trouble so I resort into the facts the interest with the Florida Geaters is nothing but they can

[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.960]
drive controversy the morning team comes up with the stimulate calls and since we have a great

[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.800]
number of overgrown children running around with their college vanners stuck to their asses those

[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.720]
are the colors they get on the line an effort I guess to impress the audience with the popularity of

[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:19.360]
the show ten question marks and it goes on to say I'm not a hockey expert by any stretch of the

[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:24.000]
imagination but what the new coach of the Panthers has done with Mr. Whitney is not only unacceptable

[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.320]
but tedious repetition of the crappy product we were given last year the more things change the more

[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.460]
they stay the same okay excellent job sir excellent observation and write on all counts

[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.240]
and again I don't want to dittle with anybody else's show but I can only speak as somebody who's

[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.400]
like a captive audience here the last twenty minutes of that show what I'm getting ready to do this

[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.740]
show if we ever get the equipment working and that is that here and all these gator people

[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:49.000]
calling in here and that guy then tape of that radio station up there over and over again is

[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:57.680]
Ponderous ad-beth now am I the only a Georgian I or we the only two people in this state in this

[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:03.600]
town who don't care about the gators we've got to be we're out of step mister you better get with it

[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:10.160]
I don't give a flying crap about the gators about the semis about the hiracune

[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:15.360]
crap about the Spartans to be honest with you I saw a little bit of their prophetic performance

[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.120]
against Minnesota Saturday what they want to blow into the game in the last minute and a half

[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:24.580]
Minnesota score is ten points and we want to blow in a game and I'm used to it did it did it change

[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.920]
my life oh it reminds me of a call I had this morning I'm coming to work and some kid calls

[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:33.920]
he's reading a prepared speech about the dolphins congratulating them on their win on Sunday and

[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.440]
about a beat by the book and then he talks about the buffalo but he's reading it he's got a written

[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:43.840]
out long hand and he talks about all the sleepless nights we've had in the past over Andre Reed and

[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:49.240]
this one and Bruce Smith and I'm thinking to myself I know it's been a great rivalry for a long

[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:54.080]
time until the bill's fortunes turn south but I mean is there anybody in this town that had

[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.720]
sleepless nights about the dolphins playing the buffalo bill no and did you ever have any sleepless

[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.860]
nights over unless maybe you're making a big bet I can understand having sleepless nights if you're

[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.220]
making you know a compulsive gambler like default or some of the other people we got on this station

[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:12.820]
but a sleepless night and this was some kid who I don't think is making any bets on a game not yet

[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:20.620]
sleepless nights over Bruce Smith and Andre Reed and Jim Kelly who's long gone and all his other

[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:31.000]
going wow and Thurmond Thomas here's a Miami hello Neil yes sir I'll go all day yes no all day

[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:36.920]
well this is morning yeah I went to games the last week and I went to school over five and a half

[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.880]
years yes sir and you have some more people calling then there's kind of missing a point behind

[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:46.960]
games okay what is the point behind games you I spent five and a half years there I still go a

[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:53.180]
couple times here it's because of the drugs in Neil yeah and that Javier Neil with nine different

[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:58.240]
any other city or town just a lot of hill building a lot of money to go there well why don't

[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.500]
these people are calling on the morning show why don't they admit that instead of talking about

[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:05.760]
Steve Sparrow Schwarzen on a theme who's gonna catch the most passes news got the biggest lineman

[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:10.540]
and all this other tedious crap why don't they talk about the good stuff maybe the way 40

[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:14.460]
Neil maybe when they discover Viagra and Jamesville man maybe these bad guys might get alive

[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:20.820]
and they have the all the best all night raid club in the country in gamesville yeah very good

[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:25.300]
news there's our first honest call of the year and it's already the end of October we have an

[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.840]
open line and Broward Dave County but because the phone is still all still up and will be what I keep

[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:33.000]
checking them nothing yeah okay well I don't want to say those are the eight lines because some of

[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.800]
that's another thing with this system some of them come in on those last three lines who knows

[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.100]
where the phones are coming in here I'm sitting here screaming and carrying on like a maniac and

[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:46.320]
the phone systems and piece of crap anyway so what's the point five six seven oh five six of

[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:52.140]
this keep you know going up and down just keep punching it and the phone lines to and see if there's

[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:56.980]
anybody button button who's got the button baby this is unbelievable I've done top shows under bizarre

[00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:01.180]
circumstances before in my life but never in my life with one where we're playing hide and seek

[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:09.420]
today with a phone just beautiful nice gone Greg here's a mobile in Margade hello hey what's up

[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:15.520]
yes sir real brief me I want to just say I agree with everything you say about religion speaking

[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:20.920]
tongues grab a hold of that wicked snake like they do on chemistry and twist it in the yanket

[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:28.440]
and the snake too five six seven oh five six the I have no idea what we got what we don't have

[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.540]
because I do know what we do have and that's a crappy phone system that's been crappy since the day

[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:37.920]
we said who makes this thing gentner whoever to help gentner is I wish you have like a bad

[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.660]
bottom movement okay I hope you wind up with a bruised god damn like I had there for a few days

[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:47.060]
not only does their phone system stuff yeah their call screening software sucks because it's

[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:51.320]
designed by someone who never produced a show yeah and when you try to talk to them about it they

[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:55.060]
don't want to hear from it yeah we tried to get some modification but I'll bet you sure what keep

[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:59.780]
compared that we use that a radio stage of question you know you can knock IOD all you want but

[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:03.800]
I'll tell you one thing okay and we had some stuff over there like those old car machines and we

[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:08.100]
had some stuff that wasn't maybe the best but generally speaking match wean over there and then

[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:14.380]
even what's his name raw a taxon who was a hard ass but nevertheless they spent just untold

[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:18.280]
amounts of money to bring in the best god in equipment the most day-to-be art stuff that money could

[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:22.300]
buy unfortunately just like over there at whammy they had a bunch of engineers who didn't know

[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:27.880]
how to make it work right with their digital stuff at the TV station but nevertheless they spared

[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:31.960]
no expense and bring us in the state of the art to try at least to give us the opportunity to

[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:39.260]
to be a real god damn radio station on a m which ain't easy baby but this joint over here and I'm

[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:43.440]
going to tell you you'll be easily people over there in naples you're a disgrace you're not broadcast

[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:49.580]
is your schlockmesters schlockmesters if this audience could have seen what we went through those last

[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:54.660]
days of December before we finally got on the year coming in here day after day after day and

[00:44:54.660 --> 00:45:00.760]
being told well this part and the stuff was coming in here piecemeal because sweet sure weren't

[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:06.400]
going to spend that money to buy new stuff were we oh no we had to get the computer over here the

[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:11.940]
DCS that plays all of this neat stuff like like that we had to get this from Philadelphia from on

[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:16.360]
so there are other above four stations up there and it came in pieces one cart in one day another

[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:20.520]
cart and of course uh for George of course I was working 24 hours today trying to put it together

[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:27.200]
with scotch tape and then of course this this beat up all of cart deck that they probably kicked out

[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.200]
of one of those maybe even the four minor stations that here we don't want this thing in a building

[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:37.860]
anymore that also came in a box like I said this was like a tinker toy studio a tinker toy radio

[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:41.880]
station we're sitting here with like a tenor eleven share in man in this market on a make

[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:47.960]
believe goddamn radio station getting postcards saying hey Greg read getting the law if we want sports

[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:52.680]
on a year twenty four hours a day how do you like that so you can go back to your two shares

[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.800]
or maybe your one shares like when Edwin Christine was on her in the midday and even when I was

[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.360]
off the air for seven months today still have a number here in midday though they did not

[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:08.140]
so just so we can satisfy some of these overgrown children and like I said you listen to the

[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:13.940]
conversation you try to talk about any sport in this town there are no people in this town who can

[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:18.060]
discuss sports intelligently maybe like one percent of the people here and then most of those are

[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:24.620]
people who are a fan of other teams because they're sure as home out from here steamy wiserman that guy

[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:29.460]
yesterday at wiser guy yesterday with steamy wiserman yeah another hockey expert

[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:35.520]
but college football now we're talking maybe because they got and we found a wide they got

[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.300]
the good weed up there in gamesville at least we finally had somebody who's treated out for us

[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:42.780]
only took us an hour twenty minutes yeah we finally got to the bottom of it

[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:49.860]
get the seeds out of it here's for Myers somehow hey Neil yes sir you tell me about

[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:56.120]
feasley they got all the money down there naples and they they remodeled seven seventy over here

[00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:01.160]
you know really yeah so that's about the time that you came on yeah so they probably

[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:05.220]

[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:35.440]
to search you no matter what and you know that's part of the obligation of flying and and I have

[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.960]
a right to take any money you have on you and tell you that you're a drug dealer and not even

[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.340]
give you a receipt they do give you a receipt that they didn't have to be co-opted if they didn't

[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.740]
give a receipt there's a reason for that wait wait what would the reason be sir

[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:51.260]
obviously because they've identified that person as a drug trafficker and he actually

[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:55.840]
gonna owe people money if they don't give them a resume sir let me do it sir you just want to

[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:59.320]
make a lot of noise or did you hear the article I read I spend you know a couple of minutes reading it

[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.440]
I do hear the thing and you know what you know sometimes I got to respect your honesty but

[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.560]
sometimes you just only cover half of uh half of the issue and what I like to do is the election

[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:12.840]
but if they did even run a speech it's obvious that they wanted him to go through and he had to

[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:19.700]
answer somebody because there was drug money sir let me say it to you again there were no drugs found

[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:24.860]
and they didn't even arrest him okay but they kept the money let me say it again they kept the

[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:29.540]
money when the officer he asked him for a receipt they handed him a receipt for an undetermined

[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:34.340]
amount of US currency not even an amount of money it took him two years to go to court and get his

[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:39.960]
money back real there were no drugs there was no arrest and there was no commission and you can

[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:45.840]
keep saying me on me on me on me 50,000 times this goes on all the time real you're an intelligent guy

[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:51.060]
for the people who's physically powerful from the $39,000 will be narcotics on them number two

[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:57.220]
you know it was impossible for one in the carrying $9,000 will be narcotics so so where was it

[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.300]
you know that doesn't mean the way they transport one where was it in our concert where was

[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.780]
in our comics you delivered it and was going to his way to pick it up oh so in other words you

[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:11.200]
so in other words you we have psychic DEA people now we know this for a fact

[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:16.660]
that if I get on a plane that I'm flying home from go you didn't hear the quick

[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:21.320]
no I didn't know because I was talking to loud thank God he hung up because he's got no balls and

[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:25.680]
he's another one of those line pieces of crap third of porkers is what he is another porker

[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.340]
anything that the law enforcement people do in this country and you know that was only one page I

[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:36.160]
read out of this book there are hundreds of pages telling about the similar stories and worse

[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.800]
oh but we just made it up you know you're a bright guy but you're only telling half of the story

[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.020]
I'm telling you the whole goddamn story sir the DEA ought to be disbanded today

[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:52.240]
they ought to disband the whole goddamn DEA because all is in the big gigantic waste of taxpayer

[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:56.980]
time and money and they use the news media oh we made this big bus today and we did yeah what

[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.240]
we do you're really doing a hell of a job

[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:06.880]
hassling the hell out of people especially minorities because we know that any minority members

[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:11.640]
got a lot of cash on him he is a drug dealer don't ask any questions don't give him a receipt

[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:16.200]
just bust his ass bust his chops hassling the hell out of him just like blacks in his

[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.920]
Spanish driving through a loo's your county which we know there's no red necks no bigots up there

[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:25.440]
just like that guy over there in Fort Myers at the Colombians are the worst uh I mean how in

[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.820]
God's name can anybody get on the air can go anywhere and make and make statements like that

[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:36.160]
the fill in the blank the the biggest scumbags the worst bunch of direct the worst you know whatever

[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:42.860]
so thank God we don't live in the deep south with a bunch of bigots four minutes till

[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:47.840]
nothing I said and was so cowardly that he just hung up and disappeared again this is from the

[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.660]
book lost rights games both are the destruction of American liberty which you all damn well

[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:42.180]
people smoking Paul with nothing yeah I'm like Jesus is over okay I'm gonna find a good time so

[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:46.540]
we have an open line of day five six seven oh five six and five six three on the mobile one line

[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:53.640]
here's point and beach hello I kneel yes sir hi how are you I'm a young Julio and uh very

[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:58.500]
interested in your topic I a couple years ago I had gone through the D.A. System people they

[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:02.400]
bust the more I can't believe your phone lines aren't lit up they are now they are after that

[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.900]
asshole call they all lit up like a helicopter jack guy that guy has no clue he's he's putting

[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:10.880]
he's playing with people's lives and he's got no proof on nothing and I mean I want I'm

[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.500]
sitting here reading him right from this book which I'm sure this guy didn't you know he researched

[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:19.040]
this book very well he didn't just make this stuff up he's got names and dates and the judges name

[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.240]
and I'm reading them and it's well you know he must have had you know he didn't have it on him he

[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:28.420]
didn't you know we as we presume that you're guilty because you've got cash there you go can you

[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:32.220]
imagine I was just saying to George Zunebrake can you imagine getting off of playing in Vegas

[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:36.800]
and having a bunch of DEA guys there with dogs sniffing dogs checking to see if you have a lot of

[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.300]
cash on you yeah well I'm sure Vegas wouldn't have anything to do with that they would put up with

[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:44.300]
that for five seconds man they'd have those DEA people be sleeping with the fishes they know

[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:49.620]
they're messing with them Vegas right but Vegas uh Neil you're wonderfully have a great show and

[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:55.280]
uh I have a different outlook of life because you give me a lot of aspirations and uh Neil's got go

[01:05:55.280 --> 01:06:00.540]
see the reason it's so great there is because it's not a police state do no harm let people live that's

[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:05.800]
all we have all these self-fulfilling prophecies here in this country the more drug enforcement

[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.780]
organizations we got the more people more drug addicts we have to have to keep them in business

[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.540]
the more things that you make illegal the more agencies you have to have the more billions of dollars

[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:22.100]
you got to spend instead of taking care of things they really need to be taken to there all these

[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:26.900]
billions of dollars were wasted on this horsecraft and we got people starving to death and freezing

[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:35.160]
to death in the wintertime on the streets of this country and we're spending billions of dollars

[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:40.140]
to fight the wicked weed because these people like we've said all this last couple of weeks

[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:45.060]
that we've been talking about this it's a big goddamn bureaucratic nightmare is what it is and they

[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:49.420]
have to keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more money because they have to justify

[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:57.380]
their existence drug-sniffing dogs baby because you might have a joint on your ass how do you like that

[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:05.360]
anybody ever joint near there it's a evidence past noon and who turns out to be a wacko and fuller

[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.520]
craft from some scumbag and we're just going to come in and seize your property we're not even

[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:14.520]
going to take the trouble look and see if it's uh for real we're just going to come in do whatever

[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:18.040]
how we want and then you can go to court and spend all your hard earned money and they're work to

[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:22.640]
get your property back maybe if you're lucky and let me say and only because the Pittsburgh

click up the phone.

[01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:18.070]
I'm driving home from lunch, four lunch at Suboka.

[01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:22.110]
I'm 45 year old businessman with a student tie on.

[01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:25.050]
Right when you're talking about the loss of rights,

[01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:28.410]
I pull right into a Broward County Sheriff's Checkpoint,

[01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.690]
with radio on.

[01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:31.190]
I put the radio off.

[01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:34.610]
I look over to my right, and there's a couple of teenagers

[01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:37.170]
with shaved heads and ponytails and Camaros

[01:15:37.170 --> 01:15:38.470]
and firebirds, et cetera.

[01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.790]
Right.

[01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:40.570]
Getting shaken down by the cops.

[01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:44.030]
I come pulling up to the checkpoint, go right on through.

[01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.710]
Right.

[01:15:45.090 --> 01:15:47.890]
I have a 45 years old in the Smokin' Pop for 25 years.

[01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:49.470]
I'm doing it right for myself,

[01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:51.730]
but the need for rules at the same time.

[01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.190]
Right.

[01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:52.730]
It's brutal.

[01:15:53.770 --> 01:15:55.790]
And you're the voice of truth, and I appreciate it.

[01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:56.270]
Okay pal.

[01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:56.910]
You're on a good job.

[01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:57.610]
Thanks a lot, thanks.

[01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:00.250]
That's right, if you're young, if you got long hair,

[01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:01.790]
if you look a little on a hip, be aside,

[01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:04.290]
if you're black, if you're Hispanic, if you're a fag,

[01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:07.210]
whatever the hell you are, the government is just waiting

[01:16:07.210 --> 01:16:09.190]
to put you over and hassle your ass,

[01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:12.630]
and we're paying big fat tax money to these assholes

[01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:15.930]
so they can protect us, so they can keep us safe.

[01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:18.270]
Who the hell's gonna keep us safe from them?

[01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:19.490]
That's a goddamn question.

[01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:25.210]
Seizing people's property, shaking people down,

[01:16:25.530 --> 01:16:26.750]
shaking down minorities.

[01:16:29.010 --> 01:16:31.190]
Oh yeah, illegal road checks out there in Iowa.

[01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:34.090]
Who wants to give them the right to do these road checks?

[01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:35.050]
What is that all about?

[01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:36.130]
It's like something you're expecting to see

[01:16:36.130 --> 01:16:39.350]
at a banana boat country, in a 10th world country.

[01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:42.210]
All right, well, we're just doing spot checks here

[01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:43.370]
to see who's not even nice.

[01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:44.910]
What if you're late for work?

[01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:46.270]
What if you're out here doing the job?

[01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:47.490]
How about you with the spot checks to see who's got,

[01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:49.630]
see, this is a state where we have no auto inspection

[01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:51.370]
by the way, which I've been screaming about for years

[01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:52.350]
and we'll never get it back.

[01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:55.710]
We got the thing where they stick that, you know,

[01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:57.590]
the tube up your recto that can shake you down

[01:16:57.590 --> 01:17:00.670]
for 10 bucks, is if they really care about emissions,

[01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:04.530]
they're more concerned about other squads,

[01:17:04.530 --> 01:17:06.310]
squirting emissions is what they're really concerned about,

[01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:09.690]
but nevertheless, auto inspection,

[01:17:09.970 --> 01:17:11.610]
people with bald tires with no headlights,

[01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:13.210]
with no braised, their little brown coupe,

[01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:14.530]
does anybody care about that?

[01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:14.870]
No.

[01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:17.230]
They don't give a crap about that.

[01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:18.570]
That's not what they're looking for.

[01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:21.970]
They're looking for something to really stick it to you for,

[01:17:22.090 --> 01:17:25.130]
baby, so they can, why don't we just fill the prison

[01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:25.990]
out every street corner?

[01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:29.030]
We could put all the goddamn drug criminals out there,

[01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:31.890]
the drug abusers in the jail for like the rest of their lives

[01:17:31.890 --> 01:17:32.710]
and throw the key away.

[01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:35.910]
Everybody who ever smoked a joint,

[01:17:36.130 --> 01:17:39.170]
everybody who ever had a goddamn joint in their possession,

[01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:41.450]
everybody who ever had a goddamn roach in their ass rate,

[01:17:41.670 --> 01:17:43.450]
anybody that ever knew somebody that, you know,

[01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:45.850]
and of course, if you ever inhale for Christ,

[01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:47.890]
say, that's a luxury cheer right away.

[01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:53.730]
We're talking about a government of lunatic, fascist, maniacs,

[01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:57.090]
and that's why every time I pick up my paper in the morning,

[01:17:57.170 --> 01:17:59.270]
we'll be hearing it all over, and I want to throw up.

[01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:01.890]
I want to puke.

[01:18:03.650 --> 01:18:05.510]
And, and of course, leave it to the hero.

[01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:06.370]
Who do you think they endorsed?

[01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:08.330]
Who do you think the hero would endorse last Sunday?

[01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:10.770]
How many guesses do you need to get who's with the B?

[01:18:12.610 --> 01:18:14.810]
And I read the whole convoluted argument,

[01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:17.870]
and it says in there toward the end of their editorial endorsement,

[01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:21.230]
it says, even though philosophically, on most of the issues,

[01:18:21.450 --> 01:18:23.010]
we agree more with Buddy McCay.

[01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:27.950]
And despite of that, we think that Jeb Bush has got the foresight

[01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:30.510]
and the vision to lead us into a new state of fashion,

[01:18:30.670 --> 01:18:31.410]
or whatever it said.

[01:18:31.410 --> 01:18:32.210]
How do you like that?

[01:18:32.890 --> 01:18:35.010]
In other words, what they're saying is that if we know what's good

[01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:38.350]
for us as we continue pandering to a certain constituency

[01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:41.350]
in this town, we damn well better endorse Jeb Bush.

[01:18:41.490 --> 01:18:42.150]
That's what they said.

[01:18:44.050 --> 01:18:45.750]
Because if you're reading in the hero,

[01:18:45.970 --> 01:18:47.510]
you know beyond a shadow of it out,

[01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:49.150]
it's what's good for the hero.

[01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:53.730]
Whether it's about politics, whether it's about casino gambling,

[01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:56.170]
whatever it's about, whether it's about building out arena,

[01:18:56.170 --> 01:18:58.590]
they're building down there, right now by the hero's property,

[01:18:58.590 --> 01:19:00.790]
they're with Mickey Ererson and company.

[01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.450]
If it's good for the hero,

[01:19:03.630 --> 01:19:06.010]
then they'll give you all the propaganda that you can suck down.

[01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:09.590]
Here's Pompano. Hello.

[01:19:11.410 --> 01:19:11.810]
Pompano.

[01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:13.250]
Here's Pompano, no.

[01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:13.770]
Yes, sir.

[01:19:14.230 --> 01:19:15.970]
All right, I got a story at a DC for you.

[01:19:16.810 --> 01:19:17.470]
Can you really hear you?

[01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:19.950]
I got a story at a DC for you.

[01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:24.270]
Yeah, six months ago, it's all over a car.

[01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:27.230]
Nice band, Jonathan Ward, one of the Rapper neighborhood.

[01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.770]
Yeah.

[01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:28.790]
Here's some windows.

[01:19:29.010 --> 01:19:30.950]
I don't know when that inside the figure they got.

[01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:32.330]
Got a jug deal or something.

[01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:32.530]
Yeah.

[01:19:32.690 --> 01:19:33.510]
Pulled the guy out of the car.

[01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:36.450]
It's Rob Strypton point guard for the wizards.

[01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.810]
Yeah.

[01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:40.010]
I mean, they just think I'm with a DUI or something.

[01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:41.310]
Never follow up on him.

[01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.950]
He's crazy.

[01:19:43.630 --> 01:19:45.010]
Okay, pal, thanks for the good news.

[01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:46.470]
What do you say?

[01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:48.710]
He said something about the old Washington.

[01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:50.670]
Bullets were going to change their name.

[01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:52.890]
We have an open line and ditched up any C-guards.

[01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:53.570]
I'll tell you that.

[01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:54.470]
Woo!

[01:19:54.930 --> 01:19:55.550]
Heavy duty.

[01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:57.750]
Yeah, somebody has attended our cigars.

[01:19:59.290 --> 01:20:00.870]
Here's a call from Naples, hello?

[01:20:01.710 --> 01:20:02.170]
Hello.

[01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.750]
Yes, sir.

[01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:05.650]
I'd like to comment from a physician's point of view

[01:20:05.650 --> 01:20:08.810]
regarding prohibition, which you so accurately describe.

[01:20:09.150 --> 01:20:09.370]
Yes.

[01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:14.970]
A pharmacist turned me in for prescribing opioid or narcotic.

[01:20:15.850 --> 01:20:19.570]
And the Florida Board of Medicine ran me all over the state.

[01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:22.850]
It's the psychiatrist, it's the atemical dependency.

[01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:27.350]
And after a convoluted, extremely expensive experience,

[01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:29.790]
the Board of Medicine found nothing

[01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:34.750]
and I was exonial, rated, but it was a very awful experience.

[01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:39.730]
And what is yield is that patients are unable to get treated

[01:20:39.730 --> 01:20:40.290]
at the same time.

[01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:44.990]
So with prohibition, people are going to have to know

[01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:48.490]
that they're responsible for, we need more people like you.

[01:20:48.650 --> 01:20:49.310]
That's my comment.

[01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:49.850]
Thank you, sir.

[01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:50.890]
Thank you so much.

[01:20:51.050 --> 01:20:51.250]
Okay.

[01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:52.770]
There's Dr. Jack.

[01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:53.870]
I mean, a doctor in Naples.

[01:20:54.230 --> 01:20:55.130]
Yeah, that's another thing.

[01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:56.790]
You can't even offer yourself without the government

[01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:57.810]
sticking their nose in there.

[01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:59.770]
Dr. Jack, he's trying to help these damn people

[01:20:59.770 --> 01:21:02.490]
who want to die in peace and they're, they're terminally yield.

[01:21:03.230 --> 01:21:04.610]
Government's got to stick their nose in there.

[01:21:04.710 --> 01:21:05.410]
You can't do that.

[01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:09.550]
Because we got a bunch of people who are right to life people.

[01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:10.510]
How much do a doctor?

[01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:14.050]
Who commits a performance abortion?

[01:21:14.210 --> 01:21:15.330]
We have two open lines in date.

[01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:16.270]
From a hell.

[01:21:16.450 --> 01:21:18.350]
Beware of exploding balls.

[01:21:18.730 --> 01:21:19.610]
It was at gold.

[01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:21.130]
Somebody know how to hold it in front of them

[01:21:21.130 --> 01:21:21.850]
these two in these days?

[01:21:22.170 --> 01:21:23.110]
Everybody know how?

[01:21:23.230 --> 01:21:24.450]
Come on, we want the guy they answer.

[01:21:24.570 --> 01:21:25.190]
Inquiring mine.

[01:21:25.230 --> 01:21:26.130]
No, we want to know.

[01:21:27.230 --> 01:21:29.310]
16 to 1 at 560 WQM.

[01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.990]
We have two open lines.

[01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:31.590]
Here's Miami.

[01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.970]
Hello.

[01:21:32.690 --> 01:21:33.650]
Neil, yes, sir.

[01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:37.070]
Hey, don't I'd like to talk about the supposed drug

[01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.950]
work for a minute.

[01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:38.410]
Yeah.

[01:21:38.530 --> 01:21:40.730]
Oh my God, you're getting a little bit revolutionary

[01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:41.470]
there now, sir.

[01:21:41.710 --> 01:21:42.110]
Education.

[01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:45.330]
Yeah, informing the public about the realities

[01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:47.690]
of what this is all about, teaching our kids about drugs,

[01:21:47.690 --> 01:21:48.910]
honestly and openly.

[01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:50.130]
Absolutely, you know what?

[01:21:50.190 --> 01:21:52.470]
It's just a boutikrant and not a run.

[01:21:52.670 --> 01:21:53.150]
Romantic.

[01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:56.030]
And not only that, we'll be able to keep these beef.

[01:21:56.190 --> 01:21:59.870]
Yeah, the average time that a murderer spends in prison

[01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:01.410]
in this country is nine years.

[01:22:01.810 --> 01:22:04.830]
We have people serving, three people serving life sentences

[01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:07.370]
without eligibility for parole in this country

[01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:09.730]
because they were going too many plants in their backyard.

[01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.910]
It's just unbelievable.

[01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:13.790]
At one, one more thing, you know, I'm a musician.

[01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:16.950]
I was out last night at the spa and not cars come up.

[01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:18.810]
They shine the lights in my car.

[01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:19.130]

[01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:20.530]
You know, they've seen them.

[01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:22.350]
I have a little bit of my hair's a little long

[01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:23.050]
so it's my friend.

[01:22:23.150 --> 01:22:23.450]
I have all these.

[01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:25.130]
And all the musicians don't forget.

[01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:26.810]
Yeah, they probably are since then.

[01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:28.870]
Oh, you know, they went through my whole car

[01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:31.830]
to talk to my bags and stuff that I might equipment in,

[01:22:31.930 --> 01:22:34.130]
went through that, went through everything in my car.

[01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.590]
Right.

[01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:37.310]
And then they have nothing to do out there.

[01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:38.570]
They're like bored and it's fine.

[01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:39.370]
And what did they find?

[01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:39.970]
Nothing.

[01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:41.290]
Absolutely.

[01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:43.550]
Positively, nothing.

[01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:44.170]
The big.

[01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:45.830]
Oh, unbelievable.

[01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:46.010]
They're incredible.

[01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:47.750]
Okay, pal.

[01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:50.350]
Yeah, he's got a long hair.

[01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:52.890]
He's a musician, which I'm sure they must have sensed it.

[01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:55.170]
They got that sixth sense, that sixth sense.

[01:22:57.110 --> 01:23:01.590]
A police-epping state, baby, make no mistake about it.

[01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:02.670]
You're in it.

[01:23:04.090 --> 01:23:04.990]
Two open lines.

[01:23:05.290 --> 01:23:06.730]
Here's a lady mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.970]
Hello.

[01:23:07.690 --> 01:23:08.290]
You're up the line.

[01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:09.770]
Lady mobile.

[01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:10.990]
Yes, I'm out there.

[01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:13.010]
I'm a first time call from Connecticut

[01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:15.430]
and I've been enjoying listening to you.

[01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:16.710]
I agree with a lot of your point.

[01:23:17.670 --> 01:23:19.510]
I kind of have a hard time listening to you

[01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:21.170]
because you do take out the name and the name a lot,

[01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:22.630]
which kind of bumps me out a little bit.

[01:23:22.690 --> 01:23:22.930]
Right.

[01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:23.950]
I'm afraid of my speech.

[01:23:24.150 --> 01:23:25.430]
We have freedom of speech in this country,

[01:23:25.630 --> 01:23:27.610]
so we'll just because I personally am a Christian,

[01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:29.070]
I don't think I'd name the name and the name and the name

[01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:30.830]
and I do think that you're like a stupid.

[01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:32.130]
You're entitled to believe whatever you're hearing.

[01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:32.470]
That's right.

[01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:33.890]
We're entitled to say whatever you like.

[01:23:33.970 --> 01:23:35.790]
But I do like listening to you.

[01:23:35.970 --> 01:23:36.890]
It does make it a little hard.

[01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:38.330]
But anyway, I wanted to ask you a couple questions

[01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:39.830]
about some restaurants you were talking about.

[01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:41.950]
When Mexican restaurants are on, how's it going?

[01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:42.730]
Two and a five.

[01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:44.270]
So go back to Connecticut, lady.

[01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:46.210]
OK, before it's too goddamn late.

[01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:47.230]
Oh, sorry.

[01:23:48.530 --> 01:23:50.130]
What is she talking about?

[01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:51.950]
Prickly pairs.

[01:23:52.350 --> 01:23:55.190]
Yeah, I got a prickly pair for you, sweetheart.

[01:23:56.650 --> 01:23:58.930]
Two open lines at day five, six, seven,

[01:23:59.030 --> 01:24:01.030]
oh, five, six, the, and pound, six, the,

[01:24:01.090 --> 01:24:01.890]
on a mobile one line.

[01:24:02.530 --> 01:24:02.930]
Absolutely.

[01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:03.550]
In the way.

[01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.990]
Jesus.

[01:24:04.210 --> 01:24:05.690]
Go back to Connecticut, OK?

[01:24:05.930 --> 01:24:07.050]
They can't even pronounce it right.

[01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:09.650]
They're either spelling it wrong or pronouncing it wrong.

[01:24:09.930 --> 01:24:10.990]
Can't even have it both ways.

[01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:13.650]
Here's four-letter deal.

[01:24:13.650 --> 01:24:13.850]
Hello.

[01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:15.810]
Hey, yes, sir.

[01:24:16.290 --> 01:24:18.590]
I'm surprised you haven't had a lot of voters calling you.

[01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:20.070]
The Coast Guard is just as bad.

[01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:22.190]
I mean, you can have a nice, leisurely sail

[01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:24.470]
off the family or somewhere.

[01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:24.930]
Yeah.

[01:24:25.230 --> 01:24:27.870]
And you think you're going to, if you do it very many times,

[01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:29.550]
you're going to be aborted by the Coast Guard.

[01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:32.690]
And the reason is they're going to board a sailboat

[01:24:32.690 --> 01:24:34.750]
or something like that because they've

[01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:36.030]
got to have so many boardings in a month.

[01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:37.490]
And why was that?

[01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:38.810]
In other words, they got a quota for that too,

[01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:39.750]
which I'm sure they would deny.

[01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:42.630]
Just like they've got a quota for writing tickets, which, of course,

[01:24:42.630 --> 01:24:43.470]
so we know they do.

[01:24:43.630 --> 01:24:45.530]
But why would they want to board a drug boat

[01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:46.470]
where they make it shot?

[01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:47.910]
Right, that's my friend.

[01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:48.630]
That is the one.

[01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:51.150]
My friend said he's both torn up by them.

[01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:53.510]
He had the boat torn up?

[01:24:53.770 --> 01:24:55.830]
Well, carrying a part, pulling off panels,

[01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:57.590]
and everything going through looking for drugs.

[01:24:59.790 --> 01:25:02.330]
And he never has used drugs, never would.

[01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:02.750]
Yeah.

[01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:04.270]
And but they've gone out there.

[01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:06.010]
And his friends have had the same experience.

[01:25:06.150 --> 01:25:08.330]
I'm surprised you haven't had more voters calling about me.

[01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:09.030]
Maybe we were all involved.

[01:25:09.170 --> 01:25:10.790]
I guess the message is stay inside.

[01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:12.950]
Lock the doors real tight and stay inside.

[01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:13.290]
Thank you.

[01:25:13.450 --> 01:25:13.930]
OK, pal.

[01:25:14.490 --> 01:25:17.070]
Just lock me, just like pretend we're having a hurricane.

[01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:18.910]
Pretend that big one that's down there in a gulf.

[01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:19.890]
Pretend it's up here.

[01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:22.930]
Just shut her up the house, board up the doors,

[01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:25.410]
nail it, shut from the inside, get a lot of your supplies.

[01:25:25.410 --> 01:25:27.130]
Of course, first, that's a good idea.

[01:25:27.650 --> 01:25:28.990]
Or maybe just leave a little room under the door.

[01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:31.310]
They can slip the stuff, have one of those doggy doors.

[01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:34.310]
And that's it.

[01:25:36.170 --> 01:25:37.950]
Because our government is busy looking

[01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:39.170]
to harass the hell out of you.

[01:25:39.170 --> 01:25:39.790]
I'm sorry.

[01:25:39.930 --> 01:25:41.130]
I wish I had the time.

[01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:42.050]
I wish I had the hours.

[01:25:42.850 --> 01:25:45.290]
And I wish it weren't so boring to read stuff on the air.

[01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:46.350]
Because it really is.

[01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:47.290]
I don't like reading on here.

[01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:48.530]
I've done a lot of it the last few days.

[01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:50.710]
But this book is just amazing.

[01:25:51.190 --> 01:25:51.530]
Oh, I am.

[01:25:52.670 --> 01:25:54.130]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:25:54.230 --> 01:25:54.410]
Hello.

[01:25:54.930 --> 01:25:55.470]
Hello, Neil.

[01:25:55.690 --> 01:25:57.810]
I hope nothing had done to my trouble

[01:25:57.810 --> 01:25:59.970]
as things I've heard the last few days on your show.

[01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:02.950]
It is a poor guy that got busted for a role as a ZXZ paper.

[01:26:03.130 --> 01:26:04.690]
I was living when I heard that.

[01:26:04.730 --> 01:26:04.910]
Yeah.

[01:26:05.490 --> 01:26:07.230]
I've let you know in Amsterdam since I've

[01:26:07.230 --> 01:26:08.050]
been talking about that a lot.

[01:26:08.050 --> 01:26:10.590]
Many of the people I would even be willing to say

[01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:13.190]
there whatever in the mood, but they do roll their own cigarettes.

[01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:14.190]
What have they done?

[01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:15.270]
They still roll their own cigarettes.

[01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:19.090]
What whiteers of government have to assume they may be right.

[01:26:19.290 --> 01:26:20.850]
But I mean, they still have proof there.

[01:26:21.230 --> 01:26:24.030]
In the 1930s says this book by James Boulevard.

[01:26:24.370 --> 01:26:26.190]
The Soviet regime rewarded young children

[01:26:26.190 --> 01:26:27.390]
who betrayed the authorities.

[01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:29.670]
Words of criticism their parents had spoken

[01:26:29.670 --> 01:26:30.790]
about the great Stalin.

[01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:35.050]
As Robert Conquest noted in his classic history,

[01:26:35.170 --> 01:26:37.170]
the great terror, Stalin's purge of the 30s,

[01:26:37.170 --> 01:26:39.250]
Stalin's idea of a good young communist

[01:26:39.250 --> 01:26:41.770]
demanded the qualities of an enthusiastic young narc.

[01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:46.710]
Some critics alleged that the public schools

[01:26:46.710 --> 01:26:48.710]
are now adopting some of Stalin's methods.

[01:26:49.230 --> 01:26:50.870]
Drug abuse resistance education,

[01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:53.250]
dear, is currently being taught by police officers.

[01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:54.530]
There's more than five million children,

[01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:56.310]
police, the names of people and children's suspect,

[01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:57.750]
are illegally using drugs.

[01:26:58.210 --> 01:27:00.470]
A mother and father in Caroline County, Maryland,

[01:27:00.650 --> 01:27:01.750]
were jailed for 30 days.

[01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:03.450]
After they daughter informed a policeman

[01:27:03.450 --> 01:27:04.910]
providing a school anti-drug program

[01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:07.490]
that her parents had marijuana plants in her home.

[01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.870]
Oh!

[01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:15.170]
Proficy seven at five, 60 W. Keebani loves A.L.

[01:27:15.570 --> 01:27:17.570]
The Neil Rogers-Shelotterdale.

[01:27:17.650 --> 01:27:19.270]
It's not just the one to two hour,

[01:27:19.730 --> 01:27:20.610]
it's a phenomenon.

[01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:24.530]
Ains dry by shooting range.

[01:27:24.850 --> 01:27:25.230]
That's right.

[01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:27.230]
Practice your shooting skills from the comfort

[01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:28.350]
of your own elderado.

[01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:30.910]
Target are designed to simulate your turf rivals.

[01:27:31.290 --> 01:27:33.510]
Listen to one of our satisfied customers, Ice Coffee.

[01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:37.030]
Go abuse services of aim for one time,

[01:27:37.190 --> 01:27:39.810]
even with my cabin by 20% on the bank.

[01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.930]
That's right, Ice.

[01:27:41.230 --> 01:27:43.630]
Watch your body count climb and just one short week at aim.

[01:27:44.010 --> 01:27:45.690]
With a cape from hollow point five, green rounds,

[01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:47.590]
you get one pass at the drive range free.

[01:27:47.970 --> 01:27:50.210]
Remember, we at aim, aim simply.

[01:27:51.870 --> 01:27:53.550]
103 at five, 60 WQM.

[01:27:53.630 --> 01:27:55.230]
By the way, your hon, your fax is great,

[01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:56.670]
which I will read in a couple of minutes,

[01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:58.570]
but one copy would have been enough, not 100.

[01:27:58.990 --> 01:28:00.810]
Speaking of one copy, our friend over there,

[01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:02.870]
Julio and Dave County have an enemy ran out of phone calls

[01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:04.870]
and is desperate to talk to people in this audience.

[01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:06.950]
Desperate for an audience, 305.

[01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:09.070]
Wait, 305, eight, two.

[01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:11.750]
So anyway, your hon writes to this fax.

[01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:13.590]
He says the problem is this country is that everything

[01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:16.050]
is demonized, things as natural as nudity.

[01:28:16.210 --> 01:28:18.630]
For example, in Europe, you see nudity on TV all the time,

[01:28:18.670 --> 01:28:19.310]
which yes you do.

[01:28:19.770 --> 01:28:21.030]
If you're watching a Brockhamer,

[01:28:21.090 --> 01:28:22.370]
so you say in Europe, you go to the beach,

[01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:24.090]
everybody is butt naked and so what?

[01:28:24.190 --> 01:28:25.490]
The body is nothing to be ashamed of.

[01:28:25.710 --> 01:28:27.410]
The way kids are raised in Europe by the time they get

[01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:29.330]
to be a teenager, they view the body as natural.

[01:28:29.670 --> 01:28:31.630]
And since they see it naked all the time, both on TV

[01:28:31.630 --> 01:28:33.590]
and at the beach, there's no demonization of it.

[01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:34.810]
They don't feel the need to hide it.

[01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:36.890]
Look at porno magazines of the covers and movies,

[01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:38.610]
et cetera, and by the way, those things just mess up

[01:28:38.610 --> 01:28:40.210]
people's minds, you said, because of the way

[01:28:40.210 --> 01:28:41.490]
they did great, et cetera, and so on.

[01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:43.590]
Also, in Europe, the minute you're old enough

[01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:45.670]
to hold onto a glass, they serve your wine or beer

[01:28:45.670 --> 01:28:47.490]
but after these police officers don't have guns,

[01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:49.590]
they only have a baton and most of them ride a bike

[01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:50.990]
and they get a lot of respect over there

[01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:52.630]
because they're not intimidating like over here

[01:28:52.630 --> 01:28:53.910]
and they treat people well.

[01:28:54.230 --> 01:28:56.010]
And the crime rate in all of your put together

[01:28:56.010 --> 01:28:58.650]
is less than one big city in the US today.

[01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:59.950]
Right on target, Johan?

[01:28:59.950 --> 01:29:02.670]
The one fax would have been enough, but thank you.

[01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:05.750]
Two open lines in Dave County.

[01:29:05.890 --> 01:29:06.470]
Wireless line.

[01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:08.810]
Here's a West Palm Beach, hello.

[01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:10.770]
Daniel, good show today, man.

[01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:11.150]
Yes, sir.

[01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:13.810]
You know, the show won A&E American Justice

[01:29:13.810 --> 01:29:14.730]
with Bill Curtis, right?

[01:29:15.310 --> 01:29:17.990]
They did an expo's day on the stormtrooper season

[01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.710]
people's assets.

[01:29:19.150 --> 01:29:19.430]
Really?

[01:29:19.770 --> 01:29:22.170]
And they had, it was the highest, the best response

[01:29:22.170 --> 01:29:24.050]
they ever got from the viewers after that show.

[01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.790]
How do you like that?

[01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:27.510]
While they're doing the show, they're interviewing people,

[01:29:27.730 --> 01:29:29.210]
who do you think is stating his front of the camera

[01:29:29.210 --> 01:29:31.670]
talking about it, the victims of the stormtroopers,

[01:29:31.710 --> 01:29:32.550]
not the stormtroopers.

[01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:33.910]
They're all hiding their faces in shame,

[01:29:34.110 --> 01:29:36.170]
going into their little castles.

[01:29:36.330 --> 01:29:36.470]
Right.

[01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:39.990]
And that was the highest response they ever got

[01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.990]
from one of their shows.

[01:29:41.150 --> 01:29:43.390]
Sure, because it goes on all the time in these little people,

[01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:45.110]
they got nowhere to turn and they have to spend their life

[01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:46.790]
savings to hire lawyers to try to defend them

[01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:49.010]
and get their property back or whatever it is that they took.

[01:29:49.210 --> 01:29:50.290]
And it's a nightmare.

[01:29:50.710 --> 01:29:51.590]
That's the whole thing.

[01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:53.750]
The people have no resources, no recourse.

[01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:54.050]
Right.

[01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:55.450]
They said the lawyers would definitely not

[01:29:55.450 --> 01:29:56.270]
get friends doing anything about it

[01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:57.010]
because they're making money.

[01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:58.530]
Because they just come in

[01:29:58.530 --> 01:30:00.290]
and they make it up as they go along.

[01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:01.450]
And here's another thing.

[01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:03.370]
I mean, this is definitely something that happens.

[01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:05.130]
I'm a white guy driving a pick up truck.

[01:30:05.410 --> 01:30:07.090]
How often do you think I get half a bite of cops

[01:30:07.090 --> 01:30:08.030]
for driving down the ferrope?

[01:30:08.170 --> 01:30:08.990]
I get more factor nine.

[01:30:09.730 --> 01:30:10.050]
Never.

[01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:10.430]
Yeah.

[01:30:11.050 --> 01:30:11.370]
Never.

[01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:13.610]
Well, that's just it.

[01:30:13.930 --> 01:30:14.210]
OK.

[01:30:14.530 --> 01:30:15.090]
I have to get that.

[01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:16.330]
I guess the message is light enough.

[01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:17.310]
Yep, there you go.

[01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.990]
I'll have to write it.

[01:30:18.610 --> 01:30:20.330]
All you dark, complexed folks out there

[01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:22.430]
and including some of you too far-tanned hoolios,

[01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:23.710]
you're better lighten up a little bit,

[01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:26.150]
get some chlorox, bleach it out, win and doubt.

[01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:28.430]
Because otherwise they're going to be stopping you

[01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:29.710]
in Haslund, your goddamn life.

[01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:32.830]
Two open lines in Dade County, 5'670560,

[01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:35.490]
0.560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:37.150]
Here's Tamara.

[01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:37.470]
Hello?

[01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:38.690]
Uncle Leo.

[01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:39.250]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:39.890]
What's up, sweetheart?

[01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:41.350]
What we knew for you, pal?

[01:30:41.570 --> 01:30:43.910]
Hey, I went up to visit my son up in Northern Florida,

[01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:44.230]
right?

[01:30:44.330 --> 01:30:44.570]
One time.

[01:30:44.850 --> 01:30:45.030]
Yeah.

[01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:46.730]
I come back, get off the plane,

[01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:47.710]
I go down to the car,

[01:30:47.710 --> 01:30:48.910]
it's all I go to use the payphone.

[01:30:49.810 --> 01:30:51.630]
I get off the payphone, I go walk in a way,

[01:30:51.770 --> 01:30:53.230]
two cops come up, show me the right,

[01:30:53.410 --> 01:30:54.430]
did they want to look into my bag?

[01:30:54.710 --> 01:30:54.910]
Yeah.

[01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:56.790]
I said, why are you looking at my bag?

[01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:59.170]
Well, you fit the image of carrying drugs.

[01:30:59.430 --> 01:31:00.730]
Huh, nice, huh?

[01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:02.670]
Now, in what way did you fit the image?

[01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:04.190]
Because I had one here at the time,

[01:31:04.190 --> 01:31:05.530]
I had a full back in a ponytail.

[01:31:05.730 --> 01:31:06.470]
Oh, a drug dealer.

[01:31:06.670 --> 01:31:06.950]
No question.

[01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.490]
Major, Major.

[01:31:08.570 --> 01:31:10.350]
So I told him I said, no, no wait.

[01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:14.010]
They said they've been over one of their other superiors.

[01:31:14.290 --> 01:31:14.450]
Yeah.

[01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:16.050]
He asked if he can look in it.

[01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:17.990]
I said, no, if I'm not going to let these two,

[01:31:18.090 --> 01:31:18.770]
why should I let you?

[01:31:19.630 --> 01:31:21.090]
He goes, can we put a dog on it?

[01:31:21.230 --> 01:31:23.150]
I said, fine, they're going to dog out, put it on.

[01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:26.810]
Bring the dog out, dog tears into my bag.

[01:31:27.810 --> 01:31:29.490]
They open it up, nothing in there.

[01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:31.390]
Up to the side, we made a mistake.

[01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:32.030]
Uh-huh.

[01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:33.150]
Nice deal, huh?

[01:31:33.290 --> 01:31:35.270]
So Papa don't have a brand new bag, is that what you're saying?

[01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.990]
That's what I'm saying.

[01:31:36.170 --> 01:31:37.370]
Hey, can I call somebody to do this bag?

[01:31:37.490 --> 01:31:37.730]
Go ahead.

[01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:39.470]
New car engine or major, do this bag.

[01:31:39.650 --> 01:31:39.890]
OK.

[01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:42.950]
OK, we're not a couple of calls on the board.

[01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:44.190]
Like the guy said before, these phones

[01:31:44.190 --> 01:31:45.450]
ought to be ringing off the hook, they ought

[01:31:45.450 --> 01:31:46.210]
to be smoking here.

[01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:47.550]
But they're not because they, you know,

[01:31:47.610 --> 01:31:48.930]
a little bit of excitement, they're not

[01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:49.430]
seeing the bad.

[01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:53.210]
Because the public out there, they're used to this.

[01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:53.950]
They like it.

[01:31:54.170 --> 01:31:55.630]
They like to live in like a bunch of lemmings

[01:31:55.630 --> 01:31:57.570]
and a bunch of sheep and they like to be put upon.

[01:31:58.110 --> 01:31:59.710]
Two open lines, and they, two and brown,

[01:31:59.790 --> 01:32:01.430]
five, six, seven, oh five, 60,

[01:32:01.810 --> 01:32:03.190]
pom five, 60 on the 18th deal.

[01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:06.410]
And by the way, as much as this equipment we got in here,

[01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:08.310]
is garbage, I should have mentioned this on the year before.

[01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:11.510]
All of a sudden, just as quickly as the problem started

[01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:13.510]
about a little bit after 10 o'clock this morning,

[01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:16.250]
after the first two calls, just as quickly as the problem

[01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:18.850]
from Bell South began, and that's where it originated.

[01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:20.210]
And that's where most of it is.

[01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:21.970]
And I understand that and know that for a fact.

[01:32:22.850 --> 01:32:25.370]
Just as quickly as it started, a little bit later on,

[01:32:25.450 --> 01:32:27.010]
when they decided to unscrew up,

[01:32:27.150 --> 01:32:28.110]
whatever was screwed up over there,

[01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:30.410]
all of a sudden the green lights came back on the lines.

[01:32:30.510 --> 01:32:30.970]
We're ringing again.

[01:32:31.230 --> 01:32:33.050]
So it wasn't on this end, sweethearts,

[01:32:33.170 --> 01:32:36.970]
over there at Bell South, who came diddlin' with my life.

[01:32:37.210 --> 01:32:39.050]
See, if I had a, like I said this yesterday,

[01:32:39.190 --> 01:32:41.550]
I'm not joking about this, if I had a real lawyer,

[01:32:41.850 --> 01:32:44.110]
a real agent, somebody to go to bed for me,

[01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:45.270]
I wouldn't have to be putting up

[01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:46.730]
with all this bull crap all these months.

[01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:49.490]
Like with a TV thing over there.

[01:32:49.650 --> 01:32:52.310]
Here, make a laughing stock out of you,

[01:32:52.530 --> 01:32:54.710]
with a hum job owner, they can't hear the audio.

[01:32:56.710 --> 01:32:58.170]
We got the guy named Phonkum,

[01:32:58.170 --> 01:32:59.690]
we got somebody involved over there

[01:32:59.690 --> 01:33:01.710]
that's been diddlin' with our stuff for months now.

[01:33:03.570 --> 01:33:05.210]
But do I have anybody to go to bed for me?

[01:33:05.410 --> 01:33:08.390]
Do I have anybody that even called after that roast job

[01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:09.470]
I did yesterday on him?

[01:33:09.690 --> 01:33:10.150]
Of course not.

[01:33:11.890 --> 01:33:13.630]
Cause I have to keep chasing him around.

[01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:14.830]
You're good for personal friends.

[01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:16.050]
Call today for what?

[01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:17.830]
Just see if I could, uh,

[01:33:18.190 --> 01:33:19.670]
fax in the copy of those notes.

[01:33:23.190 --> 01:33:25.170]
You can turn with a lot of mad, I didn't think.

[01:33:25.210 --> 01:33:26.470]
If you could turn the clock back

[01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:28.090]
and go into yesterday's waste basket,

[01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:29.310]
which is where they were deposited,

[01:33:29.710 --> 01:33:31.250]
and get out your super glue

[01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:33.570]
and glue or tape all the pieces of the paper together

[01:33:33.570 --> 01:33:35.210]
that I tore up in little tiny pieces.

[01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:40.650]
Man, oh man, there's only one thing I can say.

[01:33:41.150 --> 01:33:42.430]
One thing about normal chem.

[01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:44.550]
Boy, does he have a lot of crits?

[01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.930]
A-L.

[01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:47.750]
And me, that greater me.

[01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:52.610]
If Orbiz, he can call Julio at 305, 821-1716,

[01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:54.250]
he's done, he wants to do his own show.

[01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:56.230]
Here's a lady in West Palm Beach, hello?

[01:33:57.310 --> 01:33:57.770]
Any else?

[01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:58.390]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:33:58.590 --> 01:34:00.370]
A few years ago, I lived in Northern California

[01:34:00.370 --> 01:34:01.730]
a little bit north of San Francisco.

[01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:04.370]
Elementary school children were being encouraged

[01:34:04.370 --> 01:34:06.470]
by the school to turn their parents in.

[01:34:06.630 --> 01:34:06.750]
Right.

[01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:09.030]
They learned to recognize different drugs,

[01:34:09.370 --> 01:34:10.370]
ponds, things like that.

[01:34:10.490 --> 01:34:12.070]
Dear, to turn your hero parents in, right?

[01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:13.490]
To go home and turn your parents in

[01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:14.730]
and come back and tell your teachers

[01:34:14.730 --> 01:34:17.090]
that they can be arrested and you'd be an orphan and all that.

[01:34:17.210 --> 01:34:17.650]
And that's great.

[01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:18.690]
I think it's wonderful.

[01:34:19.690 --> 01:34:21.670]
But man, as far as everything goes,

[01:34:21.930 --> 01:34:24.030]
pot, your show, other TV shows,

[01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:26.370]
if people don't like it, why don't they leave it alone?

[01:34:26.690 --> 01:34:26.870]
Right.

[01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:28.030]
Just that comment.

[01:34:28.150 --> 01:34:28.930]
That's called freedom.

[01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:30.010]
It's called freedom of choice.

[01:34:30.150 --> 01:34:31.050]
It's called real freedom.

[01:34:31.730 --> 01:34:33.130]
And it's just like people are called,

[01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:34.250]
we're gonna get you out here.

[01:34:34.330 --> 01:34:35.750]
Well, first of all, they're not gonna get me out here.

[01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:37.430]
But secondly, why are they concerned?

[01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:39.410]
Why are they so psychotic about the fact

[01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:40.350]
that I'm saying something here

[01:34:40.350 --> 01:34:41.690]
that they can't deal with?

[01:34:41.690 --> 01:34:43.610]
So that's what bothers them is they can't handle the truth.

[01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:45.150]
It's the old Ron and not switch.

[01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.490]
You know?

[01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:47.050]
They can't do that.

[01:34:47.050 --> 01:34:47.950]
They don't want to turn it on.

[01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:51.750]
They want to silence me because their idea of freedom of speech

[01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:53.870]
is whatever they think is okay to be said.

[01:34:54.090 --> 01:34:55.790]
At the same time, they can't stop listening.

[01:34:55.970 --> 01:34:56.570]
Right, exactly.

[01:34:56.710 --> 01:34:57.510]
So what's up with that?

[01:34:57.910 --> 01:35:00.030]
Then I wonder, am I a policeman too?

[01:35:00.190 --> 01:35:01.870]
Because I am a service in the United States.

[01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.350]
Oh yeah.

[01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:03.690]
Does that mean I wouldn't,

[01:35:03.730 --> 01:35:06.090]
I think it should be illegal for people to worship

[01:35:06.090 --> 01:35:07.310]
false idols in church.

[01:35:07.650 --> 01:35:07.810]
Right.

[01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:08.690]
And should I?

[01:35:08.710 --> 01:35:10.410]
We have to start rating the churches and go in there.

[01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.750]
You're right.

[01:35:10.750 --> 01:35:12.670]
And we ought to start to bust those bastards.

[01:35:12.850 --> 01:35:15.430]
And how about driving 56 miles an hour stealing cable

[01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:16.550]
spitting on the sidewalk?

[01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.870]
Right.

[01:35:17.210 --> 01:35:18.410]
Making the Lord's name in vain.

[01:35:18.710 --> 01:35:18.910]
Right.

[01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:20.070]
We can take it pretty far.

[01:35:20.370 --> 01:35:22.350]
Who has another interesting thing going on in California

[01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:23.950]
quick rates, the Indian gaming?

[01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.550]
Right.

[01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:27.450]
Thing and they already have quite a bit of casinos,

[01:35:27.450 --> 01:35:29.170]
but they want more and they want it to be

[01:35:29.170 --> 01:35:30.530]
under a proposition five.

[01:35:30.670 --> 01:35:30.990]
Mm-hmm.

[01:35:32.010 --> 01:35:33.790]
And Vegas is peeing in their pants about it.

[01:35:33.790 --> 01:35:35.530]
They are peeing in their pants about it.

[01:35:35.670 --> 01:35:36.450]
They can't stand it.

[01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:37.750]
They're putting big money into it.

[01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:39.030]
And those are the only people opposed,

[01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:41.270]
but then they're ignorant fools who listen to that

[01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:44.350]
and think that it's important when they just don't have to go.

[01:35:44.530 --> 01:35:46.450]
I mean, why can't we hit it just like down here?

[01:35:46.630 --> 01:35:48.670]
I mean, we've been headed on the ballot about 200 times

[01:35:48.670 --> 01:35:50.070]
since I've been here 20 some years.

[01:35:50.290 --> 01:35:51.630]
It's never going to pass down here.

[01:35:51.870 --> 01:35:52.710]
And well, what's the big deal?

[01:35:52.770 --> 01:35:53.550]
We got dog racing.

[01:35:53.690 --> 01:35:54.590]
We got high-line.

[01:35:54.730 --> 01:35:55.570]
We got harness racing.

[01:35:55.690 --> 01:35:56.150]
Throwback racing.

[01:35:56.430 --> 01:35:57.830]
We got every kind of gambling out of the sun.

[01:35:58.050 --> 01:35:59.970]
We got Mickey Harrison and all his bogus cruise ships

[01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:02.170]
out here, which is gambling a ship to nowhere.

[01:36:02.630 --> 01:36:05.290]
But the casino gambling, it's evil and all this other

[01:36:05.290 --> 01:36:05.730]
bull crap.

[01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:07.510]
It's part of the same mentality.

[01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:11.090]
Well, yeah, I was listening to a hideous doctor the other day

[01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:14.470]
and at home and they said, don't the Indians have enough money now?

[01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:15.990]
Isn't that great?

[01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:17.070]
Don't they have enough?

[01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:19.010]
They've got running water now from the lab.

[01:36:19.050 --> 01:36:19.410]
Yeah, they have nothing.

[01:36:19.450 --> 01:36:20.290]
They got running water.

[01:36:20.370 --> 01:36:22.490]
They even might have a few flush toilets for Christ's.

[01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:23.430]
What the hell do they want?

[01:36:23.610 --> 01:36:24.430]
What do they want?

[01:36:24.730 --> 01:36:26.430]
And I think the big thing is, is that they're

[01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:28.770]
going to get the wide-eyed money because they're so freaking

[01:36:28.770 --> 01:36:29.030]
eggless.

[01:36:29.050 --> 01:36:29.910]
Well, it's about time.

[01:36:30.190 --> 01:36:30.910]
I hope so, now.

[01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:32.730]
And I hope there's worms and all those cigarettes too.

[01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:33.830]
Have a great day, sweetheart.

[01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.350]
You too.

[01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:34.770]
All right.

[01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:36.950]
We have two open lines.

[01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:38.190]
And Dave won and Broward.

[01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:39.890]
Getting kind of slim again here right now.

[01:36:39.970 --> 01:36:41.570]
I guess we must be putting these people into a coma.

[01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:42.670]
You know how this group is?

[01:36:42.690 --> 01:36:45.090]
Every 15 minutes they want something new to play to play with.

[01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:47.290]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:50.170]
Palm 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:36:50.250 --> 01:36:50.830]
We'll wait in on you.

[01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:52.130]
Here's Miami.

[01:36:52.190 --> 01:36:52.510]
Hello.

[01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.610]
Hi, I'm Gonyl.

[01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:54.090]
Yes, sir.

[01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:56.170]
You know, it is interesting that we're

[01:36:56.170 --> 01:36:57.950]
talking about people that don't want to do

[01:36:57.950 --> 01:37:00.390]
process, these police officers that are totally brainwashed.

[01:37:00.490 --> 01:37:02.810]
They have no interest in do process because there's

[01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:04.870]
a system you're guilty until proven innocent, which

[01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:07.890]
is absolutely contradictory to the American form of law.

[01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:11.210]
Yes, if they assume that you will look dangerous or that if you

[01:37:11.210 --> 01:37:14.310]
just bought an airline ticket per cash for a substantial amount of money,

[01:37:14.690 --> 01:37:16.990]
they're just assuming, therefore, you must be a drug dealer.

[01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:18.190]
You must be some kind of a criminal.

[01:37:18.430 --> 01:37:20.410]
And they're going to shake you down and terrorize your life.

[01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:23.050]
And then if they happen to be wrong, well, OK, too bad.

[01:37:23.290 --> 01:37:23.570]
Exactly.

[01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:26.070]
And I guess under the same corrupt model,

[01:37:26.370 --> 01:37:30.970]
why aren't banks with significant drug accounts confiscated

[01:37:30.970 --> 01:37:32.330]
like people's homes are confiscated?

[01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:32.870]
They have.

[01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:34.230]
Well, you know, it's real interesting.

[01:37:34.330 --> 01:37:35.610]
They have a controversy that goes on.

[01:37:35.630 --> 01:37:37.750]
I was just telling George during the last break that you remember

[01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:39.310]
years ago, I don't know how long you've been here.

[01:37:39.570 --> 01:37:42.290]
But back in the 70s and the middle and late 70s, when all the drug

[01:37:42.290 --> 01:37:44.650]
money was coming in here from Latin America before their pay

[01:37:44.650 --> 01:37:47.210]
so that their current CV came almost worthless.

[01:37:47.530 --> 01:37:50.830]
But before that, they used to come in here with brief cases loaded

[01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:51.710]
with cash.

[01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:52.830]
And it was all drug money.

[01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:55.810]
And they used to buy the big screen TVs and their VCRs and all

[01:37:55.810 --> 01:37:56.250]
the appliances.

[01:37:56.690 --> 01:37:59.110]
And then shipped them all back to South America where they were

[01:37:59.110 --> 01:37:59.310]
from.

[01:37:59.630 --> 01:38:01.030]
And everybody looked the other way.

[01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.630]
Exactly.

[01:38:01.630 --> 01:38:04.310]
We even had a mayor Maurice Faray who said at the time, well,

[01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:06.310]
you know, maybe there's a recession around the rest of the

[01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:08.710]
country, but we don't have to worry because it may be not the

[01:38:08.710 --> 01:38:09.250]
greatest thing.

[01:38:09.330 --> 01:38:11.050]
But at least we got all that drug money coming in here.

[01:38:11.190 --> 01:38:11.490]
Exactly.

[01:38:11.670 --> 01:38:13.050]
The mayor of the city who said that.

[01:38:13.150 --> 01:38:15.130]
If it weren't for those suitcase, it's a prickle avenue.

[01:38:15.250 --> 01:38:17.030]
Miami wouldn't have the banks that it has.

[01:38:17.150 --> 01:38:17.570]
That's right.

[01:38:17.770 --> 01:38:19.990]
And the development that happened in here wouldn't have occurred.

[01:38:20.170 --> 01:38:21.450]
And everybody looked the other way.

[01:38:21.710 --> 01:38:23.110]
You wanted to point it like to make out.

[01:38:23.170 --> 01:38:25.330]
I was just in Costa Rica with, I don't know if you've ever heard

[01:38:25.330 --> 01:38:25.670]
of Atlanta.

[01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:28.230]
It's a gay tour group.

[01:38:28.410 --> 01:38:30.510]
They take, yeah, I was down in Costa Rica with him.

[01:38:30.510 --> 01:38:33.430]
And everything was cool until the day we left one of the local

[01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:36.070]
women in government actually bought a Catholic priest and 400

[01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:38.790]
people to block the road so that our buses couldn't get to

[01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:39.210]
the airport.

[01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:40.590]
And they had riot police.

[01:38:41.170 --> 01:38:41.830]
They had riot police.

[01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.950]
They had riot police.

[01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:43.750]
He probably wanted to join in on a front.

[01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:46.130]
That's where we were wondering, you know, why didn't he jump

[01:38:46.130 --> 01:38:46.510]
on the bus?

[01:38:46.690 --> 01:38:49.830]
But they brought riot police to stop people from destroying

[01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:50.450]
these buses.

[01:38:50.710 --> 01:38:51.390]
By the road too.

[01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:54.070]
In a country that's supposedly where, you know, home of

[01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.910]
sexuality is not like that.

[01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:58.170]
I thought Costa Rica was like pretty progressive.

[01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.830]
So did we.

[01:38:58.830 --> 01:39:01.290]
We were on the Northwest Coast in Guadalajas de Pabegayo.

[01:39:01.450 --> 01:39:01.790]
And you know what?

[01:39:01.870 --> 01:39:05.030]
It was only the few of these hoedad Bible something middle,

[01:39:05.210 --> 01:39:08.570]
middle age mentality people because the people in the resort were

[01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:09.430]
nearly in tears.

[01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:11.270]
They were like, you know, we weren't sure about it when before

[01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:13.490]
you all came, but when you came here, the nicest cleanest people

[01:39:13.490 --> 01:39:14.250]
in the best neighborhood.

[01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:15.650]
These little bags in the church.

[01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:16.030]
Yes.

[01:39:16.190 --> 01:39:18.810]
So anybody out there who does a Catholic priest, these gay and

[01:39:18.810 --> 01:39:19.910]
in the house, you go get them.

[01:39:20.290 --> 01:39:22.650]
Hey, no, no, when you got a backwards, if anybody else

[01:39:22.650 --> 01:39:24.110]
would come to the castle and please, please, please,

[01:39:24.210 --> 01:39:25.470]
to a straight, please let me know.

[01:39:25.690 --> 01:39:26.450]
Have a great day, Phil.

[01:39:27.010 --> 01:39:29.350]
I've been asking 23 years I've been on a year, Miami.

[01:39:29.690 --> 01:39:31.890]
Give me the name of one Catholic priest who is straight.

[01:39:32.110 --> 01:39:33.650]
If you got one, just one.

[01:39:33.930 --> 01:39:34.990]
No, anywhere in the world.

[01:39:35.170 --> 01:39:35.810]
No, okay.

[01:39:37.710 --> 01:39:41.350]
And I'm telling you, all my contacts in Rome, I keep hearing

[01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:42.550]
more and more that they're positive.

[01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:43.670]
The Pope takes it up the record.

[01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:44.830]
There's no question about it.

[01:39:45.150 --> 01:39:46.050]
They know it for a fact.

[01:39:47.890 --> 01:39:50.590]
I mean, is there any guy who wears a dress for Christ's sake?

[01:39:50.670 --> 01:39:51.670]
And we always knew that.

[01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:53.650]
That's my style.

[01:39:54.130 --> 01:39:54.890]
We always knew that.

[01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:56.330]
So what are we talking about here?

[01:39:56.410 --> 01:39:57.510]
A little bit of hypocrisy, perhaps?

[01:39:57.610 --> 01:39:57.630]
No.

[01:39:58.630 --> 01:40:01.210]
Open line of date, county 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6,

[01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:03.490]
the Pope 5, 6, the on the 18th, the wireless line.

[01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:06.990]
The Holy O'Line is 305, 821 17, 16.

[01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:09.670]
Here is a Hollywood, hello.

[01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:11.150]
Hello.

[01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.730]
Yes, sir.

[01:40:12.050 --> 01:40:13.350]
Yes. How you doing?

[01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.690]
Great.

[01:40:14.170 --> 01:40:17.790]
I just want to say that the reason that this country is

[01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:22.170]
in the shape as it is in today, yes, is because we,

[01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:26.330]
the people, let these police agencies in these other forms

[01:40:26.330 --> 01:40:28.270]
of government get away with it.

[01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:28.570]
Yeah.

[01:40:28.570 --> 01:40:29.710]
Without it, that's the people.

[01:40:30.250 --> 01:40:31.810]
The people don't do nothing.

[01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:33.730]
Because they don't give a crap, because they're busy watching

[01:40:33.730 --> 01:40:35.910]
their stupid Dujury Springer and their TV shows,

[01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.950]
and they don't give a crap.

[01:40:37.390 --> 01:40:38.290]
That's the trick for you.

[01:40:38.770 --> 01:40:38.990]
Nobody does.

[01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:40.090]
If you listen to that, listen.

[01:40:40.290 --> 01:40:41.490]
If you listen to this radio station,

[01:40:41.650 --> 01:40:44.130]
the other 20 hours a day, and hear these assholes calling

[01:40:44.130 --> 01:40:46.050]
and hear about the gators, and the gators are going to

[01:40:46.050 --> 01:40:48.070]
kick your ass, I mean, everything has,

[01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:50.030]
you have to have a right perspective.

[01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:53.370]
And the problem is in this country, the priorities are all upside down.

[01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:57.450]
In fact, they got some dumb jack that's going to make $13 million a year

[01:40:57.450 --> 01:40:58.370]
for playing baseball.

[01:40:58.910 --> 01:40:59.970]
This is unacceptable.

[01:41:00.270 --> 01:41:03.330]
Is there been one person calling, make one comment about it, except me?

[01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:03.790]
No.

[01:41:04.150 --> 01:41:07.010]
No, and you can listen all day every day on this radio station,

[01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:10.230]
and these bozos, oh, what's the, what's the spread on this game?

[01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:13.210]
And you think the offensive line can handle it?

[01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:14.790]
I mean, what are we talking about here?

[01:41:14.810 --> 01:41:18.010]
Okay, we're talking about people whose interests are so disproportionate

[01:41:18.010 --> 01:41:19.910]
to what life is really all about, that it's hopeless.

[01:41:20.190 --> 01:41:20.790]
Yeah, you're right.

[01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.890]
You're 100% right.

[01:41:22.150 --> 01:41:24.030]
And don't ever forget, pal, whatever you do.

[01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:25.490]
That's the American way.

[01:41:25.850 --> 01:41:25.990]
Right.

[01:41:26.230 --> 01:41:26.590]
You're right.

[01:41:26.810 --> 01:41:27.430]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:41:27.450 --> 01:41:27.730]
You too.

[01:41:27.970 --> 01:41:28.550]
Get that passport.

[01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:32.410]
Oh, the word told that this is the greatest country in the world.

[01:41:32.590 --> 01:41:32.990]
You know what?

[01:41:33.130 --> 01:41:35.290]
Every time I hear that, it's like people

[01:41:35.290 --> 01:41:36.930]
that say Miami is a world-class city.

[01:41:37.190 --> 01:41:38.050]
I key in my pen.

[01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:40.330]
I have to call a June Allison to get my depends.

[01:41:41.150 --> 01:41:43.370]
Every time somebody says Miami is a world-class city.

[01:41:43.610 --> 01:41:44.890]
I just pee all over the place.

[01:41:44.970 --> 01:41:46.130]
My bladder just cuts loose.

[01:41:47.150 --> 01:41:48.490]
Every time I hear that.

[01:41:49.890 --> 01:41:51.990]
World-class crime, world-class bozos.

[01:41:52.190 --> 01:41:54.110]
All you got to do is read the columns in the newspapers.

[01:41:54.570 --> 01:41:56.250]
Read the columns in the sports section.

[01:41:57.650 --> 01:42:00.790]
Dave Hyde with another stupid idiotic column this morning.

[01:42:01.230 --> 01:42:02.490]
Oh, yeah, it's probably a good idea.

[01:42:02.670 --> 01:42:03.170]
This is what it was to.

[01:42:03.330 --> 01:42:03.830]
Yeah, right.

[01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:05.390]
Sure it was, Dave.

[01:42:05.770 --> 01:42:08.270]
Why don't you have the balls to really say something?

[01:42:08.430 --> 01:42:09.210]
That's the problem.

[01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:11.990]
Why doesn't anybody in this goddamn town

[01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:13.730]
have the balls to say anything?

[01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:16.550]
I have a long about, I'm going to ask you that question.

[01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:19.950]
How many ass suckers does it take to fill up the hours

[01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:21.670]
of the day on the air in this town and the newspapers?

[01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:23.490]
Ass suckers, pandeers.

[01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:27.350]
We got about 100 gildies.

[01:42:27.530 --> 01:42:29.250]
Only there's most of them have a better voice.

[01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:30.110]
That's the only difference.

[01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:32.350]
And maybe one descendant testicle.

[01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:34.830]
Here's a mobile and Davey.

[01:42:34.930 --> 01:42:35.070]
Hello.

[01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:36.310]
Hey, are you doing good?

[01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:36.990]
OK, sir.

[01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.490]
Good.

[01:42:37.890 --> 01:42:39.430]
OK, I'm going to get the problem for a second.

[01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:40.830]
But I'm going to tell you what I just saw.

[01:42:40.930 --> 01:42:41.810]
We're just going to freak you out.

[01:42:42.510 --> 01:42:44.250]
I was in a dope video store.

[01:42:44.850 --> 01:42:46.730]
OK, and I was looking at a dope video store.

[01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:47.810]
Oh my god.

[01:42:48.110 --> 01:42:48.290]
Yeah.

[01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:49.950]
OK, I was looking around, right?

[01:42:50.350 --> 01:42:52.370]
I see this group of girls about four.

[01:42:53.090 --> 01:42:54.270]
And then I'm wanting to myself.

[01:42:54.430 --> 01:42:55.090]
They want to have four?

[01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:56.070]
Four of them.

[01:42:56.370 --> 01:42:56.830]
One of them.

[01:42:57.030 --> 01:42:57.290]
Four of them.

[01:42:57.450 --> 01:42:58.610]
OK, I met about four years old, yeah.

[01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.430]
Yeah, right.

[01:43:00.170 --> 01:43:02.130]
OK, was that creative?

[01:43:02.410 --> 01:43:03.050]
Was that beautiful?

[01:43:04.130 --> 01:43:05.110]
Was that interesting?

[01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:07.030]
Was that the boring pal really weak?

[01:43:08.170 --> 01:43:09.810]
Oh god, here's the end.

[01:43:09.890 --> 01:43:11.490]
And didn't I have my fingers sitting right here

[01:43:11.490 --> 01:43:13.070]
because I knew it was going to be a polygraph.

[01:43:13.290 --> 01:43:14.230]
Thank you so much, pal.

[01:43:14.410 --> 01:43:14.970]
Very creative.

[01:43:15.490 --> 01:43:17.490]
You're just what we were talking about a minute ago.

[01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:20.710]
Bozo, they could be knocking on your door,

[01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:22.870]
raking your house right now, taking away every possession

[01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:25.010]
of yours, and you'd be making up stupid stories.

[01:43:25.210 --> 01:43:27.210]
OK, I think too many of those videos, there.

[01:43:27.290 --> 01:43:30.910]
Yeah, if you were OK, just let it heal up for a while.

[01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:31.570]
It might be good.

[01:43:32.730 --> 01:43:34.330]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:43:34.410 --> 01:43:34.590]
Hello?

[01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:36.630]
Welcome, Neil.

[01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:37.130]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:37.710 --> 01:43:39.950]
I got the biggest big report you've ever heard.

[01:43:40.150 --> 01:43:40.350]
Yeah.

[01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:42.170]
I just left in Macarena.

[01:43:43.570 --> 01:43:43.970]
Yeah.

[01:43:44.370 --> 01:43:47.650]
And in the South Parking Lot, there's at least 200 cop cars

[01:43:47.650 --> 01:43:49.070]
and they're all dressed in right here.

[01:43:49.210 --> 01:43:50.170]
God knows what they're doing.

[01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:50.670]
Really?

[01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:51.710]
Exactly.

[01:43:52.050 --> 01:43:53.430]
They must begin ready for the celebration

[01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:55.070]
at a nice hockey game.

[01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.810]
You think?

[01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:58.990]
Yeah, we've 200 of them.

[01:43:59.190 --> 01:44:00.190]
They're doing it, huh?

[01:44:00.490 --> 01:44:01.930]
Heading to and wet.

[01:44:02.110 --> 01:44:04.230]
Even that, or they just got the welcoming committee way,

[01:44:04.290 --> 01:44:05.710]
I wait until I get home this afternoon.

[01:44:05.730 --> 01:44:06.370]
That might be it.

[01:44:06.710 --> 01:44:07.350]
Maybe that's it.

[01:44:07.670 --> 01:44:08.910]
OK, I'm ready.

[01:44:09.130 --> 01:44:10.050]
OK, thanks for the good news.

[01:44:10.890 --> 01:44:12.950]
By the way, I'm reading about if you just

[01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:15.030]
cough up to 75 cents, we wouldn't have all

[01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:17.010]
that traffic congestion after the hockey games.

[01:44:17.470 --> 01:44:20.190]
If you just come in off the sawgrass there

[01:44:20.190 --> 01:44:22.870]
and cough up your 75 cents because you don't have to pay

[01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:25.730]
on the way out because we have all this hostility

[01:44:25.730 --> 01:44:28.110]
and people very angry and way too much of the traffic

[01:44:28.110 --> 01:44:30.950]
is going over here and on 136, et cetera, and so on.

[01:44:31.730 --> 01:44:32.290]
Come on.

[01:44:32.410 --> 01:44:33.950]
So you're already paying 120 bucks.

[01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:35.250]
What's another 75 cents?

[01:44:35.370 --> 01:44:39.210]
What things are that going to make for those overpriced

[01:44:39.210 --> 01:44:40.150]
stuff, you know?

[01:44:41.730 --> 01:44:43.830]
Like I said, you're watching it.

[01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:45.910]
You're seeing it unfold right between your eyes.

[01:44:46.050 --> 01:44:47.650]
And I don't care what any of these sports suckers

[01:44:47.650 --> 01:44:48.970]
on this radio station tell you.

[01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:52.170]
They're killing the geese that laid the big fat golden eggs

[01:44:53.650 --> 01:44:55.530]
because they're sucking the blood.

[01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:57.690]
They're sucking air-free ounce of money

[01:44:57.690 --> 01:44:59.690]
and energy out of the so-called fans.

[01:44:59.850 --> 01:45:01.210]
And it's just getting to play.

[01:45:01.290 --> 01:45:03.450]
And they're putting a boring terminal product out there.

[01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:07.470]
That's getting worse and worse and more watered down.

[01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:10.210]
They had a game in Greensboro, North Carolina,

[01:45:10.210 --> 01:45:10.830]
the other night.

[01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:12.330]
Nice going, Gary Batman.

[01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:15.070]
If there were 500 people there, it was a lot.

[01:45:15.450 --> 01:45:17.270]
And then they put in the paper next day, 5,500,

[01:45:17.410 --> 01:45:19.090]
because that's how many season tickets they got sold.

[01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:20.450]
So that's the number of tickets sold.

[01:45:20.970 --> 01:45:22.590]
But the number of bodies in Adirina,

[01:45:22.810 --> 01:45:25.090]
if there were 500 to 1,000, that was a lot.

[01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:27.950]
I have never in my life, I could understand,

[01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:29.030]
was there a snowstorm?

[01:45:29.150 --> 01:45:29.290]
No.

[01:45:29.410 --> 01:45:31.090]
Was there like a natural disaster?

[01:45:31.230 --> 01:45:31.370]
No.

[01:45:31.530 --> 01:45:32.370]
Were having a war?

[01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.670]
No.

[01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:36.110]
I've never seen a professional sporting event

[01:45:36.110 --> 01:45:38.710]
of any kind anywhere in the US of A,

[01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:40.390]
with so few people in there.

[01:45:41.130 --> 01:45:41.610]
A handful.

[01:45:43.190 --> 01:45:45.370]
But we're spending millions of dollars.

[01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:46.130]
Well, guess what?

[01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:47.850]
People don't give a crap anymore, OK?

[01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:49.070]
Because we've been fed enough.

[01:45:49.210 --> 01:45:50.570]
We've been labeled enough bull crap.

[01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:54.130]
And you can only squeeze so much blood out of a rocket.

[01:45:54.130 --> 01:45:56.550]
And finally, even the most, the easiest of people

[01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:58.750]
finally starts saying, no, no thanks.

[01:46:01.150 --> 01:46:06.090]
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

[01:46:06.090 --> 01:46:07.050]
60, WQM.

[01:46:07.230 --> 01:46:09.230]
I haven't even mentioned this thing about the Republican

[01:46:09.230 --> 01:46:11.370]
candidate in Tennessee who shot and killed his opponent.

[01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:14.330]
That's one good way to make sure you don't lose the election.

[01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:17.670]
Connie Burst wasn't the kind of politician who made enemies.

[01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:20.470]
The courtly 58 year old Tennessee State Senator

[01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:22.110]
would slap his hogs early each morning

[01:46:22.110 --> 01:46:24.410]
before driving his pickup to the capital of Nashville.

[01:46:25.130 --> 01:46:26.510]
On weekends, he walked door to door

[01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:28.450]
and rural Monterey checking in O'onnorville

[01:46:28.450 --> 01:46:29.470]
posted in the winter to make sure

[01:46:29.470 --> 01:46:30.230]
their heat was working.

[01:46:30.650 --> 01:46:32.170]
A popular Democrat, his reelection

[01:46:32.170 --> 01:46:34.070]
seemed certain until last week, when

[01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:35.430]
Burst was found shot and dead

[01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:37.570]
and in his truck near the pumpkin patch.

[01:46:38.570 --> 01:46:40.190]
Later in the week, police met in a rest

[01:46:40.190 --> 01:46:42.150]
34 year old Byron Lupert,

[01:46:42.230 --> 01:46:43.290]
Burst's Republican opponent.

[01:46:44.590 --> 01:46:46.010]
Lupert was something of a carpet bag

[01:46:46.010 --> 01:46:47.670]
he dropped out of West Point after an e-inch

[01:46:47.670 --> 01:46:48.510]
read and moved to Georgia.

[01:46:48.970 --> 01:46:50.050]
He spent some time in Puerto Rico

[01:46:50.050 --> 01:46:51.530]
before making his way back to Tennessee.

[01:46:52.010 --> 01:46:54.410]
It didn't take long for him to run a follow of the law.

[01:46:54.770 --> 01:46:56.030]
Lupert was scheduled to go on trial

[01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:57.930]
on December for abuse of office and theft.

[01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:59.730]
Prosecutor Chisha had come to Miami.

[01:47:00.250 --> 01:47:02.050]
Prosecutor Saye offered tax breaks to land

[01:47:02.050 --> 01:47:04.170]
and developers in exchange for campaign contributions.

[01:47:04.730 --> 01:47:06.990]
And in a meet my family campaign ad,

[01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:08.910]
Lupert tried to pass office girlfriend,

[01:47:09.150 --> 01:47:10.710]
Tariq Guest, as his wife.

[01:47:11.790 --> 01:47:13.710]
Guest has since charged Lupert with rape,

[01:47:14.150 --> 01:47:16.550]
same as Salt-produced a child who was born last August.

[01:47:17.370 --> 01:47:21.650]
She is demanding $1.2 million in damages in Tennessee.

[01:47:21.790 --> 01:47:23.270]
That's the American fucking wing.

[01:47:23.650 --> 01:47:24.150]
There you go.

[01:47:25.150 --> 01:47:26.610]
Like I said, he ain't gonna lose that election

[01:47:26.610 --> 01:47:27.030]
a bad guy.

[01:47:28.290 --> 01:47:28.990]
Where are we going?

[01:47:29.110 --> 01:47:30.450]
Here's a mobile impombie, Chilla.

[01:47:31.010 --> 01:47:31.790]
Hey, Neil, good afternoon.

[01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:32.870]
Yes, sir. Good evening.

[01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:35.250]
So I can't wait to see Stevie Weiserman play tonight.

[01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:35.590]
Yeah.

[01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:37.250]
And good thing they really shut up those line

[01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:38.330]
and they had that new lineup now

[01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:39.290]
that red wings on the internet.

[01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:39.470]
Why?

[01:47:41.850 --> 01:47:41.850]

[01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:43.310]
So the real smoke up,

[01:47:43.610 --> 01:47:45.470]
well in the stadium for the arena tonight

[01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:46.230]
for the first time.

[01:47:46.450 --> 01:47:46.590]
Yeah.

[01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:48.270]
We'll tell him the door's open and to get him there.

[01:47:48.450 --> 01:47:49.070]
Six PM.

[01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:49.830]
There you go.

[01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.570]
He could throw it.

[01:47:51.370 --> 01:47:53.550]
I mean, I'm not saying the food is real, real bad.

[01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:55.670]
I mean, it's okay for arena food,

[01:47:55.670 --> 01:47:57.790]
but it's very, very overpriced.

[01:47:57.810 --> 01:47:58.610]
It's all overpriced.

[01:47:58.810 --> 01:47:59.030]
Yeah.

[01:47:59.550 --> 01:48:01.030]
And you know, who real say this?

[01:48:01.190 --> 01:48:02.510]
I don't mind the money they were fine.

[01:48:02.610 --> 01:48:03.690]
I was complaining about.

[01:48:04.170 --> 01:48:05.170]
As though his ass from his elbow,

[01:48:05.170 --> 01:48:07.450]
Volvio has your cooling made 16 saves.

[01:48:07.690 --> 01:48:08.150]
Yet's true.

[01:48:08.230 --> 01:48:09.510]
The Rangers only had 16 shots,

[01:48:09.590 --> 01:48:11.830]
but I'd say at least half of those saves were spectacular.

[01:48:12.150 --> 01:48:13.910]
And he and Richter played out of their minds.

[01:48:14.110 --> 01:48:16.170]
And for a squalless tie, it was a phenomenal game.

[01:48:16.170 --> 01:48:17.210]
It was very entertaining, sir.

[01:48:17.690 --> 01:48:18.870]
Neil Dezle ate the watch.

[01:48:18.990 --> 01:48:20.130]
I talked to you about in Cannes and Channel 9

[01:48:20.130 --> 01:48:20.510]
and Detroit.

[01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:21.770]
I have a little hot night.

[01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:22.750]
I can't not see music.

[01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:24.650]
Hockey night in Cannes.

[01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:27.330]
Even though it's not even Boston anymore.

[01:48:27.610 --> 01:48:27.870]
Yeah.

[01:48:27.870 --> 01:48:30.170]
Well, you know something they've seen it since.

[01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:31.330]
Nah, that's about it.

[01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:33.130]
The music is pretty much the same.

[01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:34.830]
Can I hear it's a bike line?

[01:48:35.090 --> 01:48:35.650]
I'll be here there.

[01:48:36.610 --> 01:48:39.290]
It's a dumpster here in my maple leaf thing on, okay?

[01:48:39.790 --> 01:48:40.730]
It's a hockey knife.

[01:48:40.930 --> 01:48:41.690]
He's a fun type phone.

[01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:42.470]
What's he got here?

[01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:43.970]
He's a...

[01:48:43.970 --> 01:48:45.470]
What brought to you that I'd moaned?

[01:48:45.490 --> 01:48:47.350]
It's a lot bad hockey night in Cannes and now.

[01:48:47.710 --> 01:48:48.390]
It's a little great.

[01:48:49.930 --> 01:48:52.310]
Oh, in fact, what was gone, Cherry-san?

[01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:55.230]
About hockey night in Cannes and the other night?

[01:48:55.290 --> 01:48:55.970]
You're sitting up, please.

[01:48:56.050 --> 01:48:56.850]
You're going to sit up, straight up.

[01:48:57.010 --> 01:48:57.130]
Yeah.

[01:48:57.130 --> 01:48:58.070]
Christian, yeah.

[01:48:58.190 --> 01:48:58.770]
We're always away.

[01:48:59.270 --> 01:49:01.290]
Hey, are we going to sit down?

[01:49:01.630 --> 01:49:02.730]
What the fuck is this?

[01:49:02.930 --> 01:49:03.950]
Why are we doing this?

[01:49:04.210 --> 01:49:04.650]
Fucking shit.

[01:49:05.130 --> 01:49:05.490]
Where are we?

[01:49:05.630 --> 01:49:06.490]
We're going back to that.

[01:49:06.810 --> 01:49:07.750]
Convulsion, again, eh?

[01:49:08.010 --> 01:49:10.590]
Squeeze from coach's corner and after everything else.

[01:49:10.970 --> 01:49:12.330]
It's been taken care of.

[01:49:13.170 --> 01:49:14.670]
They're both fucking vulc-

[01:49:14.670 --> 01:49:15.270]
All right.

[01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:18.170]
23 till 2 at 5, 6, 2, it's a win.

[01:49:18.170 --> 01:49:18.970]
They will be on a 2.

[01:49:19.110 --> 01:49:20.710]
Of course, 7 o'clock, 6 o'clock,

[01:49:20.770 --> 01:49:22.570]
we got the booster for one hour and then 7 o'clock

[01:49:22.570 --> 01:49:23.030]
to pregame.

[01:49:23.370 --> 01:49:25.010]
Path is on the Detroit Red Wings.

[01:49:25.010 --> 01:49:26.970]
Two times stand in the cup defending champions

[01:49:26.970 --> 01:49:30.930]
with end Sir Gai Fedorov and all these other guys.

[01:49:32.290 --> 01:49:33.310]
What a year they got to.

[01:49:33.390 --> 01:49:34.430]
This one and they got that one.

[01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:35.830]
I mean, they got so many great players on it.

[01:49:35.950 --> 01:49:36.750]
Team that it's disgusting.

[01:49:36.750 --> 01:49:37.930]
OK, Brendan Shanahan.

[01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:40.630]
I wonder whose wife he's a OK, 28.

[01:49:41.230 --> 01:49:42.610]
Anyway, he hasn't appeared.

[01:49:43.210 --> 01:49:44.890]
B3 at 5, 60 WDQM.

[01:49:44.970 --> 01:49:47.730]
So anyway, a little correction on the TV thing on whanny

[01:49:47.730 --> 01:49:48.670]
for the four people.

[01:49:49.610 --> 01:49:51.110]
And I wonder if you're going to be doing the show.

[01:49:51.210 --> 01:49:52.450]
I'll be on vacation and after that,

[01:49:52.450 --> 01:49:54.110]
they're just to take it off to go get a real job.

[01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:56.550]
But anyway, they'll be showing reruns for a period.

[01:49:56.670 --> 01:49:57.890]
Maybe forever, who knows?

[01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:59.210]
Maybe they'll just out of spite.

[01:49:59.230 --> 01:50:00.370]
They'll keep putting the reruns out there

[01:50:00.370 --> 01:50:01.490]
as long as they have to pay us.

[01:50:02.270 --> 01:50:04.730]
To like next May or when June or whenever it is.

[01:50:05.150 --> 01:50:06.830]
So anyway, speaking of that, if I can hold it,

[01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:07.690]
can we get this on here?

[01:50:07.770 --> 01:50:09.310]
Can we get a shot on the TV thing tonight?

[01:50:09.570 --> 01:50:09.910]
The books?

[01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:11.310]
I'll probably not.

[01:50:11.410 --> 01:50:12.310]
That would take too much editing.

[01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:14.370]
And you like those hockey tickets, Dave?

[01:50:15.330 --> 01:50:17.250]
So anyway, these are the two books you must go out.

[01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:18.030]
I mean, at all for it.

[01:50:18.090 --> 01:50:19.350]
She's got all the Housewives of America,

[01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:22.970]
Bioneys, Syrup, E. Crapie, feel good horse ball books.

[01:50:23.710 --> 01:50:26.070]
Lost rights, the destruction of American books.

[01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:28.010]
You'll be spitting mad.

[01:50:28.090 --> 01:50:30.490]
You might actually develop your brain a little bit.

[01:50:31.190 --> 01:50:33.230]
And pros and cons, criminals who play Asian

[01:50:33.230 --> 01:50:35.010]
by Jeff Benedict and Don Yeager

[01:50:35.010 --> 01:50:36.730]
in hardcover just out, great book.

[01:50:37.250 --> 01:50:38.750]
Oh, look, there's Lamar Thomas,

[01:50:38.930 --> 01:50:40.050]
Jeremy, and to push again on the back.

[01:50:40.370 --> 01:50:40.670]
Sayin'

[01:50:40.710 --> 01:50:41.270]
Oh God!

[01:50:42.610 --> 01:50:43.150]
Here's Miami.

[01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.530]
Hello.

[01:50:45.050 --> 01:50:45.510]
Miami.

[01:50:45.850 --> 01:50:46.350]
Hello, Neil.

[01:50:46.510 --> 01:50:46.810]
Yes, sir.

[01:50:47.190 --> 01:50:47.770]
Hi, Neil.

[01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:49.630]
I'm a Julio from Columbia.

[01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:51.390]
It's a new turn so it's on the light.

[01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:54.950]
And exactly, right before the guard gate,

[01:50:55.130 --> 01:50:57.610]
he stops him and asks him for his license, whatever.

[01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:59.710]
Meanwhile, I'm out with my friends that night

[01:50:59.710 --> 01:51:02.850]
and I'm coming home, we see like five police cars.

[01:51:03.550 --> 01:51:05.150]
And when we see that, that is my son,

[01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:07.190]
like a father, I'm concerned and I stop.

[01:51:07.670 --> 01:51:08.770]
And I asked one of the officers,

[01:51:08.770 --> 01:51:10.330]
and he said, well, I'm just here as a backup.

[01:51:10.670 --> 01:51:11.590]
So I'm so stopped him.

[01:51:11.670 --> 01:51:13.470]
And there was like five police officers laughing

[01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:14.510]
and carrying on in the back.

[01:51:15.050 --> 01:51:16.890]
I started walking towards him on one of them,

[01:51:16.930 --> 01:51:17.810]
which has come to me,

[01:51:18.370 --> 01:51:19.550]
flash lighting my face.

[01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:21.550]
This was not pertinent to you leaving.

[01:51:21.690 --> 01:51:23.870]
And I identified myself as a father

[01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:24.890]
and I said, what's going on?

[01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:27.170]
A lot of police cars here, we live here.

[01:51:27.790 --> 01:51:29.150]
If I have to tell you one more time,

[01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:30.270]
I'm gonna arrest you and I say,

[01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.490]
what?

[01:51:30.770 --> 01:51:32.350]
This is my son, what do you do?

[01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:33.550]
Stop him, do something wrong?

[01:51:33.810 --> 01:51:35.010]
Why did they stop him?

[01:51:35.210 --> 01:51:37.390]
Well, supposedly for transvesting,

[01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:39.690]
transvesting, when my son identified himself

[01:51:39.690 --> 01:51:42.010]
as he I'm coming from work or later.

[01:51:42.570 --> 01:51:45.090]
And then my son says like four or five more cars showed up

[01:51:45.090 --> 01:51:45.470]
after that.

[01:51:46.090 --> 01:51:47.530]
So anyways, I say, well, I'm on.

[01:51:47.530 --> 01:51:49.290]
I'll tell you what, I stopped you for a later

[01:51:49.770 --> 01:51:52.550]
with all my buddies show up and we make a wish on here.

[01:51:52.630 --> 01:51:53.850]
He told him, well, when my son said,

[01:51:53.850 --> 01:51:55.250]
I wasn't transvesting, I just got off

[01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:56.970]
of I-75 and coming home from work.

[01:51:57.150 --> 01:51:57.330]
Yeah.

[01:51:57.630 --> 01:51:58.790]
And he said, well, I'll tell you what,

[01:51:58.810 --> 01:51:59.710]
I stopped you for a later.

[01:52:00.290 --> 01:52:02.050]
And he walked towards the back when I moved up

[01:52:02.690 --> 01:52:04.350]
and I'm like, well, anyways,

[01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:08.250]
when I say, well, what's going is a turn around,

[01:52:08.330 --> 01:52:08.930]
you're under arrest.

[01:52:09.710 --> 01:52:11.150]
I say, what are you talking about?

[01:52:11.370 --> 01:52:12.110]
Under arrest for what?

[01:52:12.250 --> 01:52:12.770]
I ask you a question.

[01:52:13.150 --> 01:52:15.210]
I ask you a question and he goes, just turn around

[01:52:15.210 --> 01:52:16.630]
and I put my hands up in this rail.

[01:52:16.630 --> 01:52:19.950]
He starts searching me and then he gives me a few elbows

[01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:23.050]
to my kidneys and a few punches and that's not necessary.

[01:52:23.250 --> 01:52:23.490]
Oh, you were normal.

[01:52:23.490 --> 01:52:25.010]
That's the American fucking way.

[01:52:25.090 --> 01:52:25.390]
Yeah.

[01:52:25.650 --> 01:52:26.910]
I say, that's not necessary.

[01:52:27.570 --> 01:52:29.530]
And he says, oh, it's unnecessary.

[01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:30.470]
He's resuscitating me.

[01:52:30.610 --> 01:52:31.550]
Let's take him down next thing.

[01:52:31.630 --> 01:52:32.970]
I know I got three or four of them.

[01:52:33.130 --> 01:52:34.750]
Not in my neck, but I'm just wondering.

[01:52:35.130 --> 01:52:36.050]
So what was the upshot of this?

[01:52:36.210 --> 01:52:37.570]
How much of a lawsuit are you following?

[01:52:37.730 --> 01:52:39.250]
Well, you know, it's still pending.

[01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:40.670]
That's what I know their names.

[01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:41.710]
I don't want to say their names.

[01:52:41.730 --> 01:52:42.990]
I don't want the names, but I mean,

[01:52:43.010 --> 01:52:44.850]
what was the reason they eventually said

[01:52:44.850 --> 01:52:45.810]
that they stopped you?

[01:52:46.510 --> 01:52:47.650]
Abstructional for my son.

[01:52:47.730 --> 01:52:48.030]
Yeah.

[01:52:48.250 --> 01:52:51.730]
They said he was playing the musical on a work truck

[01:52:51.730 --> 01:52:54.790]
and a little tiny work truck with the...

[01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:57.070]
So in other words, it took five cops to come in

[01:52:57.070 --> 01:52:59.590]
in Pemberer Pine because he allegedly was playing

[01:52:59.590 --> 01:53:02.170]
the music to love and they had a slap you in jail.

[01:53:02.450 --> 01:53:04.850]
They put me in jail, bruised me up pretty bad.

[01:53:06.010 --> 01:53:08.390]
And the supervisor, and then when I went to the

[01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:09.650]
mechanical plane and said, well, you want to speak

[01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:11.590]
to the supervisor and when I asked you the supervisor,

[01:53:11.590 --> 01:53:13.830]
he superrides to the one who almost snapped my neck off

[01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:14.230]
that night.

[01:53:14.230 --> 01:53:15.730]
No, no, no, that's okay.

[01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:17.930]
I said, someone else will get in touch with you guys.

[01:53:18.290 --> 01:53:20.850]
So I just went and left and it's in process.

[01:53:21.070 --> 01:53:21.950]
I have to go...

[01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:23.290]
Fransman, false arrest.

[01:53:23.850 --> 01:53:25.470]
Harassment, I sue the pants off of them.

[01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:27.770]
And I have a brother and a sister there

[01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:29.790]
who worked for the Department of Justice with IMS.

[01:53:30.670 --> 01:53:32.630]
And I was real angry once.

[01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:34.110]
They threw me on the ground and bruised me up.

[01:53:34.230 --> 01:53:36.690]
And I was at this one officer wearing...

[01:53:36.690 --> 01:53:38.130]
You know, F and trouble, this and this.

[01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:39.310]
And he was, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:53:39.690 --> 01:53:42.050]
And when they took me to jail, they take my record.

[01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:43.130]
It's impeccable.

[01:53:43.130 --> 01:53:46.110]
And they start, I'm trying to do my job and you can't say,

[01:53:46.210 --> 01:53:46.590]
oh, that was...

[01:53:46.590 --> 01:53:48.770]
That's a little more for me, it's for my job, above my side.

[01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:50.770]
I just try to do a job, Hasel Crombeens.

[01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:52.090]
That's the American way.

[01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:53.310]
And a good luck pal.

[01:53:53.470 --> 01:53:53.910]
Okay, but...

[01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:54.430]
To their ass.

[01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.230]
All right.

[01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:56.610]
Wow.

[01:53:57.450 --> 01:53:57.650]
Hell.

[01:53:58.030 --> 01:53:59.650]
I should have really, really happy.

[01:53:59.830 --> 01:54:01.030]
What are those on your feet, shoes?

[01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.610]
What else?

[01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:03.650]
S, O, C, K, F.

[01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:06.010]
You just said kiss my f***ing in, Cassini.

[01:54:06.230 --> 01:54:06.950]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:54:07.170 --> 01:54:07.730]
Don't be sorry.

[01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:08.950]
Hey, what's that around your waist?

[01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:09.650]
About...

[01:54:09.650 --> 01:54:10.030]
Spell it.

[01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.710]
E, E, L, T.

[01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:12.870]
You just told someone to f*** off.

[01:54:12.870 --> 01:54:13.550]
In Zulu.

[01:54:13.730 --> 01:54:14.150]
Oh, my.

[01:54:14.530 --> 01:54:16.250]
And that's just one of the many techniques you'll learn

[01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:18.530]
with the National Profanix Language Couset Program.

[01:54:18.930 --> 01:54:21.450]
National Profanix can have you cursing in Spanish, French,

[01:54:21.810 --> 01:54:23.590]
Italian, German, and a host of other languages

[01:54:23.590 --> 01:54:25.070]
in just a few weeks.

[01:54:25.490 --> 01:54:25.850]
So call.

[01:54:26.150 --> 01:54:27.090]
1-800-

[01:54:27.090 --> 01:54:28.490]
F*** you today.

[01:54:28.890 --> 01:54:30.770]
Because the most important thing you'll need to know

[01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:33.150]
about other cultures is how to tell somebody off.

[01:54:33.230 --> 01:54:33.790]
Hey, buddy.

[01:54:34.210 --> 01:54:35.410]
S, O, C, K, F.

[01:54:35.630 --> 01:54:36.630]
It's a 155.

[01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:38.090]
By the way, if you look up the word useless

[01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:40.510]
in Webster's dictionary, you'll see Norma Ken's picture next to it.

[01:54:40.710 --> 01:54:42.470]
But anyway, don't forget,

[01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:45.010]
at Center One, this Saturday at Ben and Jerry's Navature,

[01:54:45.150 --> 01:54:47.930]
come on by, have some fish food, some New York Super Fudge,

[01:54:48.130 --> 01:54:50.350]
chunk, some chocolate cherry garcia, frozen yogurt,

[01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:51.010]
whatever you like.

[01:54:51.630 --> 01:54:53.170]
And pick up your best and yield C.E.s

[01:54:53.170 --> 01:54:54.390]
and T-shirts, and so on.

[01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:56.090]
We'll have our DNA chip here, if any.

[01:54:56.970 --> 01:54:58.770]
We'll have our buttons and the stickers

[01:54:58.770 --> 01:55:00.730]
and postage and all kinds of good stuff to give to you.

[01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:02.930]
It'll be interesting to see how many balls

[01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:04.750]
the people we have out there who have the guts

[01:55:04.750 --> 01:55:06.330]
since we always read that thing earlier

[01:55:06.330 --> 01:55:07.990]
at the beginning of the show today about how,

[01:55:08.190 --> 01:55:09.330]
oh, you can't say you're an atheist

[01:55:09.330 --> 01:55:10.950]
or not a religion in America.

[01:55:11.710 --> 01:55:13.990]
You can't say you're not one of the religious assholes

[01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:16.530]
because then they all would have said, look down

[01:55:16.530 --> 01:55:17.490]
and it was like, are you crazy?

[01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:19.010]
That's the American fucking way.

[01:55:19.070 --> 01:55:19.450]
That's right.

[01:55:20.210 --> 01:55:21.330]
Here's plantation, hello.

[01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.970]
Maybe I'll, how you doing, the way?

[01:55:22.970 --> 01:55:23.330]
Okay, sir.

[01:55:23.810 --> 01:55:24.750]
You know, when you spell useless,

[01:55:24.930 --> 01:55:27.030]
you might as well spell Adam Kershner, because.

[01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.570]
Okay, great.

[01:55:27.850 --> 01:55:29.990]
Oh, that's the asshole that's on the thing with Adam,

[01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:32.270]
or maybe, okay, I just don't want to wait by the way.

[01:55:32.630 --> 01:55:33.890]
Which is going away by the way.

[01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:35.510]
Yeah, that's going to be gone anyway, by the way.

[01:55:35.630 --> 01:55:37.010]
But I noticed a sock over the phone

[01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:38.190]
and you're still the same asshole,

[01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:39.490]
that's the second one today.

[01:55:40.210 --> 01:55:41.030]
Second one today.

[01:55:41.290 --> 01:55:42.390]
This guy who spends all this time

[01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:43.890]
putt whacking back and forth with Adam

[01:55:43.890 --> 01:55:46.210]
on our chat room there on the Anil God.com,

[01:55:46.350 --> 01:55:48.090]
which that'll be forgotten very, very soon.

[01:55:48.670 --> 01:55:50.630]
Adam wants a God damn place to play with his boyfriend.

[01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:52.510]
Let him do it on Rick and Suss website,

[01:55:52.510 --> 01:55:53.570]
or some other God damn place.

[01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:55.390]
We don't have time for a bull crap, okay?

[01:55:55.610 --> 01:55:57.810]
Including you, sir, with a sock over.

[01:55:57.950 --> 01:56:00.190]
It's either a sock over with plus or we've got 400 pounds

[01:56:00.190 --> 01:56:02.350]
of it is a mouth, which I think is more likely.

[01:56:03.130 --> 01:56:04.350]
Here's a lady in Miami, hello.

[01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:07.150]
Hello.

[01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:09.610]
She's squealing.

[01:56:09.730 --> 01:56:10.210]
Hey, Bill.

[01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:11.030]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:56:11.110 --> 01:56:11.490]
How you doing?

[01:56:11.690 --> 01:56:12.310]
Why are you squealing?

[01:56:12.630 --> 01:56:14.590]
Because I was on the other line, I have two phones.

[01:56:14.730 --> 01:56:15.070]
Oh, okay.

[01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:16.730]
So how's everything going?

[01:56:16.890 --> 01:56:17.030]
Great.

[01:56:17.590 --> 01:56:19.870]
I just want to know, Steve Goldstein's girlfriend,

[01:56:20.170 --> 01:56:21.630]
why do you always make front of them?

[01:56:22.050 --> 01:56:23.310]
Your Steve Goldstein's girlfriend?

[01:56:23.330 --> 01:56:23.570]
Yeah.

[01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:27.090]
It's because you say you make more money for the new.

[01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:28.750]
He makes more money than I do?

[01:56:28.850 --> 01:56:29.110]
Yeah.

[01:56:29.690 --> 01:56:30.590]
Yeah, you sure?

[01:56:31.110 --> 01:56:32.850]
Also, by the way, I want to tell you something.

[01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:34.250]
They laugh there in this building.

[01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:35.750]
The building may crumble.

[01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:39.330]
The building may fall from the fact that I have no problem

[01:56:39.330 --> 01:56:39.670]
with Geltie.

[01:56:39.670 --> 01:56:41.350]
Other than the fact he sounds like a 10-year-old kid.

[01:56:41.630 --> 01:56:43.710]
Does he also have the penis-assize of a 10-year-old child?

[01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:44.550]
Oh, he's got that thing.

[01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:45.550]
Oh, that's good.

[01:56:45.630 --> 01:56:46.150]
Okay, great.

[01:56:47.730 --> 01:56:49.730]
We just discovered Geltie's got a big one.

[01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:50.730]
Hey, oh, it's you.

[01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:51.210]
I don't know.

[01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.390]
Woo.

[01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:53.450]
Have you, Dutie?

[01:56:53.670 --> 01:56:55.070]
He's making a lot more money.

[01:56:55.210 --> 01:56:55.950]
Okay, Geltie.

[01:56:56.050 --> 01:56:56.430]
Hold me for a second.

[01:56:56.490 --> 01:56:57.130]
Goldie's got money.

[01:56:57.290 --> 01:56:59.330]
Geltie, I'm a little short this week and more ways than one.

[01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.830]
What a joke.

[01:57:02.110 --> 01:57:03.290]
I told you, put up calls.

[01:57:03.390 --> 01:57:05.050]
She's like, well, she's squealing in the back right.

[01:57:05.050 --> 01:57:06.410]
She's starting to make squealing sound.

[01:57:06.570 --> 01:57:07.670]
Maybe that's what maybe it rubs off.

[01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:08.970]
Maybe that's what he started squealing.

[01:57:11.070 --> 01:57:12.430]
There's no problem with Geltie.

[01:57:12.590 --> 01:57:14.570]
There's just one little thing he does in belong

[01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:16.770]
on the skinnier, okay?

[01:57:16.850 --> 01:57:17.330]
That's all.

[01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:19.010]
That's the only problem we got with Geltie.

[01:57:19.570 --> 01:57:21.410]
Besides the fact that he's a little ass-ducker.

[01:57:22.170 --> 01:57:23.470]
And then he's on the payroll with Wayne.

[01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:24.910]
And he's got no credibility whatsoever.

[01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:27.350]
And got a squeaky voice, like a five-year-old child.

[01:57:27.650 --> 01:57:29.790]
Other than that, we have no problem with Geltie.

[01:57:31.150 --> 01:57:32.130]
Here's a lady in Boka.

[01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.470]
Hello.

[01:57:33.150 --> 01:57:33.470]
Hey, Neil.

[01:57:33.730 --> 01:57:34.170]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:57:34.690 --> 01:57:36.750]
Remember I called Gelt today about doing an interview

[01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:37.610]
with Mickey Rourke?

[01:57:38.490 --> 01:57:38.710]
Yeah.

[01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:40.930]
Well, you said you'd do a little bit on him today.

[01:57:41.550 --> 01:57:42.290]
And I didn't hear it yet.

[01:57:42.690 --> 01:57:43.730]
You didn't hear Mickey Rourke?

[01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:45.770]
I said, come over here.

[01:57:45.930 --> 01:57:47.330]
You're stuck around knocking you out.

[01:57:47.450 --> 01:57:48.150]
That's what I said.

[01:57:48.490 --> 01:57:49.330]
Yeah, anything else, Mickey?

[01:57:49.450 --> 01:57:52.550]
Officer Prince wanted to get his rock saw.

[01:57:52.810 --> 01:57:54.110]
Yeah, I've got a lot of friends.

[01:57:54.110 --> 01:57:55.550]
They're on the police force here.

[01:57:56.010 --> 01:57:58.510]
That incomprinentiality have told me

[01:57:58.930 --> 01:58:01.090]
how much of an asshole Prince is.

[01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:02.150]
Oh, right.

[01:58:02.150 --> 01:58:04.650]
I think that's the officer, not the artist formerly known as.

[01:58:05.110 --> 01:58:05.470]
There you go.

[01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:06.410]
There's Mickey Rourke.

[01:58:06.490 --> 01:58:06.810]
Oh!

[01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:08.530]
Yeah, they must be really desperate.

[01:58:08.650 --> 01:58:11.210]
He's got to have her painting and try to get him on his show.

[01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:12.310]
We don't do celebrities.

[01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:14.530]
Even real ones, OK, much less Mickey Rourke.

[01:58:14.670 --> 01:58:15.970]
And Kim Basinger says he smells bad.

[01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:16.930]
Oh, geez.

[01:58:17.450 --> 01:58:17.810]
Scombat.

[01:58:18.570 --> 01:58:21.510]
I mean, even in his old state now, Stephen Barrer,

[01:58:21.710 --> 01:58:23.810]
a far more appealing man, even at birth, Mickey Rourke

[01:58:23.810 --> 01:58:24.330]
was a disgusting.

[01:58:24.970 --> 01:58:25.950]
Here's a mobile in Naples.

[01:58:26.110 --> 01:58:26.270]
Hello.

[01:58:27.110 --> 01:58:27.690]
Hey, Neil.

[01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:28.190]
Yes, sir.

[01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:30.150]
Going back to that police state issue.

[01:58:30.450 --> 01:58:30.610]
Yeah.

[01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:33.110]
This happened to me back when I lived in Miami.

[01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:34.190]
I was 18 years old.

[01:58:34.410 --> 01:58:36.470]
We got out of the movie theater of me and my friend.

[01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.870]

[01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:38.250]
And so we're walking home.

[01:58:38.330 --> 01:58:40.610]
We cut through this shortcut to get home.

[01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:42.590]
We got stopped by the police walking.

[01:58:42.810 --> 01:58:43.950]
A mayster on the shortcut, yeah.

[01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:47.330]
And no, actually, it was behind the shopping center.

[01:58:47.530 --> 01:58:48.170]
We were walking behind.

[01:58:48.210 --> 01:58:49.530]
That was in the worst lawns, man.

[01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:51.250]
You're in big trouble behind the shopping center.

[01:58:51.450 --> 01:58:54.410]
And they erect us because they said that we were,

[01:58:55.110 --> 01:58:57.510]
they had gotten calls of people breaking in the houses

[01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:58.010]
around there.

[01:58:58.010 --> 01:59:00.570]
And we had our movie stub tickets and everything in our hand.

[01:59:00.650 --> 01:59:01.730]
You had your stub in your hand, yeah.

[01:59:01.770 --> 01:59:02.530]
Maybe that was the problem.

[01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:06.230]
And they showed like five police cars showed up.

[01:59:08.070 --> 01:59:10.550]
And they said, no, they had calls

[01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:12.250]
of people breaking in the houses around there.

[01:59:12.330 --> 01:59:14.850]
And I told the guy, look, we just got out of the movie theater.

[01:59:15.230 --> 01:59:16.630]
You bring the people that said that we've

[01:59:16.630 --> 01:59:18.750]
been breaking in their houses and have my dinner find.

[01:59:18.890 --> 01:59:19.070]
Right.

[01:59:19.410 --> 01:59:21.570]
And they got to tell me, one of the police officers goes,

[01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:23.790]
if you don't shut up, you're going to beat you off this

[01:59:23.790 --> 01:59:24.310]
and this and this.

[01:59:24.670 --> 01:59:25.450]
So I'd be quiet.

[01:59:25.590 --> 01:59:26.390]
They took us to jail.

[01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:28.670]
My parents had to come bail me out of jail.

[01:59:29.070 --> 01:59:32.030]
To this stage, you know, I have a loitering and prowling

[01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:34.770]
of misdemeanor arrest on my record.

[01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:35.130]
Nice.

[01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:37.490]
Those are that isn't that nice unbelievable.

[01:59:38.030 --> 01:59:39.810]
The only thing I've ever done in my life

[01:59:39.810 --> 01:59:41.110]
that I've ever been arrested for.

[01:59:41.250 --> 01:59:43.750]
Go go to Shoeifeld when they go to the theater.

[01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:45.850]
When in doubt, don't show understabbed.

[01:59:45.850 --> 01:59:48.010]
Another question is there a 1-800 number

[01:59:48.010 --> 01:59:50.990]
I can call where I can order best of Neil

[01:59:50.990 --> 01:59:53.750]
or do I have to go to Miami and take it off.

[01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:55.270]
It's not 890-954.

[01:59:55.830 --> 01:59:56.630]
I'm in Brown right?

[01:59:56.850 --> 01:59:57.530]
No, I'm in Naples.

[01:59:58.530 --> 01:59:59.170]
OK, 954.

[01:59:59.310 --> 02:00:00.070]
You can afford it.

[02:00:01.130 --> 02:00:01.450]
563.

[02:00:02.210 --> 02:00:02.490]
OK.

[02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.350]
3600.

[02:00:03.650 --> 02:00:04.070]
All right.

[02:00:04.210 --> 02:00:04.790]
OK, thanks, pal.

[02:00:05.050 --> 02:00:05.210]
All right.

[02:00:05.330 --> 02:00:05.850]
Note to it again.

[02:00:06.150 --> 02:00:07.070]
Note to show them your stuff.

[02:00:07.390 --> 02:00:08.910]
OK, well, at the time, thanks coming up next

[02:00:08.910 --> 02:00:10.010]
from the show to the stage 2.

[02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:11.210]
We got the books to be fixed.

[02:00:11.530 --> 02:00:12.330]
Panthers tonight, boy.

[02:00:12.450 --> 02:00:14.010]
Let's just score gold tonight, at least one.
