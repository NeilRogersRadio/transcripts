[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320]
Dude, like get into the show.

[00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.900]
I have to put this point.

[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.360]
Because I thought it was pretty shocking when the guy called and asked his Roger Marist still alive.

[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.820]
But what, the tag on the end of that spot that we just had, who was that?

[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.660]
Lenny.

[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.900]
Lenny what? Lenny Kravitz?

[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.020]
Who, who was that?

[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.880]
Lenny what?

[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.320]
Martez.

[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.380]
Well, what is that?

[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.660]
Is it animal?

[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.520]
Vegetable?

[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.020]
Oh my God.

[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.120]
I wanted to give you the real thing, Danielle.

[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.140]
Here, what, it's Pato 2 at 5.60 WQM. Happy Tuesday.

[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.100]
That's right. We're almost there. We're almost a Labor Day.

[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.640]
We're hanging on by our thumbnails. I'm going to tell you something.

[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.540]
I'm going to start listening to the morning show with the whole different, which I don't listen to with anyway, as little as I can.

[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.840]
But with a whole different attitude.

[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.860]
Because I now realize what are, what their stations basically all about.

[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.680]
And that is people talking about stuff that they have no idea what they're talking about.

[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:06.000]
People talking about sports, loud and shrill, especially Geldy, talking about right where he wouldn't know Roger Maris, if the ghost or Roger Maris walked in right now, he wouldn't know him.

[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.780]
But that guy who sounded old enough to know what Mathusla calling and asking is Roger Maris still alive.

[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.080]
This is our, this is our sports discussion in South Florida.

[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.080]
And by the way, Andrew Steen, it sounds Jewish to me, don't you?

[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.480]
Oh, Andrew Steen.

[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.480]
DeFos, I think too much Viagra is what's getting to DeFos.

[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.120]
It's a good lesson for all you guys out there. Viagra is great in like small amounts.

[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.000]
Don't overdo it because DeFo obviously is crumbling under the pressure of that drug.

[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.760]
Because he's all psychotic that I ripped him in ass yesterday for ping on Mark McWarris parade.

[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.180]
And I take nothing back that I said.

[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.800]
And you'll notice that if you scour the sports pages, nobody is writing about this thing anymore because those people who understand this is not something.

[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.960]
And this morning, DeFos carrying on like a maniac, oh, the kids, they're going to start taking it because Mark McWarris taking it.

[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.080]
And it's something that's readily available just like Viagra where you can get it without a prescription right over the internet.

[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.160]
I hate to break the news to you, DeFo. You don't need a prescription for this.

[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.040]
It's something you buy in a health food store.

[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.300]
Okay, you don't have to go on the internet to buy this crap.

[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.100]
And I, yeah, I saw that doctor on there last night.

[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.820]
Oh, it's an anabolic steroid.

[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.760]
Yeah, well, if it is, then how come you can buy it without a prescription in a health food store?

[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.960]
Anybody ever wonder about that?

[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.200]
Everybody's a god, they're expert all of a sudden.

[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.980]
And if that one asshole wouldn't have just stuck his nose into Mark McWarris locker, we could have put that all aside.

[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.500]
Oh, they're all going to be running out to buy it because Mark McWarris doing it.

[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.000]
Like I said, I stand by what I said yesterday.

[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.640]
Why have there always got to be people?

[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.620]
I'm supposed to be the sour push, Mr. Negative.

[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.220]
I'm Mr. Happiness, baby.

[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.100]
Doesn't take much to keep me happy.

[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.820]
Just give me a check and turn me loose.

[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.380]
That's all.

[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.080]
By the way, where's that guy?

[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.800]
Where's David?

[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.380]
Would I check?

[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.640]
Yeah, here's the story this morning, the marlins have sold more than 30,000 tickets for each game next week already.

[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.480]
Against the Cardinals.

[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.460]
And have added about 3,000 extra seats by opening up the left-field bleachers.

[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.680]
The section is covered with a tarp, but the tarps coming off for Mark McWarris.

[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.140]
There you go.

[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.140]
Because finally something good is happening.

[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.100]
And we got people like,

[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.680]
and by the way, Geldia, I hate to break the news to you.

[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.960]
The FDA is not the federal drug administration.

[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.440]
The food and drug administration.

[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.540]
Why is that important?

[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.200]
Because if we were just a drug, then maybe they'd regulate it.

[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.560]
But food, as in stuff that's not drugs,

[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.960]
you got little punks opening up big loud mouths and people sitting out there.

[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.440]
Oh, yeah, they know what they're talking about.

[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.280]
That Geldia sure has a lot of credibility.

[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.760]
Don't you?

[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.640]
Oh, yeah, man.

[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.820]
I sit on the edge of my seat, listening to you.

[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.220]
And he's talking about how Henry Aaron had all those racial threats when he was brick and baby with life time,

[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.800]
home run-racket, and Marissa, nothing like that.

[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.120]
I hate to break the news to you.

[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.580]
A lot of people think Roger Marissa got cancer and died because of the stress that he had had took from those obnoxious,

[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.560]
hateful New York fans who boot him mercilessly.

[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.960]
See, first it was Mickey Mantle that every time he didn't hit a home run,

[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.840]
he'd boot the crap out of him because New York fans never, you're never good enough for the New Yorkers.

[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.880]
Never good enough for them.

[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.200]
That short butch here could anyway, but like turn in gray and falling out and the died a horrible death.

[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.240]
So you think Roger Marissa is still alive?

[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.660]
No.

[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.180]
Oh, God.

[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.480]
The knowledge of the sports people in this town.

[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.220]
Of course, it's not just the sports people, it's any topic you pick.

[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.800]
You pick the subject and these people will dazzle you with their ignorance.

[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.440]
Oh, but he's taking a supplement.

[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.660]
Those kids are all going to be like, well, how about all the other stuff they sell in health food stores for people to bulk up, huh?

[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.740]
All those protein shakes and those power drinks and all.

[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.080]
Eight million different supplements for people to bulk up, all of which are like food products.

[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.060]
They're not drugs.

[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.660]
And here's AirVee.

[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.240]
Like I said, Pittsburgh, the other day for the first time since they built the goddamn three-rovers stadium,

[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.740]
they get two sellouts in a row on a team that's going nowhere,

[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.200]
playing against another team that's going nowhere, because finally there's something we can sink our teeth into

[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.240]
that we can be positive and get excited about.

[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.460]
Oh, no, gee, this is a terrible thing.

[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.120]
What's going on in the kids are all going to go...

[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.760]
They're all going to run out.

[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.460]
I see a lot of little kids running out to the health food stores, don't you?

[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.460]
They're all running out there right now.

[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.960]
Whatever Mark McGuire is taking, I want to start taking it right now.

[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.320]
So I can butcher up and be a big guy like him.

[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.520]
And by the way, if that's what it's all about,

[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.340]
Sammy Sosa, who's got 51 home runs,

[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.840]
is he a big, strapping a muscle bound guy?

[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.140]
No.

[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.180]
How about Roger Maris?

[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.860]
Was he a...

[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.020]
No.

[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.340]
There's a lot of guys who have a lot of home runs who aren't like big muscle bound guys.

[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.120]
Some of them were.

[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.520]
Baby Ruth was he a big...

[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.260]
Was he muscle bound?

[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.540]
No, he just had a big pooping.

[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.620]
He was kind of like the fat Joe of baseball.

[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.580]
Babe Ruth...

[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.700]
He was a beard guzzling pig, is what?

[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.460]
Oh, sorry Joe.

[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.880]
But I mean, he was just a fat pig.

[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.800]
He certainly was about as muscular as I,

[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.680]
and in fact, I'm the Babe Ruth of radio.

[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.220]
There you go.

[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.340]
Yeah, skinny arms, skinny legs, big fat gut, not as big as he had.

[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.180]
Because I haven't been...

[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.660]
I'm a better catch-up, huh?

[00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.140]
I better start catching up.

[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.860]
Too much more of that fish food you'll be doing to baby.

[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.140]
So anyway, I don't want to talk anymore about angrosteen,

[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.380]
about the goldsteen, about any of those steens, okay?

[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.400]
Because, just you, you've got enough problems already.

[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.940]
I want to talk about somebody much more important.

[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.860]
I want to give you the real thing right now.

[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.780]
Mr. Call me irresponsible.

[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.140]
The weather furry does it again.

[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.520]
What did I tell you yesterday morning right about this time?

[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.420]
And I'm no meteorologist, baby.

[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.440]
I'm no rocket scientist.

[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.680]
But you did that when you've been through enough of these.

[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.260]
I mean, you start looking very rationally.

[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.720]
You realize that this hurricane wasn't going to...

[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.340]
It's not coming.

[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.440]
It's not hitting here.

[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.840]
What did I say yesterday?

[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.200]
Jesse Helms in North Carolina.

[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.000]
Isn't that what I said?

[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.780]
And where is the big hurricane warning today for Bonnie?

[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.440]
They got hurricane watches in South Carolina and Virginia.

[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.640]
But the warning is in North Carolina.

[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.160]
I stole a nail, and I didn't make a dime for telling you that.

[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.240]
But Brian Northcross, he's on there as late as yesterday.

[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.620]
And they're even using this clown on the CBS National Network News,

[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.080]
and he's poor Ed Bradley has to throw it to Brian Northcross.

[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.300]
And Brian threw it back.

[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.560]
He said, oh, that's not my type.

[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.660]
I have to put him on there on National CBS Network News.

[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.060]
The hysteria man.

[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.220]
Late yesterday afternoon, he's still saying, well, we're not on the woods yet.

[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.260]
And I was waiting for him to start doing what he did that one time a couple of years ago.

[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.400]
And we had another hurricane off.

[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.420]
Sure they never made it here.

[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.100]
And it already had passed as it was moving north of Palm Beach County.

[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.440]
And Brian was standing there in front of the camera trying to bring it back down with his hand.

[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.480]
And though, your hurricane too.

[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.700]
How do you like that?

[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.300]
He had popped up, and he was trying to bring it back down with his goddamn hand.

[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.940]
He brought you a simple tin baby ever since Hurricane Andrew Man.

[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.660]
His guy's ego is bigger than his goddamn, well, it's not saying much.

[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.520]
And he's just out of control.

[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.560]
Oh, yeah, you better watch.

[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.980]
You better go out and because the back down the hatch isn't going to get all that water and batteries.

[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.340]
Yeah, I bet you there's a lot of pissed off people today.

[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.060]
But they'll be ready for the next 10 or 20 hurricanes now,

[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.800]
because they went out and they got their supplies.

[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.820]
Baby, they got stuff that's going to last a year, 25, 25,

[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.720]
after we all been long dead and buried, they got supplies.

[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.280]
Because we've got hysterical people here who are totally irresponsible.

[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.320]
I want to give you the real thing here now.

[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.360]
Yeah, keep it, asshole.

[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.820]
10 minutes after 10 at 5.60, WQAM, WQAM.

[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.680]
So anyway, I got a replica of the Seagar.

[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.820]
Remember, we had that story yesterday from the drug report?

[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.060]
That's somebody faxed to us.

[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.940]
I miss red that I got to confess.

[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.220]
Well, I have to confess the two things.

[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.420]
Number one to show the TV show last night at 9.30, the Worst in History.

[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.700]
And part of the reason it was the Worst in History,

[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.880]
beside the fact that I was in Coherent and Mumbling and Babbling,

[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.340]
was the fact that I had in my Varnam 2T,

[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.460]
I had like a piece of Seagar in between my bottom two teeth.

[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.480]
I wonder where Monica's got a piece of Seagar, huh?

[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.440]
And I didn't have Janet Reno here to finger it out for me.

[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.260]
Monica, mate.

[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.180]
But at any rate, so we got an exact replica,

[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.840]
but I guess I'll have to watch the TV thing to see the replica of the Seagar.

[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.540]
No, this is a slick-wally Seagar that Monica was doing the nasty with.

[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.920]
Yeah, she was doing a little, oh, gee, that down there.

[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.220]
Maybe she even stuck it in a rectum one or two times.

[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.280]
Then of course, you have to wonder the light out back to that.

[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.640]
Well, you know slick-wally, he's got a good sense of humor.

[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.380]
So nice going, Monica.

[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.860]
And I got the goods on Monica today, by the way.

[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.740]
If you want to get the real story and anything in America,

[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.680]
I've been resisting this for years, but it's the truth.

[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.860]
If you want to get the real lowdown, the blowdown,

[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.460]
you've got to go and get the tabloids.

[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.120]
They'll tell you the real story behind the story,

[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.260]
and whether it's real or not, it's good stuff.

[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.880]
The star, baby, there she is right on the front.

[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:30.600]
Monica.

[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.560]
Bill gave me an engagement ring.

[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.500]
I thought he would divorce Hillary and marry me.

[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.860]
The security told me about the first lady and why I saved that towards where it rests.

[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.320]
Oh, we're going to get in all of this good stuff today.

[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.000]
We're getting into good stuff, baby.

[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.680]
It's splattering all over the goddamn place.

[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.480]
This, which is crazier than a bed bug.

[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.880]
And what we've seen about parasites on cigars, they grow in the leaves.

[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.860]
They're, you know, tiny like mites.

[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.100]
Yeah, they might, and they, you know, they might grow on the leaves,

[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.520]
they're cigar leaves, but that only kills them.

[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.180]
So are you suggesting that Monica might have mites in her eye?

[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.440]
Yeah, if you might have parasites and mites in her,

[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.080]
yeah.

[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.720]
Well, don't you think that some way ought to have an examination for that too?

[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.200]
Do you think Paul Shen, who gets rid of those?

[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.500]
Maybe we better call on those two great politicians, Bush Inspector,

[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.980]
to which I check that out.

[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:18.900]
Huh?

[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:20.840]
What?

[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.620]
I think that they better go, when it doubt, check it out.

[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.440]
There's some evidence.

[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.340]
We got to get all the evidence.

[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.800]
Because if it don't fit, oh, and guess how much mail I got yesterday?

[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.560]
Get ready.

[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.320]
Oh, none.

[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:32.360]
None.

[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.500]
So I get home.

[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.900]
I'm just furious.

[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.560]
Okay, I go over to my private box.

[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.120]
I open it up.

[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:39.860]
It's empty.

[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.800]
It's like Mother Hubbard's covered on a bad day.

[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.400]
I go home and I call my, you know, you open up the US Postal Service

[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.980]
and the White Pages and it's got each zip code.

[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.940]
It's got its own phone number.

[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.200]
And you go through the whole thing.

[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.220]
It's like a Phil Henry bed.

[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.580]
You know, dial one, press one.

[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.180]
If you rely, press once it on the floor.

[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.060]
Stick it up, you're asked.

[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.760]
I finally get somebody on there, a living and breathing lady,

[00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.080]
who seemed fairly reasonable.

[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.280]
And she's giving me a song and a dance about, well, you know,

[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.880]
in the beginning, it's very, very slow.

[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:06.880]
I said, no kidding.

[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.960]
And then she's telling me like I said about,

[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.180]
was 17 days ago that I put in those change of address cards.

[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.500]
She says, well, have you gotten some mail yet?

[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.100]
I said yes.

[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.460]
Well, you know, that's pretty, pretty fortunate because usually it takes,

[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.300]
at least 10 to 14 days to get even the first bit, like,

[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.380]
boy, you should count your lucky stars, mister.

[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.980]
What you be complaining about.

[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.080]
So then I have to give her all the information.

[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.340]
Over again, she's going to like put a double check on it,

[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.040]
but have no fear.

[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.300]
She says, because in the beginning, it's very, very slow.

[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.800]
Because it's the rise now.

[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.420]
Whatever the hell that means.

[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.740]
Does that make any sense to you?

[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.340]
I'm trying to ask you just a couple of reasonable questions,

[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.620]
not screaming, not hysterical, about like,

[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.920]
what's the logic behind that?

[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.780]
Why would it be slow?

[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.500]
Once they put in the change of address,

[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.520]
and once it's in a computer,

[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.640]
why doesn't everything just automatically funnel over to a,

[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.300]
oh no, in the beginning, it's very, very, very slow.

[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.420]
Is what she said.

[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.380]
And I said, oh.

[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.140]
Here's a lady in Hellendale. Hello.

[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:07.380]
Hello.

[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.340]
Meal.

[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:08.720]
Yes?

[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:09.420]
Good.

[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.440]
I do.

[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.700]
Going to 76 year old lady.

[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.500]
Oh, and I just discussed it to you.

[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.060]
Oh no, my husband's been listening to you for years.

[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:23.740]
Uh-huh.

[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.260]
And I just want to tell you, you're just fantastic.

[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.560]
You're wonderful.

[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.660]
And I love listening to you.

[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:32.980]
Hi.

[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.880]
I want you at 9.30.

[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.020]
Yeah, you're the one.

[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.860]
And then I want you at 10.30 and I have to sit through

[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.260]
that stupid boy.

[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.940]
Oh, that's sports, you're killing me.

[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.640]
It's good.

[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.380]
You're rid of them.

[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.980]
They got to be deported, especially that laughing hyena guy

[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.460]
that's always grinning from ear to ear.

[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.980]
He's too happy for me.

[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:53.540]
Right.

[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:54.660]
Well, Zagazan.

[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:55.900]
Thank you.

[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:56.860]
And happy as Sukhas.

[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.520]
Be well.

[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.400]
And back to you.

[00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.200]
So long.

[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.700]
Okay, how do you like that?

[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.800]
They love me in hell and hell.

[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.700]
Or cry from those old sunny Rosenberg days when that old bastard

[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.960]
was trying to get me off the air.

[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.360]
Oh, yeah, we're going to draft a resolution in the city of hell and

[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.180]
deal to try to get Neil Rogers off the air because he's making fun of us

[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.900]
seeing how old parts will be here in hell and hell.

[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.800]
Because he's telling the guy them truth.

[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.180]
Sonny Rosenberg and son of a bitch is still alive.

[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.560]
Boy, is it how they blow in hot air in here today or what?

[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.920]
Man, oh man, I think this is the day we get the gas in this joint.

[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.500]
It is steamy in here.

[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.740]
So I asked, please, anybody with our TV crew, if I have like a bunch of

[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.500]
schmutz, I would be well advised during a break early in the show to let me know to

[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.080]
tip me off.

[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.120]
Because that's all I kept looking at during that whole half hour, so to breast by

[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.900]
10 o'clock last night, I was so depressed by that 930 show on whammy.

[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.240]
I mean, the fact that it's stuck to begin with, that was bad enough, but the fact that

[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.200]
I had that theory to my teeth reminded me of that spot where the guy goes to

[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.600]
Japan for the big business meeting.

[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.860]
And his secret theories are like following them down the hall, they're wiping the

[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.880]
dandruff off the shoulders of a suit.

[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.060]
And they got them all spiffed up and then he goes meets the Japanese guy in

[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.940]
shakes his hand, opens up his mouth, he's got a big piece of like, you know,

[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.460]
mong between his teeth.

[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.680]
And that's what I had.

[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.920]
So I apologize profusely for that mong between my teeth.

[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.780]
Anybody out there ever have mong between their teeth?

[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.660]
I bet you did.

[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.600]
It's better than the mong that Monica's got between her teeth.

[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.180]
Here's a mobile in poppano. Hello?

[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.260]
Hey, Nina, how are you doing?

[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:25.760]
Okay, sir?

[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.220]
Long time first time.

[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:27.740]
Yes, sir?

[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.520]
Hey, do you know Jerry Glowow?

[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.380]
Do I know what?

[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:32.840]
Jerry Glowow.

[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.100]
No.

[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.300]
Okay, we have an open line of day one and Broward, 567-0560, pound 560, on our

[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.020]
prestigious AT&T wireless line.

[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.780]
Here's Boka. Hello?

[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.020]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir?

[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.140]
Oh, boy, I got a fall down.

[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:45.700]
Uh-huh.

[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:46.800]
How you doing, buddy? I got a fall down.

[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.440]
Another one of our little spicks that's got no life.

[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.000]
Yes, go ahead.

[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:50.880]
I got a story.

[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.540]
I got a little fraternity, a little club of these guys.

[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:54.980]
Yeah, they're all squeezing and grabbing.

[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.760]
And when they're not squeezing and grabbing each other, they're grabbing our phone, yeah.

[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.600]
I was up in Atlantic City and I'm playing the mokin' around playing the dice games.

[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.780]
And I come up to one table and there's a bunch of guys and they're all winning.

[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.560]
And every time they would make the point, you know,

[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.100]
or they would start yelling out some of your cards.

[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.880]
All of a sudden I walk up and I hear, you know,

[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:23.860]
I hear the one guy going, I don't have any cavities because I don't have any teeth.

[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.560]
And then he would throw the dice.

[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.320]
And I got to know these guys and it was great. We had a fall.

[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:29.400]
Yeah.

[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.520]
So I just found you where up there.

[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.120]
What does that mean? They were from here?

[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.680]
Yeah, they just could have found us.

[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.200]
They're up in Atlantic City because there of course is nothing to do here.

[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.960]
And you don't want to go out on any of the boats here.

[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.040]
That's where they are. Sure.

[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.060]
We did that, by the way.

[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.900]
We went out on the boat and my dad was down and he wanted to gamble.

[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.500]
So we go out on one of the casino boats from Palm Beach.

[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.200]
We get there. They don't have the buffet.

[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.940]
So we're all starving and they're given a few crappy little sandwiches.

[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:55.580]
Yeah.

[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.140]
Well, that'll teach you to go on those damn cruise ships, I'm telling you.

[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.200]
You have to be out of your mind to go on that crap.

[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.720]
I know. We have stuck.

[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.640]
But hey, remember one thing, you guys were talking about parasites on the leaves of the tobacco.

[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.160]
Yeah.

[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.960]
You know, Castro hates our guts.

[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.900]
You can just imagine what you roll in those things because half the time,

[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.680]
whenever I'm out of these clubs, they smell like mong in there.

[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.160]
I don't know what. Yeah.

[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.980]
I mean, that's what it's all about.

[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.960]
You guys are smoking, you know, whatever.

[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.720]
He's probably shipping back the, you know, these guys that are smuggling in the illegal Cuban cigars.

[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.360]
He's probably sending us the same poisons cigar that we were trying to kill him with a few years ago.

[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.400]
That's right. Their cow passers are very clean over there if you know what I mean.

[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.200]
Yeah, they really are.

[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.400]
I'm glad to see you in Atlantic City.

[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.660]
Not what a horrible place that is.

[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.340]
But like he said, better to go on those cruise ships and get ripped off.

[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.180]
And since depots are concerned for all those little kids out there,

[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.580]
how about all the little kids that are listening to this radio station?

[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.820]
And instead of hearing about sports much of the time they're hearing about illegal gambling?

[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.120]
What about that, depot?

[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.460]
Mr. Self-righteous, Mr. Mr. Protector of the Youngsters of America?

[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.000]
I thought this was supposed to be a station where they discuss sports,

[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.580]
not giving the odds and every on Tiddly Wing's games.

[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.440]
We got about 15 hours of that crap on this station every day and day.

[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:09.240]
Oh, who do you like in the Mizzula State Arkansas Polytechnic Institute soccer game, huh?

[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.580]
What's a spread on that?

[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.620]
Thank God we don't encourage anybody to gamble illegally on this radio station.

[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.000]
Thank God for that, baby.

[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:18.440]
Oh!

[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.640]
So anyway, Monica's a big one.

[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.120]
Oh, I love this thing.

[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.940]
I just love the feeling texture of this.

[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.480]
I have never had anything this big.

[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.260]
I'll confess in my hands.

[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.960]
This is mammoth.

[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.800]
And this is a aliyados.

[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.000]
This is a real Cuban cigar, by the way.

[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.920]
This ain't one of those, this isn't make-believe.

[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:36.920]
This is an aliyados.

[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.880]
Joggenic a monster cigar.

[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.460]
Even Kathy Willis had a hard time dealing with this.

[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.180]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:46.460]
Hello?

[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:47.540]
Here.

[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.160]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:48.940]
Good morning.

[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.440]
Funny I was calling you about a Christian story, too, that happened to me and my family this weekend.

[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.940]
We just got off the stopper to see it yesterday.

[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.700]
And something weird happened.

[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.940]
They said the hurricane was going to possibly come and hit us when we got out of that door.

[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.920]
So on the ship, the captain makes an announcement that they were pulling out at nine o'clock at night.

[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.120]
And we have to go out to see because of the saver, which means it's safer for them, not for us.

[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.340]
They can't be in port.

[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.320]
So everybody with any short version how to cancel it.

[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.940]
And then he said we're on a way to Cropo Cape for a wonderful day, which we've been waiting for for a year.

[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.720]
We get out to see about two hours later, as well as in gentlemen, I've got dead news for you.

[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.040]
And there was 2642 passengers on the ship.

[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:37.060]
The captain says, I'm sorry to tell you, but due to the unsure direction of Hurricane Bonnie, we're not going to Cropo Cape.

[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:44.000]
So everything was canceled and we ended up circling Fimini for the entire day on Sunday going around in circles doing nothing.

[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.440]
And everybody else, well, what are you going to do to help the passengers?

[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.260]
Nothing is an act of God. That's too bad.

[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.820]
And that's the way it is.

[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.640]
And there were a lot of eye-raised people on the ship.

[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.280]
There were too many things to come.

[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.340]
Exactly. They wouldn't do anything to compensate people on a future ship or anything on the cruise.

[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.000]
And what's your opinion? I think that's pretty unfair for all of us.

[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.720]
My opinion is don't do it again, pal.

[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.800]
I cruise ships. You couldn't give me one of those if you gave me a thousand dollars to gamble with.

[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:16.960]
One thing about Vegas, you know, even if it's like storming outside when you're inside a casino, you don't have to worry about it.

[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.880]
Don't have to worry about hurricanes, typhoons, natural disasters.

[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.300]
That's why I prefer Vegas myself because that's where you have a great time.

[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.220]
I know it's far in its ischlep, et cetera, et cetera.

[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.860]
But these people that want to go on these cruise ships, that's what's going to happen.

[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.420]
And the food blows, I don't care what anybody tells you.

[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.440]
The food blows.

[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.380]
And you wind up under with a crowd of all these old people with dandruff and diarrhea and gangrene and the, oh, God.

[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.520]
It's great. And then, of course, you're a captive audience.

[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.040]
Because once you're on there, you can't get off, so to speak.

[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:53.060]
Two open lines, and day one and brow at five six seven, oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18 T wireless line.

[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.720]
Wait till you see this George.

[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.060]
Hmm, this is going to be fun.

[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.040]
I saw it.

[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.020]
Yeah, but did you look at the wireless?

[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.920]
Well, we'll get to one of them on here. You're just going to pee your pants.

[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.320]
1026 at five sixty WQA. And you know, our friends.

[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.820]
You know where one glove get in for half price. Bring your kids. Get in free.

[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.960]
Splash around the high water pants, waiting pool.

[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.180]
Clip and slide around in the moonwalk moonwalk.

[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.860]
Check out the many noses of Michael Jackson and the elephant man's bones in the freak show museum.

[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.300]
The weather never changes inside the hyperbaric and closed dome chamber.

[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:36.020]
Hey kids, if you get a little tired walking around a majestic kingdom theme parking casino, join Michael in his king of pop size bed for a sleepover.

[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.120]
Don't worry, parents. There could be some big money in it for you in an out of court settlement.

[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:46.100]
You know, it's time to visit the majestic kingdom theme parking casino when the big hands on the little hand.

[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.960]
Don't associate it with Michael Jackson anyway, shape.

[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.140]
Okay, 10 30 at five sixty WQA. Let's see.

[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:59.480]
We got Jim Manditz today. How do you like that? Manditz for Hank who's still on vacation to the six Kimba Volkamp or briefly six to seven thirty.

[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.780]
And then we got the Marlins at the Cardinals.

[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.900]
Even though the Marlins have lost 2,000 games in a row, we finally stuck in it.

[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.520]
And then we got to the meat of the matter. The Marlins at the Cardinals tonight as Mark McGuire goes for number 54.

[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:16.520]
So anyway, world exclusive secret testimony revealed for the very first time.

[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.780]
Monica, I thought Bill was going to marry me.

[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:23.320]
So Monica, a classy bitch if there ever was one.

[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:32.840]
That's right. Monica Lewinsky has alleged that President Clinton gave her a silver engagement ring during the 18 month relationship star has learned this is in the star.

[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.980]
And if it's in the star, you know, it's the Emma's.

[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:45.160]
The 25 year old former intern at the center of the White House sex scandal made the bombshell disclosure to legal advisors as she prepared for her top secret testimony to the grand jury.

[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:51.180]
Monica told a friend, Bill called a differentiate bring, but to me it meant that we were secretly engaged.

[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.780]
I still have that ring. We were secretly engaged.

[00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:01.540]
I was convinced without a doubt that he would divorce Hillary after he left office and marry me.

[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:07.360]
Amazingly she told her friends that she still hopes someday Bill Clinton will be all hers.

[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:16.020]
That's right. This is after she testified by the way after she whipped out her address with a stain and all this other business.

[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.460]
She still hopes that someday Bill will be all hers.

[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:24.440]
He knows that I still love him Monica said nothing's impossible if you want it badly enough.

[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:36.960]
The friend who talked with Monica on a regular basis in the days before she testified before the same Washington grand jury as President Clinton reveals that she also claims she set out to seduce Clinton from her first day on the job in the White House.

[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.660]
She once had sex with him in the back seat of the presidential limo.

[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.460]
Oh my God.

[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:49.840]
Okay. Clinton complained to her that he was unhappy with Hillary because the first lady did not satisfy his needs.

[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:59.940]
Monica kept the infamous blue dress with a presidential semen on it for evidence as my ace in the hole in case Bill's powerful friends ever tried to destroy me.

[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.920]
It was her ace in the what hole.

[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:10.420]
But the friend says that Monica is now shattered by the devastating impact that her testimony about the sexual activities in the White House is had on Clinton.

[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.500]
The only man the starry eyed young woman in Siss she has ever loved.

[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.900]
Got it? Are you following this please take notes.

[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:24.240]
She cries herself to sleep at night to source the close source tell star about the shaken young woman. She's shaking it.

[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.720]
Monica says over and over again.

[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:33.320]
I prayed and cried for months that I wouldn't have to testify against the man I love and that I could keep the damn dress hidden forever.

[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.640]
But I had no choice.

[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.360]
My mother told me sweetie you can't go to jail for that man. I won't allow it.

[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.960]
Now she just prays that the president can somehow forgive her and that someday he'll love her again.

[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:53.380]
The source says that Monica who now divides her time between a luxurious apartment in the famous Watergate complex in Washington DC

[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:58.580]
and her father and step others cozy at costly home in Brentwood California Brentwood.

[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.660]
Hey guess who we can get to get her.

[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:08.060]
Swear that she and Clinton never had intercourse never ever she says never never never ever.

[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:14.260]
In fact Monica said their intimate moments involved only groping, fondling, kissing and oral sex.

[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:14.900]
Oh my god.

[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:21.300]
The sex was quick and fast the friend quotes Monica telling her but to me it meant everything because I loved him.

[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:31.460]
Although stars been unable to confirm her story she insisted to the friend that she and the president got it got it on in the back seat of a big black limousine, a big black limousine riding around Washington.

[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.620]
Being guarded by a big black guy named Eisen.

[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:41.120]
I'd always begged him to take me out somewhere she claimed even though I knew he really couldn't go to a restaurant a movie or anything like that.

[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.460]
I felt so loved and so important that night.

[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.220]
It was the only time she said that they did anything sexually outside the White House.

[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:54.680]
She said that all the other sex campaigns took place in a study of joining the Oval Office sometimes on a sofa.

[00:24:55.860 --> 00:25:04.120]
Monica said that she once begged the president to take her up to the families of private living quarters in the White House when Hillary was out of town but Bill refused.

[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.780]
Somebody else I guess must have been waiting up there.

[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.620]
It wasn't that I wanted to do anything with him up there she said but I was curious to see how he lived.

[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.300]
Monica told the friend about her bizarre relationship with the president.

[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.360]
Bill never discussed marrying me but he did tell me that he loved me and loved being with me.

[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:20.240]
Oh boy.

[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.520]
He said that he thought I was very pretty and intelligence for some of my age.

[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:30.800]
Other sources tell star that many of Lewinsky's friends think she was living in a fantasy world.

[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.980]
Clinton discovered the only way he could keep Monica happy was by letting her believe that someday he'd be all hers at one source.

[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:42.760]
It's not like he promised to the world but he didn't say little things which Monica read a lot more into them what was actually being said.

[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.460]
Boy that's the first isn't it?

[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.240]
Oh God.

[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.260]
Clinton became her dream man.

[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.440]
She had visions of walking on the beach hand and gland in hand with him in Malibu.

[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:56.760]
Someday after the year 2000 after he divorced Hillary and was working in Hollywood and starting a new life with Monica.

[00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.640]
Monica became consumed by her infatuation with the president.

[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.340]
She wanted his baby.

[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.800]
She wanted to be his wife.

[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:09.940]
And by making the imply promises he did Clinton was playing right into that right into her hands.

[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:18.340]
Monica's friend tells star that although she's never met Hillary Rodden Clinton or the Clinton's daughter Chelsea the ex interned and gleefully admits I hated Hillary.

[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.620]
That bitch.

[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.220]
I turned against her after Bill told me my wife does not satisfy my needs.

[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:28.360]
She's just not interested in what I am is what he said.

[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:29.860]
That's right.

[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.060]
I'll admit that though I was also jealous of her because she is after all married to him.

[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:41.360]
Monica became tyranny and emotional when telling why she lied at first about her sexual involvement with continued on page 8.

[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:42.640]
Clinton.

[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.700]
I did it to protect that man.

[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.200]
I loved and still loved she said while adding that the president never ordered me to lie to protect him.

[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.660]
But you know you can sense when somebody wants you to do something without coming without insisting it.

[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:59.020]
Let's just say that I was under very subtle pressure that an eye or a fair if it ever came up if it ever popped up.

[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:06.740]
He said that what we were doing isn't really sex Monica said and when I went and looked up sex in the dictionary because I was a little bit confused.

[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.240]
Are you following this?

[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.900]
She went and looked it up in the dick.

[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:16.480]
Scenario because she was a little confused but eventually came to the same decision even though deep down I knew what the truth was.

[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.640]
She looked it up in the dick.

[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:19.360]
Scenario.

[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.500]
And she said this isn't really sex is it?

[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.080]
No.

[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:30.380]
Monica made no secret in the fact that it was she who pursued the president not the other way around.

[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:38.280]
She admitted that she made the first move in her sexual affair with the president as soon as she began her job as an intern at the White House in November of 1995.

[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.320]
I made sure he noticed me when I was interning Monica Bragg.

[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.240]
I made sure that he could tell by the way I looked at him that I was definitely available to him.

[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.820]
I flirted every chance I got.

[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.400]
Those reputation was no secret so I knew he'd pick up on my signals.

[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:56.380]
I'd wear something low cut once I flashed him a peek at my phone panties and sure enough he did.

[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.340]
He peeped.

[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.640]
I knew that if we were alone something was going to happen.

[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:00.700]
And it did.

[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.360]
Monica claimed that she had sex with the president.

[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.440]
The very first day she worked in the West Wing near the oral office according to one source, the first guy damn day.

[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.980]
I wore a very sexy dress my first day and it did the trick.

[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.100]
The source quote through his saying.

[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.300]
We never said a word to each other until he's signal for me to join him in his orifice.

[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.560]
He passed by me three times on that day and the third time gave me a signal to meet him in the orifice.

[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:23.540]
That's right.

[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:28.080]
I was shocked that we actually fooled around especially since it was my first day on the job in that part of the White House.

[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.340]
But it was a total turn on.

[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.140]
It was so sexy the first time.

[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.020]
Without a doubt Bill Clinton is one of the kindest men I've ever met.

[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.060]
And the absolute truth is that I pursued him says Monica.

[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.740]
I wanted him and I got him.

[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:44.640]
Monica told her close friends about her anguish about providing prosecutors.

[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.740]
The blue dress she had saved with president Clinton's semen on it.

[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:53.960]
Monica said the dress became stained by Clinton after she deliberately aroused him in the study of the oral office.

[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.380]
We both were embarrassed when he did that to my dress.

[00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.140]
Monica recalled.

[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.000]
And I was scared to death that one of the secret service men standing guard outside would see it.

[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.460]
I kept my hand over it when I walked out but my knees were really knocking.

[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.060]
Her knees were knocking.

[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.080]
She kept her hand over it and the drama stained too.

[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.300]
Oh God this is good.

[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.160]
She said she deliberately kept the unwashed dress in her closet ever since then.

[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.220]
I was told that if Kenneth star ever got hold of my dress the president would be toast.

[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.560]
Well now they have the dress and I betrayed the only man I've ever loved and still loved.

[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:30.540]
She cheerily admitted that my mother thought it was a clever move keeping the dress for so long.

[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:39.100]
I knew that Bill wouldn't just let me hang out there to dry over our fair but his friends would have done it in a heartbeat if I didn't have some evidence to fight them.

[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.540]
I knew that my mom knew that.

[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.880]
First stunningly beautiful mother Marsha Lewis 49.

[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:51.400]
His divorce from Monica's dad Dr. Bernard Lewinsky and his number to the rich and powerful Democratic political power broker Robert Strauss 75.

[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.060]
Robert Strauss who was the former chairman of the Democratic Party.

[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.640]
Oh my God.

[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:04.820]
The friend told star when Monica told her mother that she had this never laundered blue dress with stains to prove that she and Clinton were sexually involved.

[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.800]
She said her mother told her get that dress to me as fast as you can.

[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.000]
I'll make sure nothing happens to it.

[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:12.880]
Mama said.

[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.680]
Mama La dress.

[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.720]
Another source says the end of the relationship between Clinton and Monica came when she began making demands on him.

[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:29.280]
Monica started falling in love with the president was pressuring him for real dates and full sexual relations the source explains.

[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:34.400]
He became so fed up with being used as the president's sex doll that one day she gave him an ultimatum.

[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:42.060]
Satisfied me sexually or that's it Bill promised her it would get better and more intimate as soon as he figured out the logistics to make it work.

[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.540]
That was the last time Lewinsky met with the president alone.

[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.760]
He decided at that point it was over.

[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.180]
Get out of here you bitch.

[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.740]
Friends now say though they were here for the health of the overweight and overstressed Monica.

[00:30:55.260 --> 00:31:00.040]
Twice she was strongly advised to see a shrink and she did go into therapy but right now nothing helps.

[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.400]
We listen to pressure.

[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:03.500]
Meaning.

[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.140]
That's right.

[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:05.940]
She's went and down.

[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:06.600]
She's picking out.

[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.740]
She's shoveling it down her purse and a food too.

[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:15.720]
Twice she's been to fat farms but the last time she only stayed for a couple of days she was too distracted to stick with her.

[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:24.780]
Now Monica is getting sensitive about her weight and her image that she even phoned up a comedy writer she knew in LA and demanded to get word to Jay Leno to stop making such horrible jokes about her.

[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:29.400]
She never wanted any of this to come out this way it all sounds so sort of dirty but her it was beautiful.

[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.880]
Her was deep and mutual love.

[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.420]
You can't imagine how devastated she is.

[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.560]
It's taken a gigantic toll on her.

[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:50.000]
What are we going to do with a big fat one and Monica's huh?

[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.700]
Oh my god.

[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.960]
Does that give you a little bit better insight as to what kind of a psycho bitch we'd be talking about here?

[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.520]
Crazy or then a bed bug?

[00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:58.500]
Yeah.

[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.340]
And mommy says get that dress to me right away.

[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.680]
I'll take good care of it for you.

[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:08.080]
I got my book writer over here and the guy's going to write the screenplay.

[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.640]
Oh yeah.

[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.320]
Lonely 50.

[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:10.900]
Lonely 50.

[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.860]
$2 million right.

[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:13.920]
So there you go.

[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.300]
Twenty before 11 and 560 WQM.

[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.620]
You A.M.

[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.400]
Here's the cuts for Saturday, November 29, 1997.

[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:22.420]
King Nein.

[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.660]
Yellow, I'm Captain B.J. Boy Bobbin.

[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:30.720]
Welcome to another Shatterday Morning Edition of Tight Lines and Good Fishin.

[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.140]
We'll ask Knight I ran into some rough waters in a nature department store

[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.320]
when the toilet's overflowing.

[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:43.880]
But that didn't deter me from this covering an unusual variety of glory holds.

[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:49.320]
Now the first one was of a downed variety with a rough jagged texture

[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:55.080]
that maybe a small one could get through safely but well I wouldn't advise it.

[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:59.920]
The other one was meticulously centered drilled to three inches in diameter

[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.960]
and reinforced with a beveled plastic safety ring.

[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.960]
And somebody took real care to let the big ones on through.

[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.100]
Where are they biting tonight?

[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:14.940]
Well I suggest dealers, Nordstroms or even Walmart.

[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:17.200]
Well that's all for now.

[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.780]
I'm Captain B.J. Boy Bobbin.

[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.100]
Tight Lines and Good Fishin.

[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.720]
You're looking for glory holds.

[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:27.120]
Okay 1045 at 560 WQM. Happy Tuesday to you.

[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.660]
We've got 400 open lines here of course.

[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.880]
We got one week there were...

[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.820]
Hang on, what is it? One week?

[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.320]
But we can have to labor day till we get through that.

[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:34.940]
Almost two weeks. Oh my god.

[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.560]
And then once we get past that there might be some living and breathing people coming back to town

[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.860]
and just maybe life will be a little bit easier, huh?

[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.060]
Maybe we can proceed.

[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.240]
Two open lines and day two and Broward 567-0560.

[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.640]
Pompive 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.140]
Here's Weston. Hello.

[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:52.560]
Weston.

[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:53.720]
Hello.

[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:54.340]
Yes sir.

[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:54.780]
Neil.

[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:55.300]
Yes.

[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:56.640]
Okay.

[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:56.700]
Hi.

[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.540]
See I've been watching a show on ramming.

[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:00.960]
Yes?

[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.540]
Ever since I got out of school man I'm 17.

[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.680]
The show is great.

[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:07.300]
Yeah.

[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:08.780]
Well...

[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.680]
Sir for last night when I had that mung between my teeth.

[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.180]
Okay. Well...

[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.580]
So I'm at comparison with the igwire.

[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.700]
What is it?

[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:20.820]
The comparison.

[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:21.640]
You know the...

[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.860]
You know the A's, now he's with the Cardinals.

[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:25.320]
Yeah.

[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.860]
And what does he call that?

[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:29.660]
What does he take?

[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:30.320]
The...

[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:30.960]
The...

[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.400]
The same thing as right-em and see.

[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.640]
Yeah he's taking a lot of vitamin C like Monica was doing.

[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:39.580]
We have an open line and day one in Broward 567-0560.

[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.980]
Pompive 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.160]
Here's...

[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.940]
Oh let's do highly upwork with 25 question marks as we know who it is.

[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:46.180]
Hello.

[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.260]
Hey Neil how's it going?

[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:47.620]
Okay.

[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.360]
Hey man, how about them hurricanes out there sitting out there?

[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.120]
Now one goes away and Channel Sound is already bumping up eight more of them.

[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:54.600]
Uh-huh.

[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.400]
They're bumping it.

[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.220]
Yeah, bumping everything over there.

[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.300]
Hey Neil, let me ask you a question now.

[00:34:59.340 --> 00:34:59.420]
Yeah.

[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.940]
Can that frequency went off the air right?

[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.020]
You did?

[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.420]
Yeah, I guess it did.

[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:04.020]
No it did not.

[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.860]
What are they in high 80s right now?

[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.400]
Are they running repeats though?

[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.600]
They're running our new original craft every night.

[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.900]
Hey how can I get a copy of your...

[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.440]
Why would you say that it went off the air when they got a...

[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:14.560]
Crap.

[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:15.740]
Yeah, why would you do that?

[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.020]
Because we called them yesterday and said they were off the air.

[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:19.960]
You called who?

[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:20.940]
Anthony Moreno.

[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.760]
Where's the one thing that was off the air?

[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.140]
Uh-huh.

[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.020]
Okay, whatever you say.

[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:25.920]
Another jacket.

[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:26.720]
Another one here of people.

[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.720]
I'm telling you.

[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.060]
Two open lines in day one and brown.

[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.400]
Five, six, seven, eight, five, six, eight, five, six, eight.

[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.340]
Who does Anthony Moreno?

[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.320]
Is his boyfriend or is it somebody who works over there, huh?

[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.280]
Is somebody who works there?

[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:36.860]
He's the host.

[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:37.460]
A host.

[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:38.520]
A host.

[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:39.680]
The host?

[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.580]
I thought that's what you're supposed to put in your mouth at, uh...

[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:43.900]
Communion.

[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.220]
Is that what you put in your mouth, the host?

[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.300]
Now what Phil says?

[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.180]
The host.

[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.300]
Okay, let's go to a candle.

[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:49.620]
Phil, hello.

[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.140]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:51.600]
Yes, sir.

[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.280]
Listen, I'm home with a broken foot, but I'm taking time out to help you with your male problem.

[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:57.600]
Uh...

[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.020]
I don't have a meal problem, I have a meal.

[00:35:59.020 --> 00:35:59.680]
Me, a meal.

[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.120]
Oh, I see.

[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:06.200]
I'm a proud member for 23 years of the best male system in the world, the United States possible.

[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.300]
The world's worst, yeah.

[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.740]
The world's worst.

[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.140]
Let me tell you, I'm having a good day.

[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.440]
Even the other one in the house of Siberia, they have better delivery and better service than we got here.

[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:14.140]
No way.

[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:14.500]
At lower price.

[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.300]
No way.

[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.420]
Yeah, you're in tea.

[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.500]
Okay, now, wait.

[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:23.160]
Listen, local male, we got 90 percent, at over 90 percent delivery the next day.

[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.740]
Now, the problem is this, if you have a male coming from the state, that's a two or three days delivery.

[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:28.400]
Number one.

[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.500]
Number two.

[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:30.400]
When that...

[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.180]
Well, what do you have to do with changing my address?

[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:38.260]
Okay, but we're talking about 18 days today, and a lot of male I've gotten, you could stick in your rectum and have lukewarm left over for Monica.

[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.500]
That is not acceptable.

[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:40.560]
Let me...

[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.540]
Very good.

[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.460]
It is not acceptable.

[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:43.180]
Okay, I agree with you.

[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.360]
I concur wholeheartedly.

[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.640]
Let me explain to you what happened.

[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:52.440]
When your male comes, it comes first to the male, the main processing facility, you know, prowered.

[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:52.680]
Right.

[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.220]
From there, it goes to your old station.

[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.460]
Now, your old car...

[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.340]
My very old...

[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:04.960]
Your old car, you had to send it back to the main processing center so that they can put the yellow label on it.

[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:05.840]
You know, for the computer.

[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.920]
From there, it goes to the new station where you live now.

[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:13.560]
So, if you have a problem, where it's taken that long,

[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:19.240]
it has to originate from your old station with your old carrier, who may not be sending the mail.

[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.760]
What do you mean with my old carrier?

[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.500]
I've got 15...

[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.980]
I used to have like one guy, Rick, who's a good guy.

[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.400]
He used to deliver my mail for a long time.

[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.620]
Then he's on a different route now, whatever in the neighborhood, but not my street.

[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.160]
Then I had a very nice blind lady who delivered it for a long time.

[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.180]
I knew her, she knew me.

[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.080]
And now there's a different mail carrier, a letter carrier on that street.

[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.060]
Every three days, there's somebody different on there.

[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.080]
So you got a call?

[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:42.240]
In fact, the person that I gave the cards to, I never even saw this guy again.

[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.960]
I never saw before, I'll never see him again.

[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.720]
Okay, what you got to do, Neil?

[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.420]
You got to talk to the manager of your old station.

[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:53.540]
Yeah, I really called there yesterday, and after getting 72 different punching one and two

[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.980]
and punching somebody in the push, I got to run around.

[00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.020]
All right, well, the problem's got to be there to see if there is a problem.

[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:01.420]
There is a problem.

[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.460]
Where it's not going through the problem.

[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.460]
He said it's really, really slow in the beginning.

[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:06.880]
Okay, well...

[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.580]
What kind of an answer is that? It's really slow.

[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:13.200]
Well, at the beginning, because in other words, they have to put the new address on the computer.

[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:13.960]
Okay?

[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.440]
But once it's in there, in other words, if I'm already getting mail sent to that address,

[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.760]
that means it's at the computer, right?

[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:24.060]
So once that's done, what's the excuse for all the rest of it that's sitting piling up somewhere

[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.580]
that it's taken so long for the pony to get across town?

[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.820]
The main problem's got to be with your old station.

[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.640]
If they're not sending the mail right away, the main processing center.

[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:34.600]
Okay?

[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.140]
Well, why would they be doing that? What are they doing?

[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.420]
Holding out a word for a rainy day?

[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.960]
Well, they are all busy.

[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.800]
You would like to pay my bills, Tommy, is that it?

[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.660]
It is supposed to be sent daily.

[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.500]
Okay? They're supposed to send it out daily, well...

[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.460]
Okay, let me say it again. I went to that box on Saturday, nothing.

[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.960]
Zipity Duda, empty. Like mother Hubbard's covered.

[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.540]
I went there yesterday. I slept over there yesterday after work.

[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.240]
Again, empty. Zipity Duda. I asked the guy that works there.

[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.340]
I said, is the mail up from today? Everything's up.

[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.480]
My box empty one more time, okay?

[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:01.760]
That may not be possible.

[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:06.740]
So I get more mail in one day on a normal day than all the people who listen to this show put together.

[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.780]
Okay, now what's going to get? You're just going to get bulk mail.

[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:10.800]
You know where it's junk mail.

[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.100]
I'm talking first class mail. I'm talking bills.

[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.800]
I'm talking about real mail. The check from Ed McMahon, whatever it is that I'm waiting for.

[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.640]
Real honest to God mail. Where is it?

[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.220]
Okay, well, my advice to you, Neil. Number one.

[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:22.760]
Any...

[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.140]
Get a gun.

[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.100]
Any real important mail like checks that you're expecting.

[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.500]
Call those people and give them your number.

[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:28.640]
What?

[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.760]
Respecting checks from David from Awanny.

[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.980]
He's... who knows where the hell he is with my check.

[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:33.900]
Okay, well...

[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.220]
If the people...

[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:36.260]
Right, I have the check and then David had the check.

[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.740]
No, I think Pat Joe had the check and he cashed in 8... 8 of all up, yeah.

[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.440]
Well, I have an 8 to check.

[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.780]
Anything important? Call these people...

[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.560]
Well, it's on the account.

[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:45.280]
I'm going to eat it.

[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:52.420]
Okay, but the other mail is going to take longer than usual because there's like two or three steps involved in getting your mail.

[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.600]
Well, one other mail. What other mail you'll be talking about?

[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.240]
Well, any... in other words, what I'm saying is if you have a real important mail you're expecting.

[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000]
Okay, call those people.

[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.240]
Like bills, you're electric bill, you're phone bill, you're credit card bill.

[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.520]
Like mail that ordinary regular honest to God, people get every day.

[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.400]
That's important mail.

[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:08.740]
Yes, it is.

[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.180]
Because I like to pay my bills like sometime this year, you know?

[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.280]
Well, it should take at most like three or four more days from normal.

[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.800]
That's at most, but it should take not 18 days.

[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:18.240]
Yeah.

[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.820]
So, you know, if you...

[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:21.940]
Well, today is day number 18 and counting.

[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:22.840]
Okay, well, that's a good...

[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:27.080]
And if I go over there this afternoon after a luscious mommy's house, there's no mail in my box.

[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.260]
I'm going to pop a gut, okay?

[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.340]
I'm going to pop a bone and pop a gut.

[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.460]
Listen, our motto is, you lick it and we stick it in the body fuck.

[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:35.560]
Yeah, that's exactly. That's right.

[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.900]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:37.760]
Feel better.

[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:38.980]
Oh my God.

[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.780]
That's exactly how we start Tom Hopkins with Kenny, what he said.

[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:42.760]
Lick it and stick it.

[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.740]
That's the motto with the US Postal Service, baby.

[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.440]
And a stick it right inside your...

[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.000]
Inside your...

[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:48.520]
Back home, deep.

[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.360]
It's hard to do that with a cigar in your purse and your hand, too.

[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.460]
Dade County lines are open, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.040]
Pond 5, 60, on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.720]
Service in America, baby. It's an oxymoron.

[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.660]
You can't complain about the service in this country because there isn't any.

[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.640]
I said that on Dan Rather, how many years ago, about 100 years ago,

[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.040]
when I did that stupid interview,

[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.220]
and it's the same today only worse and gets worse by the minute.

[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.600]
And you people are working for the post office, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:19.200]
They delivered a mail in my neighborhood now 6, 15, 6, 30 at night,

[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.120]
midnight to a clock in the morning, whenever they get around to it.

[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.860]
You think Monica, you think the president's getting a lot of action?

[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.660]
God only knows what they're doing. I know God damn routes are routes.

[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:29.700]
They're tapping the route is what they're doing.

[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.800]
Here's a mobile and little Havana, hello.

[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.160]
Yeah, that's going on, buddy.

[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:34.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.020]
What the hell is that guy talking about the post office?

[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.160]
He said they suck and I said he was right.

[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.280]
They are the worst. I don't know what I'm up to.

[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:41.700]
I'm up to stick it. Yeah.

[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.500]
I bought a house about 2 years ago,

[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.860]
and the gentleman I bought it from,

[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.940]
he's still getting mail delivered to my house.

[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.460]
The guy's got to come by once a week.

[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.200]
He's been to all the post office.

[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.220]
He's called the postmaster general. He's called everybody.

[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:56.720]
He's called Bill Clinton and he's taking mail sent to my house.

[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.260]
How do you like that?

[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.560]
It's ridiculous.

[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.800]
And they still want to raise the price of stamps.

[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.360]
Right now, then, now that's going to be 34 cents in a few months.

[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.880]
They're going to keep raising it again and again and again.

[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.980]
And the service keeps getting worse.

[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.940]
How can it take 18 days? Like I said before,

[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.560]
if the mail was over there in sunrise and my old post office out there on Hyatus Road,

[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:19.200]
I could walk. I could walk it from there to where my new box is over there

[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.520]
and back to my house in less than 18 days.

[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.460]
It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous, buddy.

[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:25.780]
Anyways, I love your show.

[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:30.080]
I love your program on TV and George Par, your douchebag.

[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.420]
Okay. Okay, two open lines in day two and Broward.

[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.480]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.160]
10, 55, 5, 60, QM.

[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.620]
We've got Mark McGuire and the Cardinals.

[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.120]
Insane Lewis. The Marlins will be there.

[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.500]
Night then, of course, they're going to be here next week.

[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.880]
And that place will be Rockin' and Jammin'

[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.320]
and the chance of there being anybody in that stadium

[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:54.780]
if it weren't for Mark McGuire to see the pathetic Marlins and the Cardinals left of them.

[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.100]
And the Cardinals next week who are also having a bad year,

[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.020]
there would be nobody there next week.

[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.360]
You could have your own section except for Mark McGuire.

[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.060]
So let me say it again. I take great umberage.

[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.540]
I take great exception when any of these self-proclaimed experts get on the year,

[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.180]
most of whom don't have any idea what they're talking about.

[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.600]
And bap bap bap bap bap, start to try to pee on everybody's parade.

[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.960]
It's 11 o'clock at 5.60 WQM.

[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.700]
We made it all the way to 11 o'clock at a market of 96 points.

[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.760]
Thank God for that, but don't count it to two-fast.

[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.040]
Okay? Yesterday it got off to a big start.

[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.020]
Kind of disappointing, you know, it looks really, really grim.

[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.140]
And they got all these experts on there, but a beep, but a boop, but above now,

[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.020]
they all had a big frown on their face and out of single one of them got any idea

[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.000]
what they're talking about.

[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.080]
We have two open lines in date, 5.67.05.60,

[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.140]
POM 5.60 on the mobile one line.

[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.140]
Here's Dear Field Beach. Hello.

[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.480]
Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing, man?

[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:46.920]
Great. Um, listen, I haven't been able to catch your show on TV

[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.380]
because I got to damn DSF and I'm too lazy to put up an antenna, you know?

[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.120]
Yeah. But what about that time last night on A&E?

[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:55.880]
They had their investigative reports, you ever watch that show?

[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.400]
Sure, all the time. I love the head of.

[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.940]
Big fluff piece on it. I don't like Bill Curtis, but I love the shot.

[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.760]
I can't stand him. He's melodramatic for me.

[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:02.980]
Yeah, he's like, it's like a full craft.

[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.100]
They did a big fluff piece on Hillary last night.

[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.100]
Yeah. And it was so over a rock.

[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:09.800]
I already saw that. When?

[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.760]
That must be a repeat.

[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.860]
It must have been a repeat because they showed her, did they show the shots when she was young?

[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:20.300]
Do you understand why Chelsea has her hair the way? That's how Hillary looked when she was young.

[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:23.500]
She looked just like Chelsea. I looked at that and I said, oh my God.

[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:24.720]
Oh my God. She is as God.

[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.240]
One of the ugliest families ever.

[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.020]
Yeah. Next to the Carter's.

[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:32.920]
Yeah, and it was just, it was just the butt sucking like fluff piece and it was so overroddened or mad.

[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:33.740]
It was making me sick.

[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:37.060]
Well, she wouldn't do what the president wanted to do. That's the deal.

[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.560]
That's what Monica says. Right.

[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.400]
She wouldn't do what the president wanted, she wasn't into it.

[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.620]
You read that out of the star? Is that where it was coming from?

[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.440]
Of course. Where the hell did you get the real news?

[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.840]
Of course. You know, it's the truth.

[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.520]
The other thing I heard you talking a few weeks back, but I couldn't get through is, um...

[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.760]
She, and my wife does not satisfy my needs.

[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.740]
She's not interested in what I am.

[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.440]
He told Monica.

[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.160]
Basically, I don't know. I talk to a few people.

[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.480]
I consider her right-wing. I don't know if you consider her right-wing.

[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:06.040]
But you come across these people and they try and say, well, you know, if you're the president, you have to have ethics.

[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:07.340]
I said, give me a break, man.

[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.780]
What does ethics have to do with sex?

[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.720]
What does ethics have to do with being the president? What does being a politician?

[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.480]
And what are right-wingers know about ethics anyway?

[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:17.160]
Exactly. And it's like every president ever, it's just the damn media.

[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.980]
What the hell does this have to do with him running the country, his sexual exploits?

[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:25.680]
In fact, I was yesterday when I left here because we had the ball game on, which I wouldn't listen to when I'm totally left.

[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:30.420]
I punched over to La Daz Limbaugh, which I never listened to that cow, spewing his right-wing horsecraft.

[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:30.740]
Right.

[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:36.600]
And he was carrying on about how Clinton was trying to compare himself, you know, as Commander-achief to FDR and Eisenhower and this and that,

[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:40.780]
and about what great, you know, they didn't care about their image and they did this, they did that.

[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:45.400]
And I'm thinking to myself, yeah, they also screwed around. They both had mistresses just like Clinton, okay? So what's the difference?

[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.500]
Even when you tell them.

[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.400]
Even Nixon reportedly had mistresses.

[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.300]
Chinese mistresses, yes?

[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:54.640]
It's sickening. The other thing I wanted to tell you was, I don't know who coined that phrase, the dumbing of America, was it you?

[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.040]
Yeah.

[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.460]
I drive around here all day in South Florida.

[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:05.360]
And you say something to somebody, you're courteous, good mornings, and they look at you, they give you a dumpster, you're like a kid's animal.

[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:05.840]
Right.

[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.820]
And hostile. The word is, this is a hostile place.

[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.800]
Right. It's not as friendly as meeting a cage cobra.

[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:19.400]
The other thing too is that I'm driving up to work and I notice all the time that, like, for instance, there's a movie theater up here in Hillsboro Boulevard.

[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:19.720]
Yeah.

[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.460]
Now, there's a movie called The Negotiator. Have you heard of that movie?

[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:22.740]
No.

[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.020]
The Mozar Listick.

[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.620]
Yeah. And where's my favorite those Mozar Listicks?

[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.200]
Yeah, and I get letters as people.

[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.460]
The Floridians, dumb as dirt.

[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:31.020]
There you go.

[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.780]
This state makes me nauseous.

[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.840]
It's really disheartening and sickening that people are really stupid. They're surly.

[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:38.560]
Right.

[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.000]
And the whole country is anti-social, right?

[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:44.540]
About the Reigners Barbaric?

[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:45.260]
Yeah.

[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:46.040]
Subhuman.

[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.100]
And have a great day. Thank you.

[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.180]
Okay, you just summed up everything that I've been saying for the last, what, 200 years?

[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.140]
But hey, we'll get you a pal.

[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:55.160]
In spite of them, in spite of these assholes.

[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.400]
We have two open lines in date, two and brown.

[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:58.760]
Let's see what I'm saying. They're anti-social.

[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:02.540]
They're anti-socialized. They're all alone in a goddamn room.

[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.660]
I don't have no, I don't have any lesbians. I don't have any strippers.

[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.820]
I don't have any freaks. I don't have any goddamn damn dicks.

[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:10.700]
I'm just sitting here in a goddamn room looking to sit here in their gays.

[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.740]
She's in the verbal intercourse.

[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:15.640]
You know, this guy that called this morning, it makes you want to throw up your hands and just say,

[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:16.160]
what's he used?

[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:20.160]
This wasn't a little kid that called the worst team toward the end of their show this morning.

[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.640]
Asking his Roger Marist still alive.

[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:31.520]
On a sports show, a guy that's supposedly a sports fan is Roger Marist still alive.

[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.900]
Is Babe Ruth still alive? How's he doing?

[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.100]
How about Lou Gehrig? Is he doing pretty good?

[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:40.740]
Is he still the luckiest goddamn man on the face of the earth?

[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.640]
How's Ty Cod doing? How's Abe Lincoln today? He ever get over that headache?

[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:49.680]
Is Roger Marist still alive? Do these people read a newspaper?

[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:50.040]
No.

[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:53.300]
Do they watch anything besides the goddamn, do they read anything but the funny paper?

[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:53.500]
No.

[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:57.460]
Do they watch anything besides Jerry Springer on her goddamn TV set?

[00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:57.740]
No.

[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:02.520]
See, that's what kills me about these women that we have such a hard time getting to the women with this show.

[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:06.320]
Although we had a two-sharing woman in this last book, which considering for this station,

[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.580]
you know what they had in women, the rest of it like my new fractions?

[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.320]
Because women don't listen to a sports station.

[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:17.160]
So we did a two-share, which is quite a bit, but we always do a two-share, even on the other goddamn station.

[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.260]
Oh, my wife hates you, my girlfriend hates you.

[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.820]
What is that? They're all busy watching goddamn Jerry Springer.

[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.940]
There's a good intellectual show for you. There you go.

[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.300]
There's something in the air, there's something in the water here, man.

[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.620]
I still haven't figured. Here I am 600 years later, and I still haven't figured out what the hell it is.

[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.640]
Well, let's take this one with 600 question marks in Medley. Hello.

[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.740]
Yeah, hello, Neil. What's up?

[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:41.400]
Okay, so...

[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:46.680]
I'm going to tell you that I'm angry because where I work, they had to take out the radio where I listen to your show from 10 to 2

[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.800]
because customers are coming in complaining.

[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:52.140]
Oh, 10 to 9. That guy is still making his dinner.

[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:56.640]
Oh, now I spend, you know, $100 to get a nice play.

[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:57.900]
And then I'm supposed to be in the...

[00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:58.600]
You get a nice one.

[00:48:59.500 --> 00:48:59.820]
Sorry?

[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:01.660]
$100 to get a nice one.

[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:02.440]
Yeah.

[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:08.080]
Just to put it in the room, and I work at changing tires at a bird tire over on Bird Road, and they're coming in there.

[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.360]
Then I'm supposed to be in there, and they're going to...

[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.960]
Because they want to make sure you do the tire balance them correctly.

[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.440]
Well, kick their ass out of there. Tom, get their order out of it.

[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.920]
I do. They don't want the entire police.

[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:19.820]
They went to the manager, and now they got the radio to get up.

[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:22.580]
Now you're a show of sparing in the damn shop.

[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.480]
Well, quick the job. Go work in a real place. So, can you get off that bird?

[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.420]
We have two open lines, and day one and Broward.

[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.980]
5667-0560, pound 560 on a mobile one line.

[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.100]
What do you mean, you don't believe them?

[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:34.820]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello?

[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:35.980]
Hello?

[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:36.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:37.460]
Neo, hi.

[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:37.920]
Okay.

[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.120]
Listen, I work for the post office, offer.

[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:44.020]
Well, I apologize, then, that you have such a crappy place you work for.

[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:49.600]
Well, listen. Did you fill out form 1125?

[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.600]
Sir, I filled out the form.

[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.340]
Whatever the hell the form is, and I received back both in my old address at my house,

[00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:59.860]
and also in my new box, all those nice forms that we received this, and yadda yadda yadda.

[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.560]
I got all its all kosher and legal, and the mail has started coming.

[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.720]
So, there's no problem with form is filling out, sir.

[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:09.520]
The problem is with the snail, the snail-like pace of these service to the postal service.

[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:12.340]
But a lot of times people don't realize just how much work we have.

[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.600]
A lot of times we, we...

[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:17.960]
Sir, let me say it to you again.

[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:23.440]
When the mail comes in on Monday, I could walk it over from the my old post office on Hey,

[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.340]
this road to my new box where I got it.

[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.760]
I could walk it over there in less than 18 days.

[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:30.260]
Sir.

[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.780]
You're not happy with the service.

[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:33.240]
Would you be?

[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.820]
Would you like to wait 18 days for your mail to be transferred?

[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.400]
It's not like I moved to Missoula, Montana or somewhere.

[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:39.320]
I'm by...

[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.660]
But that's not unreasonable nowadays.

[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:42.820]
18 days?

[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.740]
But, I'm not sure, is that...

[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.300]
That's not an unreasonable amount.

[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.480]
And then, let me say it again.

[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:49.880]
Wait a minute.

[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:50.380]
Wait a minute.

[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:50.560]
Wait a minute.

[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.460]
Today is 18 days.

[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.360]
Just a minute, sir.

[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:53.680]
Today is 18 days.

[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:58.360]
But that doesn't mean today all of a sudden all the mail from the 7th of August is going to show up.

[00:50:58.680 --> 00:50:59.380]
You follow what I'm saying?

[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:00.400]
So, got on there a lot.

[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:00.700]
How many days?

[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.380]
Are the way we work, are...

[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:03.600]
Blah.

[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:04.780]
What, where's the...

[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.220]
We have up to 25 days.

[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.240]
Up to 25 days for what?

[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.360]
To get it there.

[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:09.960]
From...

[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.780]
That's almost a month.

[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.660]
But that's the way we work.

[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:14.920]
We have up to 25 days.

[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:15.300]
I could...

[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:17.880]
I could scrap the mail to my dog's ass.

[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.260]
I was a rubber band.

[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:23.140]
I could strap a package around my dog's ass, with with all that mail in there.

[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:27.600]
And he could walk from my the Ole Haidus Road over when I knew places in plantation.

[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.800]
And, in, uh... few hours.

[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:33.020]
But they give us up to 25 days for some places.

[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:33.420]
Why?

[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.220]
Are you that slow in daughtering?

[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.360]
You can't get the job done.

[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.920]
What are you guys doing over there?

[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:40.280]
No, because we're under dashed, so...

[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.100]
I don't know how that's.

[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:41.240]
Yeah.

[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:43.300]
I don't know why, because we're only paying 32 cents for a letter,

[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:47.400]
that we used to pay three cents for because that one you understand you know that's not

[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:52.700]
a priority once the mail goes from another party what is your priority getting late in

[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:56.260]
the back room there what is your priority over there at the post office you seem hostile

[00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:05.440]
and I'm not going to see a hostile I am hostile I seem hostile but I'm just not what is a

[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:10.380]
priority what is a priority that we have 25 days if we can do with you if that's not a

[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:15.260]
priority get in people there will be a lot of the priority sir answer my question what's

[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:19.500]
your priority no our priority to get the mail to you yeah but once it goes from a different

[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:25.700]
address we have up to 25 days depending on how much what let me tell you sir that blows that sucks

[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:32.440]
that's not really do get it within two or three days but sometimes it does go at 15 16 18 days

[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:38.380]
yeah we don't we don't like that but sometimes that happens why is that we we I mean we get a lot

[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:45.300]
of complaints people's electric bills and think I can understand yeah okay and but that's the

[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:49.300]
best we can do sometimes well why is that the best you can do are you playing well in the back

more about her and what kind of our character she is and what a what a piece of crap she is why

[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:42.900]
don't we hear anything about that the only thing we hear about her from the mainstream media is

[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:47.580]
about how we're supposed to feel so sorry for her and her life is tattered and insured and she's

[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:53.940]
trying to put her piece back together again but your horse craft open line is day two and

[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:19.260]
just moments ago exactly took only 500 days of what am I complaining about and that's the best they

[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:24.000]
can do if I give him twenty five dollars a letter he might be able to do it faster within two or three

[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:31.020]
days exactly sir you just it's just a nerve on a FedEx driver and we listen to you religiously

[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:36.260]
out here I love FedEx by the way airborne express sucks but I love FedEx okay and I've been working

[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:41.800]
with the company 13 years and we do a good job because we care about our customers right and

[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:45.560]
like this guy first he says well that's not our number one priority what is their number one

[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:51.820]
priority squeeze as much money out of us as they can that's the one the my post I have a good

[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:56.880]
relationship out here with my uh person who delivers the mail to my house yeah uh they're here

[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:03.320]
every day at the same time no problem oh that by me but that's the thing it's like sort of like

[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:08.480]
the 50 excuses he was trying to give you it boils down to like if the station that's close to

[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:13.180]
got a bad manager and they have everything all screwed up then you got to get screwed up service

[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:18.860]
well I got news for this station got a real bad manager uh your station too you're station two

[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:24.860]
yeah but that's the way I look at it you know if they don't have their stuff together and uh that

[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:28.340]
you're gonna I call up this bitch yesterday and she's giving me a song and a dance about what you

[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:33.180]
know I should consider myself lucky that I got any mail within the first ten to fourteen days

[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:37.120]
like I should go have a party and celebrate because I got a few little dribs and grabs a mail

[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:42.520]
in less than uh 200 days or something well you know that was an answer I couldn't believe it

[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:47.340]
they have an excuse for everything new so it's like today I got to envelope on my truck that's

[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:51.580]
got a bad address on it what I did was I called the dispatcher they called the recipient

[00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:56.980]
to correct the address and I'm gonna deliver it later on today unbelievable so they can't they just

[00:56:56.980 --> 00:57:01.580]
don't get it new well god we all love you out here god bless federal express they care so have a

[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:07.440]
great day yeah FedEx is great unfortunately certain companies uh switched over to airborne express

[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:14.120]
which blows by the way the big one yeah I had some of my plant tickets sent to me airborne express

[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:20.620]
a few weeks ago they lost the package so the company had a reissue the tickets incentive

[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:26.440]
FedEx which they were there the next day with FedEx but airborne Express bites they must be

[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:31.420]
related to the people who work at the post office yeah this is America today now this is the new

[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:36.380]
deal uh you expect service from us are you crazy this is the best we can do we're kind of slow

[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:40.600]
over here we're disorganized and we're understanding I don't want to hear sob stories I'd like to get my

[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:47.400]
mail sometime before they stick my fat pimply ass in the ground okay you jackass that was a class

[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:51.560]
that was a great call that that was the definitive call about the attitude about most people in

[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:58.760]
America they about service what do you expect them at some time like soon no I figure like after

[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:02.220]
I'm starting to and you know the best part of it is like for example if you get an electric bill

[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:07.220]
and you don't pay it or you like lose it and then how they send you that that kind of white envelope

[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:13.540]
and you know what you're saying when you get that one has to they're about ready to give you five

[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:18.140]
days they're going to shut off your electric well guess what if they do send you that when it's

[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:22.420]
still going to be the old address and you're still not going to get it for another 500 days

[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:30.880]
so thank you so much US Postal Service Man you guys blow and I'm lucky enough evidently there

[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:35.220]
will be in an area that they in a particular post office where they have they can't figure out

[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:40.440]
what their goddamn asses they got both hands on each other's ass but not on the goddamn US mail the

[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:45.440]

Lay my play on the radio

[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:09.200]
Lay my play on the radio

[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:14.360]
That is my one-one, it's my team, it's my team!

[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:21.280]
That is my team, right here on the dining foot, it's my team, I'm four, and it's all over

[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.800]
I'm just waiting for you to start your swings in there as long as you need to directly avoid way back, back, back, back, back, back,

[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:28.480]
It's a good vibe over those wrong runs

[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.260]
I'm glad that the mic they make it come out

[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:37.940]
Oh, what a catch, there's a lot more trying

[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:43.420]
Turn it up loud, as the difficult shoes are coming in by

[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:49.900]
And it's my team, right here on the radio

[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:54.340]
Lay my play on the radio

[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:59.240]
Lay my play on the radio

[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.020]
That's the day and the day

[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:08.040]
Lay my play on the radio

[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:17.800]
Lay my play on the radio

[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:18.900]
That's the day and the day

[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:22.720]
It is going, it is going, it is going!

[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.620]
Oh yeah, number nine, Roger Mayerst, thank you for your help

[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:30.800]
Two people out there in an area former, the name of who it was, Roger Mayerst, number nine

[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.460]
Like the day that Mel Allen died, I come out here the next day

[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.380]
Who? What?

[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:40.100]
Like Ralph Kiner when I was talking about him last week, Ralph Kiner was like, well, well, he was, uh, exactly

[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:48.140]
What? It's all the, these people must all be related to that Lenny kid that's doing those tags on the spot

[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:51.660]
Yeah, this is supposed to be a radio station

[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:56.780]
If you think that in a radio station or a TV station, you'd have people if you're going to be put them on the ear

[01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:00.520]
Who can speak, who can articulate, who can be understood

[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.500]
No wonder we're getting 75 bucks to pop out of Marlon Games

[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:07.680]
We've probably got the retards doing the spots in the Marlon Games, two no doubt

[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.120]
Who did you think?

[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:15.720]
No, I don't, you sound like Ralph Kiner, maybe he also had the Tinkerbells palsy over there that Lenny kid

[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:20.520]
We got bunch of kids at your feet, you can't speak, you mean you ain't?

[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.020]
Yeah, Reno, Roger Mayerst, he was number nine

[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:30.500]
What kind of a play, you know, if our program, the higher program director who wasn't so visually diddling himself all the time,

[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:34.440]
that put people on, of course the problem is you don't want to pay anybody, that's another problem too

[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:37.180]
So we get a bunch of five-year-old kids in here, who can't speak?

[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:41.040]
Welcome to all four three, you, you and you, Tanger, is that three?

[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.760]
Okay, I work, we are cheap

[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:52.260]
Oh my god, we have an open line a day two and abroward, 567, 0560, 0560 on the mobile one line

[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:54.120]
Homestead, hello

[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.320]
Good morning

[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.340]
Yes sir, how are you?

[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.240]
Great, I'm totally impressed that you mentioned airborne expressed

[01:07:59.240 --> 01:07:59.980]
Yes sir

[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:06.380]
About a thousand years ago when they first started, they were great because there was a bunch of ex-servicemen that started the company up

[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:07.560]
And they were the best

[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:12.960]
And then a million, they sold the company or some crap down on a semi-elf took it over

[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:18.320]
And they became the worst, the business I was in, we got to the point where we had to specify shipments

[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:23.020]
Not to go airborne, they'd be refused, took them days to get the product away

[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:23.200]
Yeah

[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.420]
It was incredible

[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:30.800]
And I'm going to tell you the worst part of it is big companies like American Express, which I do all my business with their travel service

[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.780]
They used to use FedEx never ever had a problem

[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:36.980]
And now they've switched over to airborne express for whatever reason I don't know

[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:43.320]
And had so many problems and every time I call an American Express they say, oh you have no idea how many complaints we're getting and we're psychotic

[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:44.200]
And we don't know what to do

[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:50.480]
And like I said last time I had a mistake, airborne express lost my plane tickets and they had to reissue new ones and set them FedEx

[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.540]
And I got them the very next day

[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:54.160]
Well airborne is working on the chief, that's why we're about to pick up their service

[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.500]
FedEx, just unbelievable

[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:57.560]
FedEx is absolutely the best

[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:01.780]
Second thing, Ken Star and his little game he's playing here

[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:04.080]
This came up through yesterday I was listening to the show

[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:09.620]
And he were reading that news release or whatever the hell it was about Monica and Bill and everything

[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.680]
What's up with his leaks?

[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.300]
This is like not legal

[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.860]
Of course it's not legal

[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:17.880]
There's every single thing that was said

[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:23.100]
Obviously there was to discuss you know this is part of her testimony that she was going in all this graphic crap

[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.740]
And no matter what it is that said in front of a grand jury it leaks out again

[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:31.820]
Including when she testified last Thursday again it was looking out that morning what she was going to say

[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.200]
Exactly, that's like against the law

[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.900]
Yeah well, so Ken Star was with the law

[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:37.080]
He'd be the law

[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.240]
He keeps a good job going there

[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.220]
Okay I'm a great guy but

[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:44.240]
Okay, okay two lines I guess we're going to be doing a lot of music of this week

[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.040]
Okay see I was in a state of euphoria which is definitely not Florida

[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.140]
Thinking man we got a lick

[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:53.740]
We're almost to that magic day that's the demarcation point Labor Day

[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:57.220]
When finally of course George is going to be doing a show on that day he locks out

[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.860]
You'll be flooded with call

[01:09:58.860 --> 01:09:59.760]
Oh yeah that's right

[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:02.840]
You will, you'll be flooded with calls even though it's a Monday and it's a holiday

[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.080]
Everybody's going to be out there doing their thing

[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.440]
They're going to be grilling it

[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:07.820]
And there we need to

[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.160]
Two open lines and day two and Broward any interest today any interest at all today?

[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:13.480]
No

[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.300]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.380]
Palm 5 60 on the mobile one line

[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.660]
Any women out there going to speak towards today?

[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:19.920]
No

[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:23.440]
We had that one bring nice 200-year-old lady to start the show this morning in Hellendale

[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.980]
And she turned out to be sensational

[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.900]
Compared to you other women out there who have got lock jaw

[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:29.880]
Maybe too many monocles out there, huh?

[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.660]
Maybe that's the problem they got lock jaw

[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.560]
Good got all mighty as managed would say

[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.900]
By the way don't forget manage will be here from two to six this afternoon and got only knows what he's going to be saying

[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:45.480]
Because you know the way it works in this business if you're an X-Jock

[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.720]
Not only do you get all the jobs now for your next job

[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.700]
But you can go on here and say whatever you want

[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:53.520]
If you're just like a real broadcaster all over we're listening on every word we're hanging

[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.080]
Waiting for you to make the big slip up

[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.020]
But if you're an X-Jock

[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:57.500]
Oh yeah we're boring

[01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.580]
We used to talk about pussy

[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:01.140]
We talk about stock now

[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:04.680]
You know you just get old artsy fartsy

[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.800]
And it's no fun anymore

[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:12.060]
It's true we used to talk about good bodies and big t**s and you know the fun stuff

[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.060]
And you'll be hearing a lot more of that two to six today

[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:14.580]
Oh right

[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.320]
You betcha

[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:17.240]
23 to eight

[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:17.460]
No

[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.200]
Is he doing anything?

[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:18.480]
No

[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:22.260]
I just mentioned that since you asked who might be getting the trade

[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:26.160]
See if you're related if you're part of a big mishpaka here

[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:28.400]
Then you get all kinds of incestuous good stuff

[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.100]
But if you're on the outside of that then you have to scream and jump up and down

[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.100]
And you still don't get it

[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:34.940]
How's that bonus George ever get his bonus yet?

[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:35.180]
No

[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:35.800]
For the winter book?

[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:36.000]
No

[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.060]
For the good book?

[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:39.400]
No

[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.260]
You know what the good book says?

[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:46.020]
Okay we look we hit them all filled up there for just a few seconds and they mostly went away

[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:47.340]
Because they had nothing to say anyway

[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:50.260]
Here's a mobile in a grove hello

[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:52.380]
Well I'm in Miami now

[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.300]
Airborne express I've had a lot of problems with them

[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.940]
They even lost my cellular phone

[01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:58.660]
Did they really?

[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.740]
How did they get your cellular phone?

[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:01.580]
Pardon?

[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:02.580]
How did they get that?

[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:10.220]
I was having a ship from I had a problem with the phone and they were shipping it for a new phone because my old phone died

[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:13.520]
And you had your cell phone shipped by airborne express?

[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.440]
Oh my God

[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:15.880]
Huh?

[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:17.520]
The cellular company did

[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.000]
Yeah

[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:21.580]
But yeah I've had no problems with FedEx

[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:22.480]
What's the wall?

[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.980]
FedEx is like God FedEx is great

[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:27.540]
There is dependable is the weather in Anchorage, Alaska

[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:29.260]
You know exactly what it's going to be

[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:33.380]
And UPS is pretty good once in a while I have a minor problem but they take care of it immediately

[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:33.760]
Yeah

[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.640]
But the post office you'll get this one out of the post office

[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.740]
The post office is about four blocks from me

[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:44.380]
And they could not get the mail right I was getting everyone else's mail in my apartment complex

[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.720]
And they were screwing my mail up

[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.980]
Everyone else was getting my mail for about 10 o'clock at night

[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:52.000]
I had someone come over and bang on my door and say is this your mail?

[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.480]
And then when I went to go set up a post office box

[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.540]
Which was approximately maybe 10, 12 blocks away

[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:03.680]
It took three and a half weeks to get a mail less than 15 blocks

[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.000]
Three and a half weeks

[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.800]
To get mail 15 blocks

[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:10.640]
I'm going to tell you something sir if it takes them three and a half weeks for them to get me the rest of my mail

[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.960]
Which is 95% which I haven't received yet

[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:19.260]
I'm going to go over there to the sunrise post office and lay down Stark naked in the middle of the guy to influence start making gurgling noises

[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:21.740]
Well I'm going to go over there and do a big thing

[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:23.560]
In fact I'm going to take my both dogs over there

[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:26.460]
We're all three of us going to head right on the floor in the middle of that post office

[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:28.320]
We'll take a fat yo with his camera over there

[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.620]
And the problem that I had was

[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.240]
You know I was like my copies of out

[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.800]
They were getting my copies of the advocate

[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.640]
Oh my goodness, they're getting the bag stuff

[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.740]
His neck is probably getting off on a tuna round

[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:42.820]
And half the time I would notice that the pages were dog geared

[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:46.540]
So you know what they say about some of those mail carriers

[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:50.080]
So most of those mail carriers except my friend Rick

[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.300]
In fact he's the only straight my postal guy that I know

[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:55.460]
He's probably the only straight postal guy

[01:13:55.460 --> 01:14:00.080]
Mayor Patwood and Greg got it well I guess it's a minority now they're going to have a code of okay pal good luck to you but you're

[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.060]
Okay two open lines in day two and powered

[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:04.840]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.020]
Palm 5 60 on the mobile one line

[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:10.220]
Who is the hell is Roger Mara anyway that's what these people want to know

[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:11.200]
Old number nine

[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:12.800]
They don't want to know

[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.680]
What do you mean?

[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:16.400]
What does that mean?

[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.360]
This is supposed to be a sports station

[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:23.080]
And when Gildey gets on there shooting up see there's nothing worse than having little punks on the air

[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:29.060]
Talking about the stuff that they maybe maybe right about in a book or maybe somebody told them grandpa told them about it sitting them on their

[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:31.660]
Knee when they were like three years old about two years ago

[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.840]
Because they know what they're talking about

[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.280]
And here's and and it's one thing not to know what you're talking about

[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.740]
But when you're loud and shrill like Gildey don't know what you're talking about

[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:44.680]
It's just like rubbing salt in your womb is what it's like

[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.800]
And you know and of course to your audience of this station they're like on an equal par

[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.720]
You know like that guy who is used to live guys older than my friends the older than I am

[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:58.220]
Which is really old and this guy's calling in the series Roger Mara still alive

[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:02.060]
Read a goddamn newspaper once in your life sir pick up a book

[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.520]
Here's a mobile in Miami hello

[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.660]
Yeah I eat on you okay sir

[01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:10.980]
I'm calling you from Miami one of make two questions

[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:14.220]
One question was the thing about the post-align question statement

[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:21.120]
I had the same problem as you and I took me around five to six weeks before I actually started getting all my mail five to six weeks

[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:25.960]
Five to six weeks get a lot of my bills laid I had to call up the company and tell me

[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:29.900]
There's what's going on that you know of course I don't care about that but we want their money

[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.760]
Right and there's nothing you can do about it even

[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:36.320]
It's quite clear then you're great to get your mail and then get it to you

[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.520]
Isn't that great isn't that the American way?

[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:42.940]
And we bet you much you get a couple of this rum on the post and the future also probably

[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:45.400]
Uh-huh we're just deep six all your mail which is even worse

[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.780]
Yeah okay Eric did you play backpipes for a couple of guys at 60?

[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.600]
I'll work on them I appreciate

[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.080]
I'll get out the kilts have a great day sir good luck to us

[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.920]
Yeah now that over there to sunrise post office probably got some wise answers up there

[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:02.420]
Oh yeah well we're really going to fifth symbol you know stick it in the goddamn dumpster somewhere

[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:05.480]
Thank you so much for your great service and have an eye stay too by the way

[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.380]
Over there on the hiatus road

[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.220]
Right off of uh whatever there of Oakland

[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.380]
We have two open lines in date 5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:17.140]
Pond 5 60 on the mobile one line

[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:18.660]
Tamara hello

[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.140]
Hey how you doing now?

[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:25.600]
Okay sir I just want to ask you I was uh I heard that you know you don't have any interest in the dolphins anymore

[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.140]
That's true

[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:26.820]
That is correct

[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:29.280]
But what about the greatest quarterback in NFL history?

[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:30.680]
Who's that?

[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:31.520]
Dan Marino

[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.600]
No he's not the greatest quarterback in NFL history

[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.620]
That even close

[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:36.100]
Just because you didn't want a superboard?

[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:37.940]
No because he's not the greatest quarterback in NFL

[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:41.060]
And if I don't have any interest in the dolphins why would I want to discuss Dan Marino with you?

[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.200]
Whether he's the greatest or not?

[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:44.240]
Well you know he has the points of the dolphins

[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:46.680]
So who cares if I let me say it again if I don't care about the dolphins

[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.120]
Why do I care about Dan Marino who listen to the show by the way?

[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:49.840]
Why do I care?

[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.040]
You don't care do you care?

[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.120]
You don't care about Dan Marino?

[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.080]
What what more didn't you understand?

[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:55.780]
What more don't you understand?

[01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:57.020]
Do I have to spell it out for you?

[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:58.600]
Do you come in with what we're not spell it for you?

[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:00.620]
As in G-O-O-D-B-Y-E

[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.480]
We have two open lines in day one and Broward

[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:04.920]
5 6 7 0 5 6 8

[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.540]
5 5 6 8 on a mobile one line

[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:09.120]
And I especially don't care about exhibition football games

[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.480]
Or exhibition baseball games

[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:11.780]
Or exhibition hockey games

[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.180]
Or exhibition any games

[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:16.020]
Because they're boring and they mean nothing

[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:18.480]
And because it's the dog days of the summertime

[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.200]
And the people on the station have to fill up the other 20 hours today

[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:24.320]
And you bozos out there don't know anything else except to talk about football

[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.040]
And Tim Bowen's get a good deal and did this one do that

[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:30.460]
And I'll come up there still doing the same old stuff

[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:33.240]
They're exhibition games they don't mean a god damn thing

[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.120]
They mean nothing

[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:36.180]
Absolutely nothing

[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.720]
Wait until the first regular season games start

[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:42.160]
And then maybe I might have some interest or have something to say about it

[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.500]
But for exhibition games

[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:46.560]
The list of these people wasting our after our talking crap

[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.560]
Because that's what it is

[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:53.040]
There would be like my comment on here talking about how the panthers looking at first exhibition games

[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.660]
There would be a bunch of crap

[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:55.360]
That's right

[01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:59.600]
And based on what I'm seeing the regular season games are probably going to be a bunch of crap

[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.460]
But at least a nice new arena anyway

[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:02.460]
God

[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:06.400]
Get a life, get a god damn a hobby

[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:10.120]
Get a police okay, get an advisor, get a spiritual counselor

[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.780]
Call up 12 gripping and get your palm bread or something

[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:14.580]
Do something to kill some time

[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:17.440]
His damn arena of the great event

[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:21.000]
And that's just a Danny Moreno this and Danny Moreno that and Jimmy Johnson did this

[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.740]
And don't you love the okay great

[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.640]
Go e-lope with all three of them okay

[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:28.460]
Here's a mobile and sunrise hello

[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:29.620]
Hey Neil

[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:30.360]
Yes sir

[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.940]
Speaking of that I'm just now driving by your winter home right now

[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:35.980]
My winter home?

[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.020]
Yeah the arena

[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:37.700]
Yeah

[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.600]
That's my winter home

[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:42.420]
Well you know you're there almost every night during the hockey season

[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:43.940]
No I'm not, you'll be here every night

[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:46.960]
Well I'm not even going to be there opening night

[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:47.780]
I'm going to be out of town

[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:49.160]
I'll be there when I'm in town

[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.540]
Okay well then

[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:53.080]
I'm going to be playing the fact that it's close is nice and the fact that they buy me my tickets

[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.640]
It's right at center ises even nice too

[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.300]
But I'm not going to change my life because I got a hockey team

[01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:59.880]
A crappy hockey team going to be playing right up the street there

[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.920]
It's very nice and it's going to be a beautiful place

[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.660]
But it's still a Wayne thing don't you understand sir

[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:09.080]
Yes sir I do it and it's so far we haven't seen one bit of evidence

[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:12.620]
That anything positive is going to happen that we're going to have any changes

[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:15.440]
Hey Neil I used to work here four years ago

[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.400]
And I used to go offload containers for Emory

[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.120]
And airborne express

[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:26.180]
And I would take the containers off the airplane and I would deliver them into the warehouse there

[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.860]
Where they would sort the packages

[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:33.540]
And I would see them take IBM computers and A's, Louis, this is yours

[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:36.500]
And they would play it right across the whole dock

[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:41.400]
Yeah I mean just rolling over I can imagine what it looked like when it got to the customer

[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:44.720]
And probably looks like a beat up crappy old IBM computer

[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.100]
That was one brand new and very nice

[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:49.540]
Yeah I know it was unbelievable the way they would do things over there

[01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:52.840]
They would just take boxes and just play them from one other warehouse to the other

[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.480]
They had no like conveyor system at that time or whatever

[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.540]
It was beautiful areas

[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:59.780]
Well it's like watching, do you ever watch the guys when they load the luggage on a plane

[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:02.020]
When you're sitting there and you're watching, you're looking out the window

[01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.280]
And they're loading the last of the luggage on a plane

[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.400]
Hey and a people in the round and tossing it and twisting it and yanking it and the luggage too

[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.000]
And of course it's your bag

[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.100]
Well no sir, it's not my bag I don't check luggage on planes

[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:16.960]
Ever, ever, ever, ever I have a drone, I carry on

[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:19.300]
That's right, I carry on a lot

[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:20.700]
Okay have a great day, good night here

[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:22.940]
I carry on a lot, that's right, a few people

[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:26.820]
You know I get a big kick out of these people to get on planes in fact they make me nauseous

[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:28.980]
And they're taking all their life of the lungs

[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:33.420]
The whole house, they clean up their whole, we're going away for you know a whole weekend, three day weekend

[01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:38.260]
Yeah, so what are you taking 50,000 pounds of crap for you

[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:43.680]
They got throws and arrows and guns and slingshots and baseball bats and canoes

[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.700]
And they're all, of course it's all carry on

[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:47.220]
Of course

[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:50.980]
What are these people thinking about crazy people?

[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:52.260]
But you might need that stuff

[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:55.560]
Yeah right, especially the, if they're getting on my plane

[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.600]
Here's a mobile and West Bomb Beach hello

Great job

[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.120]
Okay pal, have a great life

[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:18.520]
See ya

[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:24.240]
Two open lines in Dave County 56670560, pound 560 on the mobile one line

[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:29.540]
Oh I see I watch in them flipping the channels last night because I do not watch channel thin news ever, ever

[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:34.480]
And I see a familiar face on air as I'm doing my channel surfing was about 625

[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.720]
And who was it?

[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:41.680]
Mark Benson of Citizens of Dave United going way back in those old early days talk about one dimensional people

[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:46.620]
And he's talking about thank God that David Lawrence is leaving because the hero that I was a bilingual thing here

[01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:50.200]
He's bringing up that old Citizens of Dave United bilingual crap all over again

[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:52.960]
Mark Benson, he and ME Schaefer

[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:58.080]
The same old tired me or the over and over again

[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:00.940]
I couldn't believe it

[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:07.520]
One dimensional people just talking to China with the same stupid thing beating it over the head forever and ever

[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:11.820]
And I hate to break the news to you but if you open up your sports page this morning, Mark

[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.500]
You'll discover the channel 4 is going to be broadcasting

[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:17.240]
Fordolphin Games this season in Espanol

[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:17.620]
Oh

[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:21.420]
And you like that that's right if you have your SAP on your TV set if you're a SAP

[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:24.860]
Of course if you speak English you can be able to watch it in English

[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:27.880]
That's a good news for you Mark but I'm sure you're going to be foaming at them out

[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:30.540]
That they're going to be televising 4dolphin Games in Espanol

[01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:34.300]
And of course if you want you can listen to it on WCMQ and Espanol anyway

[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:38.540]
Thanks to IOD being so goddamn stupid as they were years ago to let them do that

[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:40.780]
Wasn't that a nice go on air Bob Neil

[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.760]
Yeah the cos broadcasting people man

[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:46.620]
That was over they had the exclusive right to the dolphins

[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:49.540]
They used to get 10 and 15 shares on Sunday with the Dolphin Games

[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.920]
WIOD oh I hate that station

[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:55.580]
All of a sudden they said well okay we'll let the CMQ alert broadcast it in Spanish

[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:59.580]
We won't lose any audience that way but I'm being all of a sudden the tens went to eights and went to five

[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:00.700]
Hey where did everybody go?

[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.980]
No speaking in English baby

[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.400]
Let's go to a camera hello

[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.940]
Hey how you doing today sir?

[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:11.840]
Yeah I thought you were going to lose it when I heard Goldie said the FDA is the federal drug

[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:12.900]
The federal drug administrator

[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.540]
Here's a little punk who's about 10 years old with a brain-assizable ball bearing

[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:21.580]
And they put him on a radio and the excuses even without an annoying voice the excuse as well

[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:25.100]
He's got a lot of credibility you know I got credibility. He's a puss

[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:29.940]
I hear those three guys and it's I remind me of the Fox thing that they do with Pat Somerow

[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:34.020]
John Madden and who's the other character they have?

[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:37.780]
They've been turned in there. They really need Matt Millenistra personality Matt Millenist

[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.700]
They really need three guys to do a broadcast

[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:43.760]
They ruined the time good I mean okay you know what's his name in the morning?

[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:49.200]
The farmers and Joe Rose no they're okay but with Goldie and there's Goldies another Matt Millen

[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:53.100]
And that's a shot that's a real shot at Matt Millen

[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:57.660]
Oh I'm at Matt Millenistra. I'm glad Millen comes over here and beats the crap out of Goldie just because you said that

[01:23:57.660 --> 01:24:00.980]
Okay good I'm waiting for Joe Rose to beat the crap out of Goldie one of these days

[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:03.020]
He probably will. Oh yeah he keeps calling a big hit

[01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:07.420]
He'll bring his brother in line. Oh boy and Marath number nine

[01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:10.000]
Yeah we already got it. Before I leave but thank you so much

[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.260]
You know who's ahead of Martin Dwyer and the whole run rate right?

[01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:19.060]
In a national in a national league Ralph Keiner hit 54

[01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:22.780]
Nobody knows Ralph Keiner here. I know that he hit 54 1949

[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:26.960]
Nobody knows how he liked that. I told you the year that he did it. I know you're the maverin

[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:28.640]
Okay. But nobody knows Ralph Keiner here right?

[01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:32.640]
No they don't know they don't know anything here at least they're consistent. Do you think they know Lindsay nothing?

[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:36.720]
No they don't. They're probably wearing his old suits. Have a great day.

[01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:41.000]
They don't know from nothing. These people are off from New York male Alan dies. Who's male Alan?

[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:47.840]
Ralph Keiner's got a bad day. Who's the Ralph Keiner? Lindsay Nelson. I mean these guys only did the Met's games for like 6000 years

[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.960]
And then I was out here saying that I thought Bob Murphy was dead since I don't live in New York anymore

[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:57.660]
And I was only praying and we would leave it up to Hank had to be the one to tell me that Bob Murphy is still alive

[01:24:57.660 --> 01:25:01.940]
These New Yorkers hey everything can maybe find like one of those small dishes you know

[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:07.140]
Go to a plants TV depot or God forbid someplace else and getting a small satellite dish

[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:12.120]
So you can actually have some contact with the outside with the real world which this definitely is not

[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:21.640]
Man oh man if I didn't have my two not just one but if I didn't have my big dish my small dish my milky can my flesh dishes

[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:27.200]
I don't know what the hell I would do and it's goddamn town because it's the only contact you got with the real world

[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.260]
Unless you get on a plane and go there which is not here

[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:35.460]
One open line and day one and Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:39.600]
Pond 5 60 on the mobile one line we're talking about the great sports casters of all time

[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:43.380]
Yeah that's another thing these people don't know from the sports casters

[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.780]
Even on the sports segments of this station it is not a top of you I mean I've heard people try to bring it up

[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:51.100]
They they know nothing they haven't got a clue

[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:56.040]
They think the scooter is a great sports casters that's their idea of a great sport the scooter

[01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:01.360]
Four minutes till noon at 5 60 WQ I am

[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:09.040]
Which is not my wife Filipino and we listen to you at a whammy and my ammy

[01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:13.380]
And years ago you listen to what are you watching?

[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:17.860]
Well we want the truth of the matter is whammy and my ammy when I was a little boy

[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:22.020]
I was like 13 or 5 years between 5 and 13

[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:25.300]
Whammy was a radio station when I was a little boy

[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:30.940]
Yeah whammy and my ammy was like on the same dial near 5 60

[01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:35.100]
Check it out when I was a little boy what comes around goes around

[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:39.200]
And before I heard about the Cuban and say I was a little boy like 5 years old

[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.920]
And then all this then they put on radio station that brought in Spanish

[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.700]
Then I started hearing Spanish was to me was amazing

[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:54.300]
Yeah I said what is I'm like and I was all the time I started learning about the stuff

[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:57.640]
Yeah and all of a sudden I heard the Spanish words and they say

[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:03.000]
The radio stations come over from Cuba as a little boy I was amazed

[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.460]
The whammy and my ammy was a radio station when I was a right now

[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:11.940]
What does that mean I'm listening to all these words but what does it mean?

[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.020]
Whammy? Okay thank you

[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:17.580]
Okay we have an open line and date 5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:21.640]
Palm 5 60 on the 18 2 wireless line what did he say he heard a bunch of Cuban words

[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:25.500]
And then all of a sudden his brain that became like it is today is functional

[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.000]
That was it in Espanol

[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:30.460]
Here is a fort water deal hello

[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:32.180]
It's me it's you

[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:32.700]
That's me

[01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:37.420]
Oh it's tough I got a mailbox in one of the larger substations

[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:38.080]
Yes sir

[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:40.900]
Constantly dropping mail in the wrong box

[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:48.460]
So instead of asking the clerks to please do their job they cut a hole and put a new mail drop in

[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:54.680]
They got to sign up as the cheese customers if you do us a favor and drop your misdirected mail into this shop

[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:57.460]
Oh very good so in other words we know we're going to be screwing up all the time

[01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:01.000]
So the mail isn't here is please put it back in here so we can maybe get in somebody or where it belongs

[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.160]
Yeah and bear with it

[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.000]
Oh God

[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.880]
You know what I want to thank a lot of you you're great

[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:05.700]
Thanks for the good news

[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:09.740]
There you go probably the people are working the post office the average IQ was in a minus column now

[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:12.680]
With all due respect to about you know there's a small percentage of them

[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:17.060]
We're very nice people and very articulate and very bright and have been in there too long to what change now

[01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:18.040]
I guess do anything else

[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.280]
But boy the kind of people that they're hiring now

[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:26.140]
Just like when you call one of these numbers to get information from like maybe one of your credit cards

[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:28.100]
Or you call for a service they're just about anywhere

[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:30.480]
I don't want to start talking minority stuff now

[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.380]
I don't want to be picking on minorities because there's nothing wrong with minorities

[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:39.140]
If they're qualified for the job and they got an IQ bigger than their big toe or little toe or big foot

[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:42.300]
But most of them sound like big foot

[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.660]
Oh God that's America today

[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:50.800]
This is what happened you can thank all these guy named bleeding heart phony limousine liberals which I was never won by the way I was

[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:51.420]
Yes I was

[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:56.160]
I say forget about all that crap higher people that are qualified to do the job

[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.620]
I want a concept huh

[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:05.600]
Which of course at this place in WQA they would eliminate like 80% of the people out the door there'd be a procession right out the goddamn door

[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:06.460]
See ya

[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:12.900]
Oh yeah see if the house this weekend because they're all related of course you know they're part of the family part of the mishpaka

[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:18.000]
No

[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:21.780]
When you know they had that problem there on a plane

[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:24.820]
Here's a mobile in Miami hello

[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:27.120]
Hey Neil, what's that side of this?

[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:27.860]
And back to you

[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:29.860]
Neil they all boils down to

[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:30.520]
Well how do you do

[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.880]
The devil service

[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:32.520]
Yeah

[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.760]
The devil service

[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:37.440]
Neil I heard you talking to my channel ten you know we're surfing the channel there on Sunday

[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:37.900]
Yeah

[01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:39.660]
We thought Kelly Mitchell there

[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:45.440]
Kelly Mitchell is now a channel ten that's correct and they still will not tell us the real reason why she got canned from seven

[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:46.820]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:50.260]
I guess part of the servant deal was that she wouldn't explain what really happened

[01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:52.520]
All right

[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:56.620]
Okay I think she caught Brian Andrews and the paper boy in the back room like Stark naked

[01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:59.540]
And that was then she threatened to go on the air with it

[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:01.920]
And they said get out of here Kelly just keep it all quiet

[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:02.940]
Is that what it was?

[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.260]
The paper delivery boy?

[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:05.300]
Or was it Craig Steve?

[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:06.340]
Who was it?

[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:08.240]
He's not there anymore is he?

[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:10.120]
Don't see him no more in channel seven

[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:10.980]
We've been in a long time now

[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:13.300]
Yeah Craig Steve and he must be back on his delivery route

[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:17.340]

[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:25.140]
Dan Stewart, oh you'll never guess who was doing the news?

[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:28.220]
I was listening to Rick and Suds on a Friday afternoon driving out of here

[01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:30.580]
Which I haven't heard them in a Koonz age

[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.000]
You'll never ever guess who's doing the news on their show do you know?

[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:42.080]
One of the most anxious people to ever darken the door at the Pax Nio D

[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:45.180]
Who was working on weekends fancy themselves as a radio talk host

[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:48.000]
Who used to be on with Tanner in the morning years ago?

[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:48.660]

[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:50.800]

Jim really he's the newsman now. Oh yeah, we're working done

[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:59.220]
And poor Rick Rana, I thought Rick was gonna bust a gun

[01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:03.540]
He was just begging for calls and I thought to myself, oh now I feel so much better

[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:05.660]
Now I know it's not just me and then this morning people

[01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:09.340]
People was threatening to blow his brains out on here if nobody would call and they still wouldn't call it

[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.020]
Didn't do it dammit

[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:16.780]
But it's just that was bizarre John M and Jim really

[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:20.880]
Not to mention of course William and Ben Pupick, Cronkite's a turd

[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:25.680]

[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.540]

[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:55.080]

[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:57.000]
