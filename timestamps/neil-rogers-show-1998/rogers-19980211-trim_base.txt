[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900]
You know that yeah, I know that last night when you were probably home you

[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.900]
There's thinking what am I gonna do to boost my little pathetic show?

[00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.320]
Yeah, you probably my pathetic show that my pathetic show that the guy who's on the phone

I'll listen to every day right? I said my pathetic show that you listen to every day

[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.800]
No, no, but don't cut me off. No, no, just just I'm not cutting you off

[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.200]
But I'm having a conversation. Why do you why does some of you people just like you've got blinders on like you can't hear what

[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.340]
I'm saying to you you listen to this show every day. Why don't you admit that?

[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.180]
I'm gonna show every day. I'm gonna make them you want

[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.720]
I'm gonna make them what does that have to do with it? What what has to do with it?

[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.280]
So how you know how do you know about the show if you don't listen to it?

[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.420]
Oh, I've been

[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.740]
I'm flipping my flippin' shadows on

[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.680]
You've been flipping it. You sound like you sound like you've been flipping it

[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.840]
Hey, wait, what I want to say? What did you want to say sir?

[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.700]
What did you want to say? How many times are you gonna repeat that? What did you want to say?

[00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:04.060]
I want to say that jerk chicken and jerk pork is a season that needs unlike the restaurant that you go to where you have to dump on your

[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.720]
spa, your black pepper to get a taste

[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.960]
We we we we we thrown it on me and we

[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.340]
Yeah

[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.800]
What does that have to do with the price of peanuts? What does that mean?

[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.740]
Sir, I have a suggestion for you listening sir

[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.640]
Yeah, okay, I was gonna come to jerk pork, but I think he already is I certainly my meat

[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.880]
Oh, I think I'm back right and he never my pathetic show

[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.240]
I'm gonna goose up my reign like I I invented this massive crowd that we had on the roads last night

[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.320]
And I was just salivating. I was just sitting there forming at the mouth

[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.960]
Oh, this is gonna make great material tomorrow. Right the stress level on a scale of one was was

[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.820]
Infinity, okay? That's how bad it was just praying that maybe eventually sometime before next sockets

[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.340]
We might wind up at the arena get to see the damn hockey game

[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.560]
But I just invented it and I just am an evil person who may occasionally jerk pork

[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.160]
Yeah, hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, listen

[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.620]
I hear you talk a lot about your rating and I've listened to your show now for a couple weeks and

[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.840]
And you don't like it and you're still listening well, I'll tell you the truth

[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.880]
I mean it's the same old stick every day

[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.200]
Yeah, so I don't know why you're listening for three weeks

[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.000]
I don't want to call up and critique and keep talking and not take a breath

[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.340]
You want to have a conversation or do you want to make a speech? I just want to say that you want to make a speech

[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.420]
You do want to have a conversation? Let's have a conversation. I'm listening

[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.720]
You have you talk about your ratings, but let's face her

[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.220]
I have never talked about ratings because I don't have any ratings on this station

[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.380]
That's because I haven't been here long a couple weeks ago

[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.160]
I heard you say you got the early returns or something was bad did not those were ratings for the rest of the station

[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.040]
They were not ratings on this show because the ratings for this show didn't start to the 8th of January

[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.120]
And we won't have those for another two or three weeks

[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.060]
So you're you're miss your miss can't screwing if I can use that term what I said

[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.180]
But the reason that you're saying that your ratings are gonna be good is because of your show

[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.180]
I say sir the ratings for the show the ratings for this show at nighttime the ratings in the morning

[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.220]
The ratings are gonna be good because of what?

[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.620]
If they call you follow the first so the ratings of the midday show that preceded me on this station

[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.200]
Were the worst ratings of any show on this station and they followed the first team okay?

[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.620]
Okay, so let's come up with your next copy me story

[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.500]
Let me ask you how come I had big ratings on IOD for nine years and we didn't have the first team on our show

[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.500]
Was it because I followed Mike Rineri?

[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.680]
Well, I didn't listen so I don't know also you don't know okay

[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.600]
And you also don't know about here because we don't have any ratings for this show yet

[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.740]
And also the fact that Hank follows you also

[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.740]
How does that was why so people tune in a ten and a morning and also let me say it again when I was at IOD when Hank was working there

[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.300]
He was on eight o'clock at night. So you're telling me people tune in ten in the morning because Hank was on eight o'clock at night

[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.680]
Well, the last thing I want to know why do you listen to this show sir? I want an honest answer

[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.740]
Don't give me this book crap that you don't know what you're talking about why do you listen to this show for two solid weeks?

[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.880]
Okay, I'm gonna tell you that it's because every time you open your mouth your brain fall out

[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.680]
Yeah, and it's enjoyable listening to that congratulations

[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.260]
I'm delighted that you enjoyed pal because every time you open your mouth falls out and we're enjoying it too

[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:18.500]
No, you know, I have high ratings because I follow the first team you should live so long pal and because Hank follows you and because Hank is on after me

[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.000]
That's very good logic glad your hired patio are new PD you're the new fluff Lindsay. Thank you. Lucky stars

[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.640]
You have two shows to profit you up like that's right. Thank the Lord

[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.340]
How did I ever make it at IOD and Zeta and W snooze and all those other stations without these guys to

[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.340]
To help me along to give me a walker

[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.420]
My little walker and I was on here talking about my ratings which aren't even out yet

[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.060]
So you have no clue what you're talking about my psychotic little friend go back to your play girl magazine and leave us along

[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.360]
Here's a mobile in Del Rey. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir great show. Yes, it is you know sports paid, but hey, what are you new?

[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.480]
Thank God you drive a silver vet with Panther plates. No, I don't

[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.680]
Okay, I passed one last time I thought me as you not me. Yeah, what that guy he called about man

[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.500]
That said he basically had a right man. This is just thinking out loud about what Frank was saying to that woman up in the room

[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.640]
So but I want to bang you in the butt honey and then the other one too and then the other one like oh my god

[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.520]
You're breath so beautiful. Yeah

[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.100]
But the bob and tops are right, but it'd be like you have an alaptracker George laughing in the background

[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.400]
Just gets on your nerves. I don't I don't agree

[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.460]
I mean I realized that you can do too much of that stuff

[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.620]
But I it's just part of their show there a lot of morning shows where they do that

[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.820]
If I how would show when they had all those people in there with them they do the same thing

[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.180]
There's a lot of people yuck it in up in the back. Yeah, I don't think it's the bad bob at top

[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.440]
Well, I don't worry about that

[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.380]
I worry about whether I like the material or not and whether I think it's funny now whether somebody else is laughing at it

[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.840]
There you go. I want in closing. You know how come they can take tips on the other show and you can't fit

[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.800]
Okay, we can't say what we can't say piss on this show. I didn't know that now

[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.840]
Let's see we can say it as an honor of her very adjective. I don't know how to hold we can say we say whatever the hell we want

[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.240]
All right, if mandatory can come on and talk about banging people in the butt

[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.080]
We can say whatever the hell we want. I want a banging in the butt

[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.760]
In fact, I'm gonna start wearing a jock strap and then you'll be amazed about what I'm gonna be able to say please don't pay the effort

[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.960]
Oh, Neil my queen

[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.280]

[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.500]

[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:53.520]
Have you ever heard of that before? I mean, I know Jewish women tend to be somewhat repressed and like in the dark age

[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.520]
But have you ever heard of a fag? You know what that is?

[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.920]

They sent her to die to be executed. They executed her and now life goes on

[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.000]
They're gonna give you a drug test because you're gonna work in Walgreens or something

[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.580]
They're gonna give you a drug test to be sitting behind a desk somewhere because you the executive vice president of a bank

[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.260]
That's got like 75 customers in the Pachypsy New York. They're gonna give you a drug test

[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.940]
based on what

[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:22.860]
That's like the frickin ward police we got up there at the FCC that the Congress gets together Jesse Helms and all these other Nazis

[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.280]
And they get together with these old Prudish parts and they just make up a list

[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.280]
Well, you can't say there's yeah based on what what we said so. Oh, that's great

[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.100]
That sounds like the American way to me that sounds exactly like what the founding fathers had in mind

[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.760]
founding fathers who the hell were they and what what's their score in the Olympics?

[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:45.380]
They grew hemp the founding father. Yeah, they were smoking the rope is what they were doing and they were also doing the slaves the slave women

[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.520]
But we don't want to talk about that because that's that be bad

[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.760]
Let's go secondhand we've heard of the dangers of secondhand cigarette smoke now

[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:59.040]
We got the dangers of second-hand marriage. We need smoke gonna get you disqualified and lose your metal, baby

[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.940]
And they'll stick your ass out there on peekaboo street. Here's a mobile and four-letter deal. Hello

[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.100]
Hey, Neil. Hey, don't okay, sir. I think actually it did play for Maryland

[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:13.240]
I think so but who cares? Yeah, we're about the drug testing thing. Yeah

[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.340]
Where do you go? Where do you go the line? You say it's okay that they smoke marijuana and

[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:23.380]
That's why I brought the line marijuana is not a it doesn't affect somebody's performance

[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.820]
It doesn't it doesn't enhance their performance and people are like I just said a minute ago

[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.980]
I'm gonna go around stealing money and robbing banks and

[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.720]
7-Eleven and gas stations to get money to support a marijuana habit it's ridiculous

[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.080]
That's that's your reasoning for not testing it because of why

[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.120]
What is your what is your reason that you should test for marijuana?

[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:50.300]
Well, I'm not saying that they really should I'm just saying that I don't think if they're gonna test for one they should test for all

[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.640]
I don't think they should draw a lot of things

[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.480]
How about if they test for nicotine to see if you smoke in cigarettes?

[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.040]
They're cigarettes are illegal

[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:03.200]
Well, what difference does it make whether it's legal or illegal like I said before in the state of Florida any sex other than

[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.180]
Missionary position man and woman is illegal okay?

[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:11.140]
So it should be arrest everybody for so do we go into people's bedrooms and fight out if anybody's doing it in the wrong position?

[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.180]
No, I don't I don't agree with that

[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:19.260]
It's what differences to make if we have a lot of archaic stupid laws who's business is it if it doesn't affect anything or change anything

[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:24.240]
What differences it make? Well, then it looks like the problem is actually with the law not that they're testing for marijuana

[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:30.660]
I mean, I agree I think that they should I think that they should test for marijuana there and I think that they should test for marijuana in the

[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.020]
In the NBA based on what?

[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.960]
Based on I don't because I think that the jobs get away with as much crap as they

[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.300]
They get away with too much

[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:45.320]
So so another word that's only only only only wait a minute only jock smoke marijuana is that what you're saying sir?

[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:51.340]
No, but that's what we're talking about here is where the testing is done you brought up that they're testing in the NBA

[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:57.940]
They're they test and all look at you know as well as I do that if you go into apply for a job in a lot of companies in this country

[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.760]
Not just sports in any kind of endeavor government job

[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.440]
You're gonna they have random drug testing you know that I hope

[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.740]
Yes, I do and based on what what is it there business if you're smoking pot?

[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.600]
I don't know maybe they're afraid of

[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:16.020]
Your job performance maybe I'm not really sure. I can't really I can't really tell you why they do it

[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:20.600]
I'm just saying that if they're gonna test for what how is that gonna affect your job performance

[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.140]
Well, you mean if you smoke marijuana the night before yeah exactly

[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.600]
Listen, I'm not giving you an answer for why they do it. I said that but we're having a discussion

[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.760]
I'm not asking you to justify it, but what how is the smoking weed gonna affect your job performance

[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.660]
Nothing it will I don't say no. So what's so what's the point?

[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.060]
Well, like I said, I think it's because if they're gonna test for one we're gonna test for all

[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.440]
I don't think that if you say okay, well, hey, it's okay if you go ahead and smoke marijuana

[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.020]
We're gonna test you out for cocaine

[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.200]
You don't see a difference between hard drugs and marijuana. You don't see it

[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.060]
Okay, get a new phone sir and call me back. I'd be delighted to what debated with you but your phone blows

[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.800]
This guy doesn't see a difference between cocaine

[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:06.040]
Which is a highly addictive substance which affects people's personality and behavior and in many cases causes them to become

[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.880]
Dangerous that is correct

[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.000]
Trust me when I tell you I have known people who become totally changed

[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.900]
Personality change our untrustworthy those people most of you don't want working for you

[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.380]
If they're really addicted to cow cocaine if they have a serious

[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.620]
Crack problem or any other kind of a coke problem or heroin

[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.680]
Chris probably the night they had some brought on their one of the

[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:33.040]
In one of the tabloids shows last night the night before he croaked

[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.480]
How much how much heroin I pray heroin and coke and

[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:43.120]
Fish food and whatever else he was doing all together and vodka on top of it just to make you should wash it down

[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:48.020]
You got to wash it down with some good vodka. That's right. That's what Boris said bad enough

[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.020]
It wasn't bad enough that he was doing a hero but he was doing coke too. So he's dead Chris Farley there you go

[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:57.540]
But I mean this this guy comparing I mean y'all yeah, they're getting away with enough is it?

[00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.300]
Who cares about that

[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.820]
Why don't we get all upset if they're beating up their wife or their girlfriend?

[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.360]
Why don't we get upset about that? How come nobody gave a crap at the Jimmy Johnson sign up Lawrence Phillips?

[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.840]
Who's nothing but a goddamn gangster? How come that nobody cared about that?

[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:16.140]
But we're concerned if he passes a drug test or not that really concerns me whether he's smoking marijuana

[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.880]
Not what he's gonna be beaten women up all over the place

[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.500]
What kind of mentality we be talking about in this country man

[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.640]
We're talking about people to just they can't sit down and look at this thing rationally because most of them are emotional cripples

[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.420]
emotional cripples

[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.240]
And this crap about the NBA is gonna do

[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:38.100]
Pot testing David Robinson says oh yeah, we should all subject to it. It's a no-brainer the NBA as an old

[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.900]
Okay, it's brought a bunch of illiterate

[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.340]
This is what it is David Robinson you ask whole here's Miami. Hello

[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.100]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay, he's on pit dog

[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.720]
Going ahead sir. I'm listening. Okay. Well anyway on the second hand smoke with the marijuana

[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.200]
I have a friend who basically

[00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:01.920]
Did not smoke because of the government watching over him yeah, and he enjoys

[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.600]
Burning every couple of times. So when he went to get a mandatory

[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.440]
You know, just as if he came back positive people

[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:16.760]
Yeah, it's there's an officer like oh no, I was in a room with a bunch of people smoking yeah

[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:24.380]
The probation officer gave him a bunch of like I got a green bit for both of Brian by the way to the tuna second hand row is second hand smoke

[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.480]
But anyway

[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:33.080]
Anyway, he says that the probation officer here in a bunch of evidence about how much second hand smoke you had to be in

[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.540]
Exposed to for you to come back positive for even a minister amount you had to be in a room that was

[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:46.500]
Buzzbub for a couple of hours, you know constantly breathing it yeah, and I mean if you smoke pot in the bath at any point

[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.220]
If you like to smoke that stuff and you're in a room and they've been smoking it for two hours

[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.040]
You're gonna tell me you're not gonna take a hit or whatever and I mean snowboard

[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.760]
So let's still let me ask you some of the good did well no wait

[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.900]
Oh, I want to hear this about snowboarding. Let's hear this this. Oh, I mean snowboarding in the Olympics

[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.720]
Who is not gonna think that these snowboarders are not hot addicts? I mean I think all these guys are a bunch

[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.820]
addict oh, yeah, I mean oh, they are

[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:16.680]
God, how about brain testing for management that sounds good to me of course where there's no sense. There's no feeling

[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.500]
Here's North Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, you're doing Neil great

[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:27.140]
I have a question. Yes, I have two questions, and then I want to see them in the box

[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.100]
How come you can't get ice cream like Italy?

[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.740]
Can Italy the stash of ice cream in it?

[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:37.320]
Elato sir. Elato is not ice cream. It's gelato. It's major doesn't have all that cream and it's

[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.640]
not all that's a chalk and artificial crap. It's made from all natural stuff and they don't make it here

[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.000]
They're you know once in a while a place will come along and try to make good gelato

[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.600]
And even if it is good the public's tasty or so bad because they're busy eating briers and siltas and eat ease that those places a lot of business

[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:59.140]
And I see I mean I don't I'm not an ice cream but I was eating it every day twice and I scream too

[00:19:59.140 --> 00:19:59.420]
Hey

[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.180]
I have a question for George

[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.260]
You guys just have this commercial called the field extreme watches was his voice on it?

[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:07.980]
Yeah

[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.300]
Yeah, he apologized so fiercely for it

[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.880]
And about let me ask you a question if this guy would have been from M today more illegal to smoke hot

[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.380]
Well, what were they going to say to the guy? Well, you know, it's interesting because of murder that now

[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:28.220]
That is a good point. Merlewanda. They were just saying on CNN that Merlewanda is not among the substances listed at the Olympics as being illegal

[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.640]
But that it reverts back to the country and the laws there

[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.420]
So if it were one of the Dutch players in like a soccer player

[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.420]
Of course, then I'll play no soccer in the winter Olympics. But whatever the Dutch competitors are ice

[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:44.800]
I don't think that's very fair. How do you like that? How do you like them green apples? Huh?

[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.820]
Those green apples I don't know. I say that this guy this

[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.640]
Graziano or Greg Gabriotti. What I say you should move to how Amsterdam would be a good idea

[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.620]
Hey there you go. At least you'd have a good time and as far as drug testing in the workplace

[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.560]
Yes, so they can figure out

[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.900]
It's a they can drug test you at the moment and know how much you've had at that

[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:10.300]
For typical moment. I think they should just band it all together because there's no way that you're going to tell me what I have to do in my house

[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:14.980]
In my car or what I do at any time that I'm not at work because I only work for them for eight hours

[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:20.220]
Not the rest of my day. So that's the bottom line. They're next thing. They're going to be doing fish food testing

[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:26.700]
Hey there you go. Yeah, why don't we just survey and see how I like to eat your fat. I want you to see how much food you've been eating right?

[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:35.580]
Exactly

[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:41.160]
Now you're talking okay have a rate they found okay sounds like a job he wants I did that one time

[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.340]
Learned about 15 years old for outstanding selection of Italian

[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.560]
Let's do a mobile in West Palm Beach hello

[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:04.220]
Yeah, I'm telling you I was more dicting than codes and anything I mean we have to smoke more dicking than fish food too

[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:09.740]
Correct. You're getting in his pants another room better take a sample by the way before we know I'm 38

[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.280]
I stopped there from you to go but before we say they fall with smoke to throw into movies to smoke

[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:19.820]
Yeah, we had sex with smoke before anything you need a pot. You can do it without pot. Yeah

[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:25.020]
A lot of my friends are still I'm well let me ask you this as much as I found upon people who I liked

[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.820]
Obsessed with pot because there are people who are juvenile and sit around sifting and picking seeds all day

[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.560]
And I think that's a life but nevertheless

[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:42.840]
You got this green stuff that had most season. I mean how did it affect your life it affected it tremendously because it opened the door to and you're gonna think

[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.500]
This is a joke it opened the doors to

[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:50.180]
Coast it opened the book game. Yeah, yeah, go once you violate your body

[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.640]
So I guess you better never have a beer because next thing you're gonna be

[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.560]
I never liked here, but I'm telling you to affect me in the workplace that affected me driving

[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:03.240]
Had a lot of that. No, but they argument that you know, it's the same argument as you better never have a beer because then you're gonna

[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:08.260]
Becoming alcoholic and you're gonna start drinking you know sticking vodka bottles in your pocket

[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.460]
I mean there are there are always gonna people it be people no matter what you're talking about

[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:16.160]
They're the outgold stains of the world are gonna go out and eat until they get to be 500 pounds

[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.320]
Does that mean we should outlaw any foods? They're fanding no, no, but I you know

[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.420]
I changed I have two kids of my own now and

[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.840]
They're 14 and 11 and they're getting to that age where

[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.240]
Um, where I remember when I was so you better stop. Yeah. Yeah. No, no

[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.380]
I stopped a long time ago, but about I'm saying now I'm overprotective

[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.640]
I look as they're bringing airs home. I mean my parents are like George's

[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.260]
There were refugees from Cuba. They came down here. Yeah. Well, we know humans don't smoke. We know that

[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:48.740]
They didn't know any better. They were working 14 hours a day. I was alone at home and all my friends did and we did it

[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.420]
And I'm calling the doctor. I don't know. But I couldn't disagree with you warm

[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.480]
I'm just looking for it and I hope

[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.960]
They keep it out of everything because it's like my life

[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:02.460]
You know something I know that when I go over to Holland man every time I've only been in Amsterdam about 30 times

[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.340]
I'm gonna go over there. It's a miracle that the country can function. You know it

[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.440]
Well, let me tell you something

[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.580]
Well, we're on it or less aggressive

[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.420]
Let me ask you have you ever ever been to Amsterdam?

[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.580]
Never been so well get on a plane to go there. You might learn something

[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.300]
There's a pot addict for you there boys and girls. There's a good lesson for everybody

[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.200]
He's obsessed like the fish food addicts

[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.580]
I say we go to public right now

[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.520]
I may enforce them to take a red-out of a freezer container because we have fish food addicts already

[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:33.120]
And those people are gonna kill themselves on that crap because they're out of control and let's pose down every bar

[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.900]
Because we got alcoholics

[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.820]
Let's bring back prohibition baby. Let's prohibit everything. Then we got sex addicts. Just watch

[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.420]
What's his name jury Springer? He'll do about 20 shows on at this week sex addicts people who can't get enough

[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:50.240]
They're doing it the NBA they want to do drug testing. We got a guy a Canadian jock

[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.120]
If a snowboarder can wear a jock strap whatever the hell he was

[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.520]
This guy may lose his gold medal because he may have actually inhaled a little bit

[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.420]
Or may have actually smoked a little bit or may have actually walked through a room somewhere where somebody may have

[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.300]
Smoked it or not as the case may be and they found like a little trace in his

[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:10.020]
Squirt's quirt. Yeah, and they're having a nervous breakdown now because they you know suit a fit

[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.980]
What else what else can we test for in your system?

[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.380]
Definitely have fish food testing because we know it makes your blood sugar go way up and you become irresponsible

[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.980]
And got only knows you're gonna you're not fit for driving

[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.980]
I wouldn't be surprised if they stop you at street corners now

[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.880]
It's stoplights and they do on the spot checks blood sugar tests

[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.260]
You know they give you that little pin prick if I can say that and

[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.160]
Yeah, look at my fingertips man. Look at all those pin pricks. That's right when you die pedic

[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.580]
They have a lot of pin pricks on the tips of your fingers

[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.900]
But at any rate

[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.280]
Yeah, they're gonna be starting to do that spot checks on street corners now

[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.940]
And if your blood sugar is like over 250 but I are straight to jail

[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.920]
You're on menace this society. You're gonna kill somebody out there

[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.780]
airline pilot before you get on that plane make sure he didn't have no fish food before he took off

[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.600]
Here's the

[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.040]
When it's got some pot here's for a lot of Dale. Hello. I've never listened to your show before but I

[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:05.040]
I was interested in your views on why why it's illegal in the first place

[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.260]
I mean, they mean this is all I can prepare

[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:12.240]
Sure because this is a repressive society in which we live let me say it again

[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:19.840]
These are kxotomy laws that are in the book and most states in this country in which or anything except a face-to-face missionary position

[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.180]
Sex between married male and female what you're laughing about it. I'm okay

[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.280]
But it's true

[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.540]
These are k-k laws on the books because this is a country of

[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:33.260]
A country that's living in the stone age because we got a bunch of old funny studies up there

[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.640]
Who don't have the balls to be clear these are kx

[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.160]
Who said laws that have no place in a civilized society?

[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:39.340]
Well

[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.240]
Marijuana case to have whatever

[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:47.180]
There'll be no national bet if they would have acted and and burned it the last 20 years

[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:53.440]
But let me say this to you sir the idea that the federal government listen to this the federal government can tell you what

[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.860]
Seen you can plant in the backyard of your home on your property the idea that the government can

[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.940]
Legislate that is so outrageous and so unacceptable as to be

[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.420]
In just inexplicable

[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:12.440]
And argue with that one that they're always helicopter wasting time because people are growing a few plants in their backyard

[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:18.980]
In the meantime up the corner kids are shooting themselves because daddy left his six his six shooter laying around and everybody in their brother

[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:23.000]
And his country's running around with a goddamn gun, but God forbid that somebody's growing a few

[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]
Plants in a backyard. We got the helicopters going overhead baby

[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:34.880]
We're gonna catch you the the pot police are there you maniacs just like in a low where the hell I do with that local section this morning

[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.820]
Here we go business man or sex pervader police this Arthur van morque

[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.840]
Kirk and whatever his name is Kirk and jerkin

[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.800]
Grana six million dollar prostitution ring how do you like that in port Lauderdale

[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:52.040]
Yet 50 women on their payroll their names neatly lined up on a magnetic board under heading such as blondes

[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:57.680]
Grunettes and orientals the clients more than 20,000 men between West Palm Beach and North Miami

[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:03.800]
You'll pay a hundred eighty bucks and cash or 200 by credit card for acts that range from a straight sex to unusual fetishes

[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:11.080]
So who the hell gives a crap probably ran a clean operation probably not too many people getting no diseases from that operation

[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.380]
Probably headed on the up and up. He's going to jail

[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.140]
Everything in his goddamn country's illegal man

[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:20.640]
Everything is the forbidden fruit if we can say on of course that's oh forget that

[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.920]
Talk about a fruit

[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.800]
We'll get about that everything's illegal

[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.880]
Everything's immoral unless of course it's the politicians who are doing it like Dan Rolemer

[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:35.520]
He's doing it over there and like Bill Clinton of course he's doing it the left and right in which we like him a lot more

[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.720]
And respected because he's getting that that's okay

[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.380]
But if we're getting it then of course it's evil and we all go to go to jail

[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:42.900]
Chuvan island

[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:49.960]
Unacceptable unacceptable your brainwashed baby when you're gonna go just wake up and sniff it a little bit

[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:57.680]
And the flowers too brainwashing goody two shoes. We have to have a drinking age and we have to have a we have to have an age for everything a

[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.840]
Smoking age in other words when you're 21 it's okay to get yourself lung cancer

[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.840]
But if you're 19 and as they're you're not old enough to make that decision

[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.940]
Just like this crap about the age of majority every you know most countries

[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:13.300]
What is this is just a matter of opinion most countries even something that we consider very backward

[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.240]
The illegal age for

[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:22.980]
Concentral sexual acts is 15 or 16 in this country. It's what 17 for heterosexual acts and 18 for yes

[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:28.760]
There's a different age for heterosexual or homosexual acts of course or is it 18 for both?

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.840]
There's all these gray areas depending on which state you're in I didn't say gay areas

[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:38.020]
I said what what's well? We'll find out what state you're in lies in the prone or what does it mean?

[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:43.420]
If you're more than two years older you can be 16 as long as the person isn't more than two years older and over eight well

[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.220]
And that is right

[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:50.080]
You know guys bang the 16 year old chick. He's in violation of the laws that we're saying to me something like that

[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.700]
Isn't that ridiculous? Yeah, isn't that absurd?

[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:00.580]
Here's a port Lauderdale. Hello, yes, sir back to you happy circus

[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.920]
Yeah, on that brought to you ring the guys from

[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:08.920]
Bolton out of port Lauderdale no big deal. Well, there you go. You're right. Plaken up for us. Yeah, you got it

[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.140]
Another thing on the thundered pot. I own a business. I drugged that

[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.560]
Right on the application you bring the drugs man. I test

[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:18.820]
Right

[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:26.400]
Where we certainly know nothing about drugs. There's your kind of boss George. I thought we had that. Oh, yeah

[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.820]
He wouldn't know what to do with him as in

[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:32.380]
The

[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.900]
Uh

[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.040]
I feel like crap.

[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.140]
It's time to 45, but it's doing 22.

[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.260]
I feel like crap.

[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.480]
I feel like crap.

[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:57.600]

[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:57.600]

[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:57.600]

[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:57.640]

[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:57.640]

[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:57.640]

[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.000]
It's time to 45, but it's doing 22.

[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:10.120]
I feel like crap.

[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.900]
It's time to 45, but it's doing 22.

[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.240]
It's been a good week.

[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.980]
The waitress knows.

[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.240]
There's no tip tonight.

[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.640]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.580]
I hope she's good.

[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.640]
So doesn't speak French and the frog gets pissed.

[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.100]
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.180]
Why is she pissed?

[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.740]
But when the check comes, she can read English.

[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.500]
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.000]
She walks the bar.

[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.040]
Yeah, we know for life, do we?

[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.780]
But do they have to be so cheap?

[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.460]
Why must you frog?

[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.540]
They're all the way to Florida.

[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.680]
Go for it!

[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.800]
Go for it!

[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:57.940]
Why can't you just stop at thousands of the borders?

[00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.520]
Go for it!

[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.260]
We don't want you!

[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.240]
Frogs on the feet, you're such a scary side.

[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.720]
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.640]
Look at that!

[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.860]
The belly's feeling over and the fannics full tight.

[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.160]
They're wild, are they?

[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.140]
They're wild.

[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:18.900]
They're wild.

[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.600]
I wish they'd just go back.

[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.200]
I can't take it anymore.

[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.400]
What is summer coming?

[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.900]
I'll help them back.

[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.600]
We're going to a driving cross-hunk.

[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.640]
You know we always have many goliens in the driving center.

[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.420]
We had a few goliens driving across the interstates.

[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.460]
And the staff at one of those stuckeys or stuckeys or whatever they're called.

[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.920]
Man, talk about packed with goliens with bad taste.

[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.520]
Although I do like some of that candy, the peanut brittle is okay.

[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:46.560]
Never have a nut roll.

[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.100]
Yeah, when it slipped out of my hand.

[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:49.520]
Didn't roll too far though.

[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.760]
Here's their coconut grove.

[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.740]
There's no frags in Columbus.

[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.020]
Yeah, that's what I hear.

[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.120]
Neil, do you remember a couple years ago?

[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:56.960]
Maybe one or two.

[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.700]
A guy was driving down a 75.

[00:32:59.300 --> 00:32:59.960]
He was depressed.

[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.200]
One of the commits suicide.

[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.500]
And he jumped into his club with a six pack.

[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.860]
Driving down a 75 the wrong way.

[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:06.900]
Right, I remember that.

[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:07.560]
Yeah, sure do.

[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.000]
Stuff like that that makes me think.

[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.400]
I don't understand why alcohol legal in my one is not.

[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:11.760]
Right.

[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.780]
I was saying my smoker.

[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:13.440]
Good point.

[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.100]
Real quick.

[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.480]
How much we need to add a smoke for the same effect?

[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.340]
Think about it.

[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.440]
How long it would have taken.

[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.160]
Real quick, Neil.

[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.580]
I heard a song about tongues, religious tongues,

[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.040]
speaking in tongues, and that kind of gave me a flashback.

[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:25.540]
Yeah.

[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.500]
My mom used to be a panacostal.

[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.620]
And I grew up, and I remember seeing my grandmother, my mom,

[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.220]
and just like talking in tongues and dropping on the floor.

[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.760]
And I would just sit there and giggle.

[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:37.780]
You know, it made no sense to me whatsoever.

[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.820]
Anyway, real quick, Neil.

[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.700]
It's enough to give me the hibi jibies just for you.

[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.920]
I was saying, you know, a song once.

[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.940]
It was for the panthers, and all that too.

[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.200]
And I got to know the one.

[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.220]
Please let me sing it.

[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:48.780]
Okay, go ahead.

[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:49.120]
Okay.

[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.080]
I'm Chris Weber.

[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.900]
I'm Chris Weber.

[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.000]
I'm Chris Weber.

[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.600]
God, arrested for a bag of bread here.

[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.960]
I'm the ghetto dream.

[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.660]
The play be ball without a drug screen.

[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.660]
I'm Chris Weber.

[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.500]
I'm Chris Weber.

[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.020]
Call time out when I got sprayed with pepper.

[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:15.720]
My eyes that mean about a couple drops of vise.

[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.880]
I'm James Brown.

[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.480]
I'm James Brown.

[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.220]
Neil.

[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:20.840]
Yeah.

[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:21.980]
In clothing.

[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:23.200]

[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.740]
Please, could you play all the sticks of brown?

[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.980]
All the sticks are brown.

[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.620]
Where are you guys coming up with this stuff?

[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.920]
I haven't heard that in a long time.

[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.600]
What if five, 60 on the mobile one line?

[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:33.500]
Here's Miami Springs.

[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:33.900]
Hello.

[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.360]
Yeah, hi.

[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.300]
That was that.

[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:40.300]
I heard the guy talking about the fact that it was legal.

[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.460]
And it was legal.

[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.100]
But, you know, I don't smoke marijuana.

[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.000]
I haven't done since college days.

[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.340]
But, but this poison?

[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:48.940]
Yes, yes, you can.

[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.200]
Yes, you can.

[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.600]
And that will kill you.

[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:54.180]
It's got warning labels on the can or whatever you're buying it.

[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.720]
And you can go into any story.

[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.680]
You can go into a supermarket.

[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.660]
You go into drugstore.

[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.600]
And, illegally, all kinds of substances that will kill you.

[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.040]
You can go into Home Depot and buy paint thinner.

[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.060]
And if you drink it, it will kill you.

[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.020]
I guarantee you that make no mistake about it.

[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:12.300]
So, the idea that something may or may not be harmful for you,

[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.000]
which is all very subjective, by the way.

[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.220]
And a lot of it very dubious and debatable.

[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:20.680]
But, since when is that the only job that I see the government is to tell us,

[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.320]
you know, give us the information.

[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.440]
Tell us, can this be harmful to me?

[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.680]
How harmful is it?

[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.440]
And what may might well guide them in a second?

[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.620]
Well, that's what I'm saying.

[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.580]
You know, the thing is that the only reason it was made illegal,

[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.880]
is because it's relatively easy to grow and difficult to tax.

[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:42.600]
And by the lobbying of both alcohol and cigarettes,

[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.840]
which, well, alcohol is relatively easy.

[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.360]
But the question of cigarettes growing, it drying it out,

[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.120]
and actually making cigarettes on your own, most people aren't going to do.

[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.820]
Whereas, anybody could grow plants in the backyard,

[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.900]
and they just simply take a few leaves,

[00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:00.300]
let them dry out in the oven, and then smoke it.

[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.040]
Oh, my God.

[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:05.440]
And, apparently, that's what they don't want.

[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:09.000]
And there would be a lot of competition for those two other industries.

[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.580]
Oh, my God.

[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:15.200]
Whereas, in tobacco, that's proving beyond a shadow of doubt.

[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.160]
That's killing people every day, sure.

[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.380]
There are people puffing on faggots right now,

[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.240]
who are going to croak from lung cancer and emphysema.

[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.000]
And we've warned them, and we've warned them,

[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.760]
and we've had all those craggy voice guys.

[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.380]
The guy that used to play Hamilton Berger on Perry Mason,

[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.140]
what the hell was his deal?

[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.080]
And then they're going to be talking about,

[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.560]
I'm dying from lung cancer and John Wayne,

[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.800]
and all these other big macho guys that are croaking.

[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.380]
And if you, you know, they tell you that,

[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.980]
and you still want to smoke, then go ahead, be my guest.

[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:39.760]
And in quotes?

[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.800]
Just don't blow it in my face. That's what the monocle said.

[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.600]
They're puffing on cigarettes, too.

[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.600]
Exactly. Have a great day.

[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.020]
All right.

[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:48.920]
Okay. What are we getting all worked up about?

[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.020]
I just because we realize we live in a country where our

[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:51.980]
freedoms are very limited.

[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.700]
We have a bunch of, we have a bunch of assholes sitting around

[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.440]
deciding what you can do and what you can't do,

[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.040]
and telling you what's good for you and what's not.

[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.820]
And then we have some idiots who go along with that,

[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.100]
who want to be manipulated.

[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.940]
But if you want to be manipulated, okay,

[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:05.780]
go to some fascist goddamn place.

[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.840]
Go to some communist country. Go to Cuba for Christ's sake.

[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:09.700]
Go live with Adele.

[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.620]
They'll tell you what you can do and what you can't do.

[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:12.920]
Go live with the Pope.

[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.980]
You'll have one hell of a time there, man.

[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:15.860]
Go live in a Vatican.

[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:18.260]
Under the watchful eye of the Cardinals, man,

[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.520]
I don't mean Stan Musiel.

[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.600]
You won't be able to do anything that's fun,

[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.600]
because they're busy doing taking them all up themselves.

[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:24.340]
Hi.

[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.640]
Thank you for calling Dick Vitow's hot sex line.

[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.880]
Cost is $5 per minute.

[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.900]
For Dick's most intimate fantasies, press one.

[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.460]
Oh, baby, it's me. Big Dick Vitow.

[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.360]
And you know what I like? Oh, yeah, I think you know.

[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.960]
I like balls. Balls bouncing all around me. Oh, baby,

[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.620]
that's like our final ball play.

[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.460]
And then I like the big man.

[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.500]
Yeah, to take it to the hole again, again and again.

[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.120]
Hey, don't hang on the rim, big guy.

[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.660]
And don't people between your legs, baby.

[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.300]
I'm not through with you.

[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.360]
Come on, let's see if you can calm these balls.

[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.300]
Oh, yeah, that's unbelievable.

[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.620]
You're all world, baby.

[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.240]
Drive my lane.

[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.440]
Baby, drive my lane.

[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.620]
Come on, come on.

[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.420]
Post up behind me.

[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:18.540]
Oh, yeah.

[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.320]
The clock's running out.

[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.240]
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.720]
Oh, unbelievable. It's good.

[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.320]
Oh, that was good.

[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.260]
Yes, yes, yes.
