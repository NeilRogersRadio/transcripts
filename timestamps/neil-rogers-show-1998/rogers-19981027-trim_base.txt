[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]
on page of the papers this morning trademark litigate loses and wins

[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.660]
That's right. Broward jury in a very peculiar thing they gave car max 50 million dollars and said well

[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.240]
Even if you didn't really actually steal their name nevertheless, so you still have to pay 50 million dollars

[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.100]
So Republic who stock is down there in the crapper in the toilet

[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.320]
I'm gonna have to cough up 50 million but they're gonna go to a pill it and who knows what's gonna happen

[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.020]
But nevertheless, we like it. It's a good old man

[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.420]
So

[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.800]
Anyway, Susan this morning calls in on the worst team one of the very few calls and the Susan says now

[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.920]
What are these rumors? I'm hearing about you guys going to keep I want you to follow the logic of this

[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.820]
Okay, the rumors I'm hearing about you guys going off the air on this morning show because I've been listening a long time

[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.300]
And I love you guys and a lot of women listen about a beep that about and of course

[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.800]
I never listen to the rest of the stuff certainly those who listen to hands and I wouldn't listen that that what's his name

[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.460]
What's his name? How do you like that? That's fucking bitch. Yeah, what's his name?

[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.160]
So again like I've told you many times before with some of these sports nerds

[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.840]
I don't even have a name. I'm like red China. I'm like red effing China, baby. I don't have a name

[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.420]
We're gonna have a miracle record a new song a host with new name

[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.820]
With not with a no no no name. What's wrong with that?

[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.080]
In fact, there's what there's one for Bokobran a host with no name so the tune of a horse with no name great song by the one

[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.200]
Whatever happened to America. Oh, yeah, a lot of people were asking that question

[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.660]
In fact, if you try to watch that TV show on whammy, you're probably asking whatever happened to America

[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.140]
Whatever happened of the days we could turn on our TV set and expect to be able to see and hear whatever the program was on the year

[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.600]
I could easily do the rest of the four hours which would be another waste of my time because nobody's watching anyway

[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.580]
And if you wonder why nobody's watching one of the reasons is

[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.240]
Probably these days the main reason is because they can't hear it

[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.900]
I

[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.420]
Flip over their 10 30 last night after watching the Leafs play a coma game get pounded by Pittsburgh to nothing

[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.660]
Which again could have been 10 nothing if we're in Perkugio, but nevertheless I

[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.500]
Flip over there to well. I watched the show nights you what they do if I got the chicken on my head

[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.300]
If I got the propeller beanie on my head, which I had both and it was a pretty entertaining show if you could hear the sound

[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.060]
And again, it's a

[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.640]
And then of course when you turn the volume up the hum

[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.280]
Like I've told you before even Monica never perfected the old hum job like they have it when he meant the hum gets louder and louder and louder

[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.580]
To the point where I was in the first 30 seconds. They know that anybody nearby mine's gonna shut it off

[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.200]
An interesting part of this whole deal is that they're still when the spots in the promos come on after the segments of the show the audio is perfect

[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200]
No problem whatsoever

[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.560]
The problem being that the handful of sponsors that they have on here who are still crazy enough to be buying spots on that show

[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.900]
They're being sucked into vibes of I'm advertising out of show that nobody could watch if they wanted to what because you can't hear the sound

[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.320]
So you know, what what can I say? I mean, I've said it a million times before I can't say here and accuse anybody of

[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.100]
Deliberately sabotaging but it's got to be one of two things either the most in because the finished product that they sent over there from here is

[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.260]
Perfect the video is perfect the audio is perfect. There are no problems on a product leaving this building going over Lincoln Road

[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.520]
But somewhere in the transition

[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.660]
With all that multi-million dollar digital equipment. They got the state of the art over there. They can't get the sound on a year

[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.620]
Only between 10 30 and 11 o'clock at night for Neil at night. They can't get the sound on a year

[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.340]
Is there a problem with the sound on sports down? No with the

[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.700]
MASH no with the kipasa USA no with

[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.720]
Generation any any problem there with a sound no

[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.260]
But when we got Neil at night on air for some bizarre peak killer reason we can't hear the god damn show

[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.540]
So like I said, it's either gotta be the epitome of ineptitude

[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.480]
Or it's gotta be that somebody over there don't like me

[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.240]
Do you don't think that's possible do you? Uh-huh because it's interesting that this is technical

[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.000]
We have back in the beginning of the technical which is on all the shows

[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.620]
It's like but I never disappoint

[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.080]
Every night you get that big hum job with you wanted or not which you hey, that's the american way, you know

[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.260]
Strong with that

[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.500]
So I just thought I mentioned that in passing again just like uh leejay kops said in the exorcist

[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.960]
I mentioned it only in passing

[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.160]
Father paranoia answered a question

[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.980]
And as far as paranoia is concerned I'm gonna tell you I could do with the next 75 hours on the Murray's

[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.780]
Terry Murray and brine where like I said it's the same person there's only one Murray

[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.140]
And this guy's as white Clark Kent you take the glasses off it's Superman you put the glasses on it's Clark Kent

[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.300]
You say suckling suck attach it's Terry Murray you say shuffling suck attach it's Brian Murray

[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.840]
That's the only difference. It's the same bozo

[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.060]
Nine minutes after ten it flies to them sound

[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.380]
Enter her yeah I hear

[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.860]
You know shop EQA air

[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.000]
Ray with the has repair it was that

[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.220]
He's the polian coffin do we know no damn it

[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.800]
1015 at 516 wqm how you doing Susan you know Susan's out there right now

[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.260]
Yeah, I would listen to that what's his name what is it with the women in this town

[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.540]
Stuffy nasty I'm not saying all of them only about 80%

[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.040]
Misurable humorless obnoxious disgusting

[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.380]
It's a radio show okay, it's just a goddamn radio show

[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.240]
I wasn't gonna say anything there was a guy to hockey in the other night at the Friday night game

[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.840]
When I was like the big star and I should have been because nothing else was going on other than a messie

[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.560]
Nice called air Chris Moore and how come so non-committal on a morning show this morning

[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.900]
You know that's another thing they also don't admit that they listen to show and I've been told on very good authority

[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.620]
Defoe listens to this radio station not just this show 24 hours a day

[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.160]
Non-stop in his sleep. He's got the headsets on

[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.460]
He's listening to Eddie K overnight to get the morning line odds on it got them vassier ball game

[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.420]
Error every minute of the day he's listening

[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.380]
But somehow they didn't hear the fact we played Christina Moore and that putrid embarrassing worst call in a history of sports casting

[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.100]
On mark messie a six-hundredth goal

[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.920]
So they play the card this morning and then very non-committal I noticed by the way not just guilty

[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.600]
But even the other two guys all of a sudden lost both their pair

[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.420]
It was the ball this show on there this morning because nobody anything well, uh, but it means but it will be out

[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.080]
They're afraid I guess Christina Moore is gonna show up on that show again like you did last this season

[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.860]
And all of a sudden he deballed everybody all three of course gellie

[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.860]
You didn't have to debull him because somebody beat them to the job, but nevertheless

[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.820]
So at any rate speaking of the panthers

[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.100]
This is you know, it's it's very sad if you can sell them in my life including last year's putrid season

[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.300]
If I seen anything so uninspiring so disorganized so embarrassing

[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.420]
And when Terry Murray and you are witness when he came in here that one day. I met him for the first time

[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:57.700]
I said on the year good guy like him. I went over to the macarena that third time to see the get my guided tour the place

[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.460]
Of the joint if I can say that and took me down to the offices. There was Billy Smith plus offices

[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.420]
sat down had a little chat with Terry good guy

[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.200]
Good guy sitting in I bought Brian Marie dinner that night at the El Milino in plantation

[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.960]
Good guy and I still say good guys

[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.060]
But do they know anything? No are they doing anything that makes any sense? No

[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.740]
Here we go with the same bull crap out and I'm gonna predict it right now

[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.020]
Because I watched that Pittsburgh Leafs game last night Pittsburgh totally dominated leaves you know

[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.300]
Would do to play a bad game and they did

[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.940]
But Marty struck a played one hell of a game for the penguins last night killing penalties

[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:41.780]
He's out there blocking shots. He was dynamite Saturday scores two goals in that game had another goal that they thought he had

[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.820]
But then credited to somebody else could add a hat trick in the game Saturday hell of a player

[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.480]
Doug McLean didn't like Marty struck up

[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.880]
So Doug McLean wouldn't play Marty struck a and then every time he did play him if he didn't score at least

[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.240]
10 goals in that game he'd cinemaed again

[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:04.400]
He made it impossible for him to play on this team and just about then ended his career until Pittsburgh give him another chance

[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.020]
I foresee that Terry Marie's got the same deal here with Ray Whitney who beyond any question

[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:17.480]
Last see question. There's no debate every statistical category goals assist power play goals

[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.360]
You name it virtually every category. He scored the goal

[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.660]
To give the Panthers the win

[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.380]
I'm looking at the statistics here

[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.180]
Victor Coslov's got no points minus three is he sitting out no

[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:39.060]
Gully Lindsay a nice hair no goals no assists minus three and a plus and minus no points sitting him out no no

[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.520]
I'm gonna predict you today right here on a year that

[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.960]
Terry Marie will do the same thing to Ray Whitney unfortunately

[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.200]
That Doug McLean did to Marty struck up

[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.900]
When I pick up my paper this morning and read bench Panthers to make return against Redwings and Roberts fail

[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.660]
Be back in line up and Ray Whitney will be back but on the fourth line

[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.740]
on the fourth line

[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:07.860]
On the Gune line the checker line with Dwayne Hay and Peter Royal

[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:16.100]
I'm saying to myself this man has got to be crazy there must be some kind of a thing in that family

[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.700]
You take your your here's a team that can't score

[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.320]
I went and saw two games two long Ponderous games in three nights

[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.300]
When's the night they scored one goal

[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.340]
Friday getting to the season was foreign away the worst team in the league till they finally fired the espasitas and getting their act together

[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.500]
Other than scoring four goals in that game if they scored more than two goals in any other game. No

[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:35.740]
No

[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.020]
So they need scoring after they need people who can stick the puck in the net. That's what the game is all about allegedly

[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.020]
Especially when you have mediocre goal tending which we've got

[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.160]
In spite of the fact we were talking last season. Oh, we got to upgrade the goal tending

[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.240]
That's one of our big things we got and did we do it? No of course not

[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.860]
More B-Ech

[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:01.260]
But when I see that they're taking the best player from last year and because maybe he didn't play great on Friday night

[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.360]
But who the hell did now. Let's make an example out of him

[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.080]
It's the spike game all over again. That's what we're gonna do for some reason. I don't know what to deal is

[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:16.200]
Robbie need a Meyer who must have naked pictures of the Murray brothers doing each other with a goat in the middle

[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:23.700]
It's gotta be yet. I'm sir. He robbed the Empire must have pictures of Brian and Terry Murray doing it with a goat doing a three way

[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.420]
Gotta be

[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.340]
Let's take a look at his statistics

[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.340]
Six games no goals

[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.500]
One assist minus one plus and minus and

[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.880]
The assist again like I said cars lost standing all alone in front of it. My grandmother could made that pass

[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.240]
To set up that goal even though the announcer is trying to make a big a

[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.200]
Yeah, he sucks

[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.140]
He can't get the job done. He's a disgrace. He's the highest paid player on the team

[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:59.200]
No, is he skating well? No, is he doing that like lost? He's like a lost puppy out there and has been this is a 30 year in a row

[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:05.360]
Did they try to get rid of him? No, they desperate was Brian Marie psychotic over the fact that my smith and Toronto didn't make the deal

[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:11.620]
And that we didn't get Felix Paifan was Brian Marie psychotic about that you vet because I was there that he was talking about it

[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.680]
He was pitched off baby

[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.900]
And we don't hear any in fact we hear the coach Terry Murray quoted in the paper a couple of days ago

[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.020]
Ascent if it takes Robbie 20 games to get his act together

[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.020]
He'll be in there every day and we just keep putting them out there and plugging away

[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:34.360]
But the guy who produced the best a pleasant surprise a miracle for us last year and by the way, how many of those goals were under power play

[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.060]
And this coach decides well

[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.880]
He don't want him to play the point on a power play because he's too small

[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.900]
He's too little in spite of the fact that all the goals he scored last year at a power play was playing the point at a power play

[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:51.180]
We got a coach who knows better from everybody, but I get the feeling he doesn't know anything about this team that he inherited

[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.820]
How could he not know he was the coach of the fires early in the season until he got his ass canned over there

[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.280]
He was the coach in Philadelphia they played us many times

[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.840]
He should have some idea who can do it on this team and who can't

[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.520]
In addition to which when your brother is the general manager and coach the team most of the last season

[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:14.420]
Don't you think you'd come over here and have some idea of who the guys are that can produce for you and who the guys are that are going through the motions

[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.020]
Who are doing the acid taken in moosey skating routine at center rice skating figure eights

[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.460]
Abisening for the Olympic winter skating

[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.600]
Give me a fricking break will you Terry Murray? Here we go again

[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.660]
Build them a nice hundred and eighty three million dollar arena

[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:35.280]
With problems which we've talked about to lumblul in a face. I'm trying to get them all straight not for you

[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.660]
So far doing a pretty damn good job if I say so myself

[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.960]
But like I said the other day now all we need is a team to play in that arena. That's what we need

[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.100]
And we got all these other guys that were desperate to get rid of that note that nobody else would take

[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:55.860]
Please take them just we don't want anything of return just take them and pay them their salary and though we don't want to receive them again

[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.400]
We got like six or seven of those guys

[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:07.620]
But here we go Brian Marie takes the top score that would be like Matt Sundine plays a bad guy for the main beliefs plays a bad game

[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.040]
Which he hasn't so far by the way

[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.120]
But he will does something everybody else does

[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:18.260]
And Pat quince is hey Matt you're sitting out the game with next game and then you're gonna come back

[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:24.400]
We're gonna put you on the check in line with Chris King and Ty do me here is that they would run him out of town on a rail in Toronto

[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.880]
They'd say if you lost and I'm not saying that Ray Whitney is mad sundine

[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.740]
But I'm just using examples who was the best player on whatever team it is last season

[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:42.880]
And this is what we get this is what you pay there are 57 bucks or whatever it is every goddamn game and your $10 to park and your

[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.840]
$20 for food or $40 for food for you got a family of more than one

[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.820]
So that we can go out there and see a bunch of again

[00:13:53.540 --> 00:14:00.040]
And I'll be there tomorrow night and I'm gonna tell you I may not be here Thursday or Friday because I may have your tea. I'll have laryngitis

[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:06.820]
Because my seats this year are instead of behind the penalty boxes like they used to be in the other joint they're behind the benches

[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.180]
And even though I'm 16 rows away

[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:17.680]
I'm gonna be screaming my goddamn lungs out at Terry fn Murray is what I'm gonna be doing because you're a fozo Terry

[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.580]
You're just like your brother in drag. Okay. You're our shimpleton

[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:30.420]
At least put the guys out there who can produce for you who play their guts out

[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:35.540]
Can anybody accuse Ray Whitney and not give it a hundred percent ever in any game since he's been on his team? No, of course not

[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:44.500]
But we get treated to the same guys who just the no can do guys night after night after night and we go out there last week

[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.180]
I could have I could have read you know these two books. I wish I would have bought them a few days earlier

[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.300]
I could have polished one book off their wins tonight any other one on Friday night. I could have been through both of those great books

[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.460]
Because I sure wouldn't have missed anything out there on the ice

[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.840]
Same old crap that we get treated to here in this town

[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.160]
So it's one thing to be a nice guy. It's another thing to have some idea what you're doing

[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:20.660]
How about Bench and Robbie need him or how about sitting in his big stupid medicine hat asked down on the down in a suit in the stand somewhere

[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.480]
Oh, and by the way, I just mentioned in passing like Lee Jay Cobb

[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.600]
I just mentioned in passing also and is one of the same articles by Mark and you know

[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.380]
Is the columnist the writers in this town they have nothing to say about this they have no opinion

[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.340]
They just print whatever they tell him to print

[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.700]
Unlike in a real sports town where every column has got opinions in it

[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:44.800]
Center Chris Wells hasn't played since March 26th and won't for nine to eleven more weeks

[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.700]
Wells underwent surgery Friday to repair a three-inch muscle tear in his abdomen

[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.800]
This is the same guy that Brian Murray told us he'd rather have Chris Wells after he made that awful trait

[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.480]
Then dug weight of the Edmonds and Euler who just signed a two-year contract for almost six million dollars

[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.660]
One of the best young players in the league

[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:05.960]
Who hasn't played a game for us since March 26th and even when he was playing couldn't do the job

[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:16.640]
They just keep lying and lying and lying and be asking you get Wayne with a Marlon song in a dance and expect you to come out and pay a lot of money for that

[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:22.680]
Which by the way and noticed after Hank said the story straight yesterday very jackass this tomorrow this morning suddenly decided in the hero

[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.620]
Oh, maybe the deal ain't got to go through who knows with John Henry

[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.500]
What a place what a town

[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.280]
1027 and 560 wqm

[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.180]
Where do you find a Goldberg right where you got it sports radio 560 q

[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.440]
A.m. Dale larger than god all my hundred dog friends out there

[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.380]
I've got some grit if your costs if you're looking for any time

[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:53.900]
Costs a cent round the clock for your give them a cough nine nine set for you

[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:59.260]
All right, thank you Joe Rose aka dwayne stomp nice going that was kind of like the end of our TV show last night

[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.040]
I guess they figured nobody could hear it anyway, so they just chopped up the end

[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.480]
It was like one minute. I'm with the beanie on the next minute. I'm not it was like a chop liver basically

[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.820]
1032 and 560 wqm don't forget our center one

[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.320]
Parents this Saturday at Ben and Jerry's in the adventurer from noon to two

[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.580]
Evan that I'm telling whatever they're drilling whatever construction is right now that thing is so loud

[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.040]

I heard it twice. I heard it once last week and I heard it again yesterday. Yeah. Well won't help

[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.720]
Okay. Okay. Thanks for the spire report. Okay. Anybody out there want to talk?

[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.480]
They would just want to do spire reports today

[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.900]
We want to talk about where do you park your uh thing in your vacuum? That's what we want to talk about five six seven oh five sixty

[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.860]
five sixty on the mobile one line

[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.780]
We got drilling going on over here. It sounds like they're blowing a god damn building up

[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.620]
It sounds like we're in the Aladdin casino in Vegas that they just blew down that god not soon enough either

[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.440]
What a place that was

[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.280]
Here's a mobile in Pember pine. Hello. Uncle Neil. Yes, sir

[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.760]
I wanted to see if you saw the article in the paper about the kid that college student

[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.360]
That uh, took a cat a caffeine overdose and died on a dare

[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.860]
Didn't see that yeah, it's in the day

[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:22.740]
I want pay what section. I don't remember I'm out in my car. I forgot. I just I thought you loved that one

[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.920]
I think the dare

[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.360]
Yeah, I'm of his friends really approximately 90

[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.340]
Phil almost the whole bottle

[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.160]
And he's dead and uh, nice he's dead

[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.460]
Okay, thanks for the good news. There you go. That's why they call institutions of higher learning

[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.960]
Because your kids are going off there seeing what assholes they can be how much booze they can drink

[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.740]
How many pills they can pop before they croak

[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:55.140]
Open line in day two and brown or five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line

[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.900]
Here's a mobile in Miramar. Hello

[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.900]
Neil yes, sir. I just wanted to call you. I was at the game Friday night. Yeah

[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:06.340]
And if you weren't there the only cheer that it got from a pants or fans is what messier made a goal right

[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.020]
That's right. What a bunch of dead people

[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.300]
Oh, I always wanted to stick it for giving to me thanks doctor. I wouldn't have paid for them

[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.560]
Like I said yesterday they should have given us refunds on a way outside the door saying we're very sorry

[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.160]
We hope you know we apologize for this and we pray it never happens again

[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.840]
Well, just keep short of the game. Do you give us all reason to cheer if you're there

[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.000]
Okay, I'll be there pal see you tomorrow night red wings see you here tomorrow night

[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.160]
We're playing the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions arguably the best team in league Detroit Redwings

[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.900]
And so naturally you want to put your best line about there against them

[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.760]
It's going to be one hell of a tough contest and no question about that

[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:51.720]
And we got a coach on and you know something the reason that this goes on an every aspect in politics with the fixed elections in Miami in baseball with

[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:56.580]
Trading away at the whole god damn team and giving you the worst record in a whole album a 54 and 108

[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:03.660]
After winning the world series and now this thing that they're doing of the hockey team the reason it goes on is because they can do it

[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.520]
Because this is a place where nobody even says anything even for free

[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:16.460]
For months I kept saying where is the outrage about what wing high pingo has done to the marlin? Where's the anger

[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.480]
Where's the outbreak could I find it no

[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.460]
And it's going to be the same thing here

[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:27.320]
Terry Murray is going to absolutely decimate and we you know not that we had that much to begin with to be honest with you

[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.840]
Except for a couple of promising rookies, but other than that

[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:35.280]
So he's going to decimate what little hopes we had and does anybody have anything to say about it? No as usual

[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.960]
You're just waiting for the steamroller to run over your ass and keep doing it. I enjoyed it. It's an S&M place

[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.880]
I'm finally catching on

[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.020]
Daydeline's open 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line

[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.240]
Here's Lake worth hello

[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:59.940]
Uncle Neil yes sir Andrew hey grew up so I'm using my real name again. Yes, please. How are you okay? Hey?

[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.660]
Just want to thank you because you were talking about that sports book yesterday

[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:10.500]
Not the sports book like where you bet, but the one with the the criminals. Oh, yeah, and there was a thing on Saturday night on

[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:17.280]
No Sunday night sports extra on channel five up here. Yeah, and the guy was talking to the author of the book

[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.160]
And so going out yesterday to get it after work and so I get to

[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.460]
One of those big bookstores not the one that's selling your CDs, right?

[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.420]
They didn't have anymore. They sold it yesterday. How do you like that?

[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:28.420]
So

[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:33.780]
But pros and cons the criminals will play at the NFL. But yeah, the author was talking about another story

[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.800]
You talked about the one who's talking about Cornelius Bennett

[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.560]
about how I don't know if you read it yet or not

[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.920]
How he had this conviction of a beat is white or something yeah, and

[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.360]
You know the NFL said they invent again all that and then when they author the book went to get the report

[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:53.720]
It took him an extra three days because nobody had gotten it yet because they had to blow out all the names out and stuff. Oh, there you go

[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.600]
So but another funny thing with that channel five thing

[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.140]
I'm watching it and I'm half asleep. It's 11 30 at night

[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.620]
The broadcaster talking about the top five and the eight people or whatever right

[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:09.980]
And all of a sudden he looks at he goes. I know what you are wondering how it can just take it all those effing votes

[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.820]
He said effing yeah

[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.160]
Let me tell five let's hear it for channel five

[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.440]
I'm right and one more thing

[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.880]
Yeah, I got you on the phone. I'm talking a while

[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.000]
I don't know if you caught the sports report on the show this morning, but uh

[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.840]
LT who didn't do any drugs and he was all set up by the cops checked in the rehab this morning. How about that?

[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.400]
Put anyway, but I shot maybe you can go to work on power 96

[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.800]
Okay, and we're have a great deal of life take care of see you

[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.900]
We have an open line and date one and brown and five six seven oh five

[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.820]
Why am I talking so loud because they've drilling us no seriously you start talking louder and louder and pretty

[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.240]
So I'm gonna lose my voice before the hockey game tomorrow night

[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.420]
Before I get a chance to cuss out old to TM get that out of here. We are

[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.520]
Listen to that the god damn building is shaken here the foundation to this you and her like

[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.080]
How why can't we just to play some music here?

[00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.480]
La music of our lives, huh?

[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.880]
There you go get out of here

[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:08.200]
This one of the very few things good you can say about the Tampa Bay area is the fact that they got staking shake and they have

[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.320]
And they also have even those little a crystal which you know Wayne Arles is better

[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.880]
But Wayne's only got one joint but any part of time you're in you pull into a crystal you get 400 hamburgers to go

[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.960]
And those cheese fries see that's one thing Wayne's got to work on getting cheese fries like they have a crystal

[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.080]
Those are good they'll kill you, but god damn are those good

[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.920]
But anyway, it says staking shake a long time fixture in central florida and the Midwest is right away. Are at stake in shake

[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.040]
To date brown and pom beach counties do we have anybody that makes milkshakes? No, thank god

[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.680]
We don't have no sponsors that make milkshakes. Do we do we uh?

[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.780]
Oh, oh, thank god

[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.840]
The chain which is partly publicly helped consolidated products hold its summer

[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:50.640]
The company is scouting the area's top growth markets including Kendall, Evan Tura, Sunrise, Pembroke Pines, Crossbrings and Boca Raton

[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.340]
And I'm sure that when they say you know it would be a great place for staking shake

[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.700]
You know where the Boston market went out of business right across the street from me by my bank

[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:04.760]
Oh, and guess what's opening right next door to there since every inch of land out there in uh, Pembroke in

[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:09.840]
Plantation acres and Sunrise is being bought up and commercialized guess what's open and right there

[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.600]
Granny a Denny's

[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:18.780]
Am I gonna be eating that great pie a Denny's? No, I don't think so. How about those grand slab breakfast, huh? No

[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.500]
I'll slam that right on the floor with the heel of your foot. No, I don't think so

[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.120]
Well wouldn't that be great where the Boston market went out of business there? What a shame

[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:34.580]
I tried my best I spent a lot of money here in Boston market. Did it help? No, but at any rate that would be a perfect spot for a staking shake. I'm starting to check it about it

[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.020]
Here's a mobile and crossbrings. Hello

Where most of the people have to gum their food. They've always been nervous about that, you know

[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.580]
But I think what they're gonna do is they're gonna like give you a little glass with a fizzy uh, substance in it

[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.200]
So you're teeth while you're gumming the food okay, and the drive through

[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:47.580]
Hey, one more one more other thing. I see where our power per hour jury gives car max 50 million dollars right

[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.580]

[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:55.240]
Even if it even if it don't stand up. It's gonna make him you know have sleepless nights which we like a lot

[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.280]
I call my wife Veronica a douchebag and the fact that there's stockies in the toilet too

[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:05.940]
You like a lot too. No, you can't do that. Okay. We have an open line and brown. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line

[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.700]
Well, I think that would be a great spot

[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.980]
Why were that boss the nice red brick building brand new spotless in there?

[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.380]
Huh in fact really when you look at the because if you're familiar

[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.420]
You've been in steak and shake or you don't even to me

[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.200]
I mean we just a little work on the exterior and the sign and the whole deal. It's ready to go

[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.120]
Steak and shake. Oh, yes, you know the thank next door is closed

[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:43.380]
The one with the parking lot that we're gonna have to lease to right the people are stupid question. We've been working here 10 months

[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:48.600]
And every day when I come to work and I pass the the the truck sub shop right in the corner there

[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.120]
We love your truck and DC and I make my turn on the 441

[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:58.820]
I see the sign that says Walgreens coming soon now. Maybe there I'm there. It's open. It is yeah

[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:04.160]
I put these cop cops there how we supposed to know that it's open the signs is

[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:09.420]
By the parking lot real slow like I did and now you don't want to try to get the car at least moving

[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.840]
Don't stop to a can don't make all four wheels come to a home

[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:19.620]
So the Walgreens is actually open because I was gonna say that would be a great place for a steak and shake right next door just about

[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:25.680]
Here's a crawl spring. Hello. Hello there. Yes, sir. I had a bunch of things on a lift here

[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.020]
I wanted to talk about one with the steak and shake I can see one right here in Carl Springs on university

[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.240]
I can't wait okay

[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.760]
I think that's just like that fact I think what we ought to do is we'll send them we'll make down a list of locations

[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.460]
We'll tell them where to a stick it we could do they work for them why should they look we tell them where we're gonna be and band they build them well

[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.080]
Tell them exactly where to stick it if you haven't by Christmas time right

[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:50.260]
The uh the thing about Wayne I think that's wonderful right? His own backyard. He got to start

[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.880]
So don't expect any great thing to happen with the hockey team now

[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.480]
You can have just that 15 million on this uh, I never I never thought about that. That's right right?

[00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.520]
I've got another reason another excuse

[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:07.120]
One thing you never talk about I went you have for why I haven't heard I want to meet me to ask you at the new arena is the silver fox there

[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:14.160]
I have you know something other than mr. Mrs. Howard Kleinberg who have the mispevencee anybody from the other side that I remember from the old 106

[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:20.320]
Nobody and I look over there once in a while and it's a long you know my eyesight's pretty good and I don't see any of that crowd

[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.160]
Right whose daughter got married whose son grew up with a baby right?

[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:29.220]
Not only that but the fact that when people show up year after year they have a passion for it. They have a feeling for it

[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.300]
There's none of that here

[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.720]
Because you know they show up whenever they can get a ticket and uh and that's it

[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.060]
That's because they because that this yeah that's right

[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.480]
Well the pia the

[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:48.220]
They can stick it's worth 13 million what is McGlyre worth what is so so worth what is Kevin Brown who's gonna be our free agent

[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.980]
Who's are gonna be signing for a ton of money?

[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:56.080]
Al lighter is worth eight million dollars a year. I mean he's an ice sky for six but Al lighter is worth eight million

[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.380]
Jesus what are we talking about

[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.140]
Absolutely good luck to his pal okay ticket yeah

[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:06.240]
All me first it up. That's right thank God that the station's behind those tickets

[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:12.700]
I mean it's it's just out of control you keep wanting more and more of our money and like last night

[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.960]
Okay, I did watch the leaves and a pen wins and a pen was played well, but to be honest with it was a very boring game

[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.260]
It was coma inducing

[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:24.260]
And there have been so many of these rift I watched hardly a finished beat the crap out of the

[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:31.420]
Colorado again walk five of the first seven games by the way only one win Patrick frogs let him in the bowling balls are going through his legs for gold

[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:37.000]
And the crowd is booing and screaming and when they're in Denver their psychotic

[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:42.840]
I mean the quality of the product out there is getting worse and worse and you can talk all you want well

[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.700]
We're five and two the dolphin to England game the first three quarters you could have taken a book

[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.040]
You could have taken a pillow and had a good nap and missed nothing

[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:54.900]
And I mean somewhere along the hill it would be like going into a restaurant where the food used to be really great

[00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:03.460]
And every time you go it gets a little bit worse and a little bit worse and the portions get a little bit smaller to the point where and the prices by the way keep going up

[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.040]
Keep going up

[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:14.280]
And the state that used to be 25 bucks now it's 50 bucks, but they give you like a little tiny turd in the middle of a plate and say here you go

[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:20.120]
Take it or lump it and that's what they're doing with sports and they just can't figure out why people get a little bit enchanted

[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.900]
Here's North Miami Beach hello

One more time it's 1102 at 560 wqm. We have an open line of day five six seven oh five here's North Miami. Hello

[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:25.340]
Hey, no, yes, sir. That was a great call you had your last call. That was great call. You're the best

[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:31.880]
Uh, he's counting bus driver serve you ever noticed how many uh Chinese bus drivers there are for school buses in this

[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:33.840]
You better get busy

[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:35.800]
Listen

[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.580]
I have a story here that I just saw in sports center

[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:45.860]
It kind of coincides with everything you've been talking about with you know alcohol and uh, you know that book about the NFL player

[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:51.900]
There's a Leonard Lutil who plays for the St. Louis Ram. Yeah the woman died by the way

[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:56.200]
And by the way, we had the story wrong on this radio station

[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:01.640]
We had the story wrong several days ago when he announced that all he was not under the influence and no charges of being filed

[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.860]
Guess what surprise

[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.160]
Twice about the legal limit right now

[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:12.900]
Maybe he could be a school bus driver. He is black. There you go. In fact, uh excellent idea. There you go

[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.160]
Okay, thanks for the good news

[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:20.400]
All these all these dark-complexed guys who just have problems, baby

[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.960]
Who just aren't good role models for our kids? Well, let's not make a role model. Let's just make them a bus drivers

[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.600]
That sounds logical. I mean nobody you know

[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:33.640]
It might read Myers the bus driver who don't pay his attention to the bus driver and most of the kids resent them anyway

[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.140]
Because they're trying to like you know keep them in line

[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.900]
So let's have all these guys driving a goddamn bus and then this guy that called two calls ago

[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.580]
He can start counting like crazy. There goes another guy damn one right now

[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.800]

[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.520]
I mean it was a very boring weekend because I was here in town. So what else am I gonna do? I just thought

[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:11.600]
Tee I'm gonna watch that damn thing and it was great. Yeah, and there's a longer version available

[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:17.920]
She'd buy the DVD. Yeah, which is out now, but I haven't got a DVD play any good. Why? But eventually maybe

[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.080]
I was

[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:24.740]
Bucket and his put oh, I guess she's got a greater claim to fame than the than the time

[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.140]
Well, whatever whatever she was doing even it was like just a home video

[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.640]
She probably had more viewers than then she's got now obviously

[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:36.160]
That's a lot of course that news guys one thing if you if you add all the different times that it's on

[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.000]
It's like mash if you put all the times mash is on they probably got about a four share

[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:48.020]
Huh sure cuz that's four times one is four last time I checked in fact if they would put us on 30 times

[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:52.880]
We'd still have a nobody can hear the guy damn audio so 30 times zero is still that's right

[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:58.580]
No, it's in like I said why do I give myself worked up into a leather about these things

[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:02.300]
They put together a pretty good show there until the very end last night when they were doing the Joe Rose

[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:07.220]
Dwayne stomping and chopping uh, you know, I figure who the hell cares now by this time everybody's turned it off

[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.400]
Anyway, nobody can hear it

[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:12.440]
But other than that it was pretty entertaining. I'm sitting there with a chicken on my head

[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:17.600]
I mean where else in America can you watch your guys sitting there make a jackass of himself what a chicken on his head

[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.360]
Probably at television first

[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:26.980]
But was there anybody watching? No, of course not you can't hear the guy damn thing if you want to hear it

[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:32.300]
Hmm and the and the hum keeps getting louder and louder and louder

[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:37.480]
In fact, maybe that's the idea just stick your on the TV screen get a good hum job there for the prices right

[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:43.080]
And nobody cares nobody that and I said to George this morning

[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:49.240]
I need help I really do I need psychiatric counseling not as a person but as somebody who lives here

[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:56.400]
Because in order to survive in this town you have to be willing to lower your standards

[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.160]
I'm not talking about being better than anybody else or goody-toos shoes

[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:04.220]
But you have to lower your standards to such a low degree that you don't give a anymore. You just don't care

[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.980]
Like my good friends there at Pompato Park. I listen

[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.100]
I don't want to bore you with the because it's the pressing place to begin with

[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:17.040]
But I'm telling you everything that I deal with practically in this town is doing and people that you're trying to do a job for

[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.380]
And they still don't want to give you any copy any information

[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.580]
It's like oh, we don't know what you're talking about what you bothering us for

[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:28.320]
That that's the mentality in this time. What are you bothering us for?

[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.260]
Just dummy up and go spend your money and have a great life and leave us alone

[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:39.080]
But I'm trying to do a job for ever get about it. We don't care. We just go through the motions anyway

[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.120]
No matter what it is

[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:47.920]
Like this radio station we got so many people that are just content to go through the motions and if you open up a mouth

[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:53.060]
You're a bastard. I mean, I know that there are people that hate me like poison in this place. Do I care? No, of course not

[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.240]
I couldn't give a crap less

[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.840]
And that's my big mistake

[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:01.220]
You're supposed to be part of our fraternity. You're not supposed to be trying to do a professional job

[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.680]
Stop making so much goddamn trouble and I'm not just talking about here. I'm talking about it

[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.900]
It's like the thing with the panthers. I haven't had one call here today on that

[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.300]
Not one

[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:13.640]
Not one

[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:20.060]
Did I give him a chance in the beginning you bet? I said hey is a good guy. I met him. I had a couple of good conversations

[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.920]
I think he's better new people think

[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.080]
Let's give him a chance and then we'll uh, shoot him okay

[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.120]
Because he's a bozo

[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:33.300]
Taking our best player stick him on a bench stick him on the fourth line with a couple of goons on a goon line

[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.540]
And then of course he's gonna be saying well it's not scoring

[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:40.180]
Well, how the hell's he gonna score when he's playing with a couple of uh, goofballs out there

[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:45.120]
That's like the leafsay, but you know tie. Don't be you're not scoring enough goals. You're not gonna play anymore

[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.080]
What the hell is that?

[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:54.360]
And these people are nothing phases them. They're perfect for this town. I apologize. I'm the one that's out of place

[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:59.460]
You guys you're in the right place those days when we have no guy damn calls it off

[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:05.640]
That's perfect. That's a perfect reflection of what this town is all about you can do anything to this community

[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.500]
And they don't care they take it without so much as a whimper

[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:15.880]
Fixed elections. I mean you name it drugs all over the goddamn place kids getting killed on street corners

[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.120]
Don't bother us with these things you're too goddamn negative

[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.120]
Sorry

[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.200]
Mr

[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:24.820]
Sorry

[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:30.740]
Eight minutes after broadcasting whether it was Camilla Sonser Center, Wonder whatever the charity was

[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.160]
We used to get a nice check from the sales manager

[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:38.340]
The program director which we did get bluff. Thank you bluff. You're the only one the only person

[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:43.500]
At WQAIM who donated a dime to our charity so far is bluff Lindsay

[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.920]
Does that tell you what you need to know about this place? Uh-huh

[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:52.520]
And how involved we are in this radio station? Uh-huh. I mean we I don't care what we said in that meeting on Friday

[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:57.000]
And by the way, I wish I had on tape we'd get a 90 share we just put it on a whammy

[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.820]
I wish I had that meeting on tape not the part with me and the Greg Reed the part with normal Kent

[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:04.720]
I

[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.080]
I just want to tell all of you out there including people who hate me like Poison maybe the feeling is mutual

[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.780]
I wouldn't wish Norma can't on any of you okay

[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.820]
Here is a man the worst thing that ever happened to this guy is that he had a few uh

[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.540]
In those shows on FTL and we really think he was in radio

[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:22.140]
He thinks he was a broadcast. I've been telling him over and over again

[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.160]
You weren't even close to being on radio

[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:28.820]
FTL was to radio what whammy is to television. It's not even on the edge, okay

[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.940]
It's not even in the same league. It's not in the same business. It's not in the same vocabulary

[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.020]
It's way on the outside looking in

[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:43.660]
And we're talking about the situation with a hurricane for example and about how the station is ill prepared to cover like the unnatural

[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:45.720]
Disasters hurricanes wars, etc

[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.660]
And maybe the way we ought to approach that

[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:54.140]
And Norma to give you one of his classic lines says we can all like hanker come on here and say there's a high fly ball

[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.880]
The right field is back by and the wind is blowing it's uh because we got the hurricane coming

[00:41:59.000 --> 00:41:59.320]
You

[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.420]
Part is he's serious

[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.900]
I said norm

[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.640]
Shut up

[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:14.360]
In fact if I could tell you how many times I said that during that meeting see one good thing is that I never hear from him

[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.980]
Unless I call him like remember you gave me that message you have the day from somebody who's interested in

[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:22.160]
Sinocheting our show and I gave it right to him that was on Friday when he was here if I heard from him since no

[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.460]
I hear from him unless I call him first and I'm gonna chase him down a waste my time anymore. No, of course not

[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.320]
He is perfect for this town. He fits in here like a glove

[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:39.980]
Just don't do it like Nancy Reagan would say it kind of like us take off on it no matter what it is fill in the blank just don't do it

[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.920]
And it won't get done and everybody'll say okay fine

[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:50.100]
We have an open line in date count the high fly ball to right field it's going and the wind takes hold of it and it's hurricane

[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:54.100]
Fill in the blanket and that's how hanker cover the hurricane

[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:56.480]
Okay

[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.880]
He was serious

[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.060]
Okay, we're two of Miami. Hello

[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:07.920]
Up to me. I don't know. Okay, sir. Up to me. I saw a report. I can't believe they actually paid Mike Piazza 91 million dollars

[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:14.860]
Why not I can't believe it why not when you got Mark McWire semi-sosa they did a story on them can take up a collection

[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:20.480]
I mean Tiger always has no crap. Mm-hmm. I mean it's I think it probably has a crap every now and then

[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:25.800]
Take a shake like it's coming down here for real. That's what it says oh wow

[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:30.360]
Maybe 20 locations by next summer. Well, maybe we get calls junior two all right

[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:35.600]
Hey, they bought out hearty so we can get that we can get those ebonyk burgers, baby. All right, baby

[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.940]
E. coli burgers. Yeah, okay, have a great day. Get out here

[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.840]
We have an open line two of mintade County boy. I keep burning myself on these goddamn matches

[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:47.740]
I'm pretty sorry. I'm not gonna have no fingers left five six seven oh five sixty see that's God punishing you mr

[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.300]
For smoke and those goddamn cigars those stogies and

[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.700]
And pond five sixty on the 18t wireless line. Here's a bokeh. Hello

[00:43:55.700 --> 00:44:01.520]
Neil yes, sir, and I respond to what you said about the Panthers earlier this morning. Uh-huh

[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:05.420]
Um, this isn't one of our chronics is it no, oh I'm in bokeh

[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:06.580]
um

[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:13.340]
Ray Whitney was on there with Guilty between period the other night of the Vancouver Gambia. Yeah, and

[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.300]
I don't know what what did they end up paying Ray Whitney?

[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.740]
One practice every game he gives 200 percent

[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.660]
He's a you know because he's been put in a position being a little guy

[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:28.100]
He has to try twice as hard as the bigger guys in order to make it because he thought his career was over when Edmond

[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:32.260]
And cut him and then we picked him up and he had the opportunity made the most of it and keep in mind

[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:37.060]
Keep in mind that Ray Whitney accomplished what he'd last year on a crappy team

[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:41.660]
I mean, it's one thing to get those statistics on a hell of a team like stew barns did plan with you know

[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:45.520]
Francis and yogurt, but when you accomplish it on a team where nobody else is doing much of anything

[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:50.500]
He was like a one-man offensive show for us on the team that stunk and he still is right

[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.960]
Well, he can't do it on a bench and he certainly can't do it on a fourth line play with Peter or Ellen dwayne

[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.260]
Hey, no to me ray Whitney's the bench forechecker. We have on the team

[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:02.100]
I see the punch was you could have seen the two games that he played against the Leaf Saturday and last night

[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.100]
Marty struck a he and he's on the number one line. Isn't it interesting?

[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:11.180]
Yarmour yoghurt who played great last night with stew barns and Marty struck a that's the number one line for the penguins in their play

[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:14.580]
I'm pretty then good. Yeah, but Marty struck Chris Wells you got confused

[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:19.800]
Chris Wells who hasn't played a game for this team since March 26th who's injured every day

[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.380]
And who even when he wasn't injured before he got hurt was sitting in the stands in a suit every night

[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:27.100]
And we'd rather have him than Doug Wade. I mean these guys

[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:33.660]
I'm gonna tell you, Brian Marie and Terry Marie were in a real hockey town doing the things that they've been doing last couple of years

[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:37.920]
They'd have been out of town on a rail. I'm telling you which is why they have been no not raised out of town

[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:44.180]
Everywhere they've been you know Ray Whitney and a couple of these new kids other than that

[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.020]
There's really you're right. There's nobody to watch offensively because there's nothing going on

[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:53.220]
We'll cover spokesman to get his finger out of it. Okay, we'll do it. Shea the spokesman. I you know something

[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.840]
I'm glad I didn't throw those buttons away

[00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:01.880]
In fact, I still have that cardboard sign in my card says you know no BM. We're gonna have to get one that says no TM too

[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:07.020]
Because these guys are determined that they're gonna be they're gonna show what these guys they're gonna get

[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:12.660]
If you're gonna send a message to somebody don't do it by mentioning the guys with the best players on the team do it by

[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.640]
Bention the guys who are sticking the joint out

[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:20.060]
Stick Robby Neeter why is that you'll get a standing ovation if you have the guts to let Terry Marie

[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:25.180]
But you don't have the balls to do it stick his ass on a bench and don't tell me how great he played against the caps on Friday

[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:30.580]
Okay, one game don't make a career one assist one easy pass to a guy wide open in front of the net

[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:33.880]
Doesn't make a guy damn case for a guy that's getting two and a half million dollars a year

[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:41.180]
And isn't it interesting how they gave that niggeredly amount to Ray Whitney and they practically took him right down to arbitration

[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:47.240]
And then like two or three days before and the only reason the only reason that they settled and made that deal with him before

[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:53.340]
And arbitration is that caused the days before that mark reky and pierre turjango those gigantic record breaking settlement

[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:56.580]
Oh awarded by the arbitrators and they were peeing in their pants

[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.580]
That Whitney might get two three million dollars a year if they went to arbitration. So they said okay, we'll do this

[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:07.220]
And for my opinion Whitney's agent knuckled under two we took two little money

[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:11.820]
But let's punish the guys who were working for two little and who are working their guts out us

[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:15.780]
Let's punish them and try to make an example out of them and the guys who are making the most money on the things

[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:21.180]
We don't do a squat out there. Let's reward them by playing them put the stick in them out there over it over it over again

[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:26.740]
I'm telling you better be prepared for Thursday and Friday because after tomorrow night. I'm gonna be so horse

[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.220]
I'm gonna be a horse with uh, I got covered

[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:34.040]
With the name we have an open line and date one and brown

[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.260]
Here's Davie hello

[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:43.680]
Davie feel yes sir. Hey, how are you okay? Uh, if there's a lot of you mentioned something about hurricane

[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.080]
It's funny. I was watching

[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:49.920]
Do it 180 around oh, yeah, that's right channel four in channel seven

[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:53.720]
I stopped a little bit a little brain last night. He's on air. He's got his suit on

[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:58.760]
He's all right. He looks like John glenny looks like he's getting ready to take off in the space shuttle and he don't need a shuttle

[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:03.000]
But at any rate, yeah, he's hyperventling. They're getting ready for it to do a big twist in a turn

[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:09.380]
That's a really not cool. Yeah, I'd like to answer the old guy that's counting how many black school bus drivers there are. Yeah

[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:13.020]
There are zero assholes all school buses are yellow

[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.040]
But uh never thought about that's right

[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:23.000]
Anyway, what about those Chinese? I got to go judge Joe bros coming up. Okay, see you

[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:23.920]
Oh

[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:32.000]
We have an open line indeed one and broward five six seven oh five six to the pound five six to the on the eight

[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:39.040]
That's the kind of people we have in this town are people sitting around looking out the window counting the number of

[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.820]
black school bus drivers

[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:47.420]
Does that tell you all you need to know about this town? Yeah, you'll bet your sweet fat ass it does

[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:53.200]
people with no lives. That's why there's no passion here. Whoever

[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.960]
hurt a dead people have in passion. There's no emotion. There's no

[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.320]
feeling. There's no outrage. There's no anything. There's no

[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.460]
good passion. There's no bad passion. There's no even mediocre

[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:09.420]
lukewarm passion. And I said here, air be gods and they have

[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:14.800]
my life screaming and puking and yelling. And I hear often

[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.620]
that, you know, the response like screaming into a god damn

[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.480]
tunnel and you hear like in a back. Yeah, that's it. That's

[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:26.980]
what you get back. That's the echo. Man, QA. The media

[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:31.820]
system needs help badly. 560 WQM boy. Is this phone smoking

[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:34.300]
or what? No. Open line and Broward all three and dead again.

[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.360]
I guess everybody had decided to take some time off and go out

[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.220]
and start counting school bus drivers. Yeah, let's take a poll

[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.200]
on that. What do you think? Let's go out there in a corner,

[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.500]
standing on the corner, watching all the school bus drivers go

[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:50.000]
by and taking notes. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T

[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.060]
wireless line. Here's Coral Springs. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes,

[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:56.640]
sir. How you doing, buddy? Okay. How do we look for the

[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.460]
buses that there are the cops in every corner hiding behind

[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:03.720]
the bush? Yeah. Yeah. So a rocha toy don't annoy on the

[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:12.180]
goi. The pants just go all the way and the Murphy suck. Okay,

[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.300]
we have that that's that was our hockey call right there.

[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.080]
The Murphy suck. Okay, Brian Murphy and Terry Murphy or

[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.820]
I guess who that is talking about. I'm not talking about

[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:22.260]
Gordy is yet. I don't think so. There's one of our see,

[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.200]
that's why you can't discuss anything in this time because

[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:26.520]
nobody knows what you're talking about. They have all those

[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.920]
people that show up and I keep asking that question. I really

[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:33.920]
don't know why. Two open lines into the lady mobile in West

[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:41.100]
Palm Beach. Hello. Lady mobile in West Palm Beach. Long gone.

[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:42.740]
Okay, like I said.

[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:52.300]
Goes over time to go home. We'll see you.

[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:15.380]
Welcome to Miami. All you turn this out there. The average

[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:20.060]
average person driver out there. They've been dead for at least 10

[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.960]
years. Nobody told him.

[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:33.940]
I mean, this is this is just unbelievable. It really is. 5 6 7 0 5 6

[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:35.980]
D are you following me? Am I giving these numbers too fast? Is

[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:41.460]
that the problem? 5 6 7 0 5 6 D. Palm 5 6 D on the AT&T

[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.500]
wireless line. I must be missing something. Oh, we're not

[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:46.220]
talking about John Glenn. Is he too old? Yeah, we already know

[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:49.860]
that. I keep every time I see John Glenn on TV. I get that

[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:53.280]
sound keeps coming into my mind. Just like that. I don't know

[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:59.040]
what that means. Here's West Palm Beach. Hello. Hey, Neil.

[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.620]
It's right. It's what?

[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:03.400]
It's me Mike. I'm West Palm Beach. I guess something to tell you.

[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.520]
I've been seeing on the television. You know, MCI commercial. Yeah.

[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.680]
When it has many in devil. We've been around in Michael Jordan.

[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.780]
Till them. Hey, you know, you pay too much. You could have used

[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:16.660]
MCI to the AT&T. Yeah. And these are the words that he says.

[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:19.220]
You know, but we know that it has many in devil. That's the

[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:24.500]
English. But he says, bag it. Mag it. Have you heard that? No,

[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.300]
I have not. Yes. See if you can get that. It's bag it. Magnet.

[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:30.540]
Must be talking about loose Taylor. Okay, let's tell our loose all

[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:34.900]
about it. Okay, two open lines in date 5 6 7 0 5 6 8 0 5 5 6

[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:39.180]
6 8 0 3 and day. Like I said, 72 open lines in date 5 6 7 0 5 6

[00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:43.200]
8 0 5 6 8 on the AT&T wireless line. If even be as good as that last

[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.840]
color, then save it. Here's a mobile and point and V.

[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:51.520]
Chilo. I'm trying to hear about the pictures about the

[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:55.420]
lower on the internet. How about the one? There's pictures of

[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:58.220]
Dr. Laura on the internet. Yeah, somebody packs me that stuff and I

[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:01.440]
found it very boring. Oh, I got the. Laura's very boring. Who cares

[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:05.580]
about Dr. Laura? Yeah. Well, I know you talk about it once in a

[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:08.400]
while. So I just figured it be. You know, you might want to check it

[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.960]
out. No, I don't think so. Thank you. Okay, we have an open line at

[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.220]
Broward to a search. They're searching. They're reaching. They're

[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:15.300]
grasping. They sure don't want to talk about any of the stuff I talked

[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:18.120]
about. So another all searching and reaching. I thought that by

[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:21.000]
far the most simulating call we had was about the black school

[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:25.340]
bus drivers. Right? Let's hear it for that guy. You know,

[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.280]
something you guys thought that he was bad, but at least he called

[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:30.760]
that something I'll say for him. He may not have had much material,

[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:33.560]
but he had the courage of his own goddamn convictions and his

[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:38.400]
six X Y's. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hey, how you doing?

[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.320]
No, I probably we're doing okay there. For about an hour and a half

[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:44.440]
and all of a sudden we ran into a goddamn brick wall. Oh, well, I

[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:48.160]
can't. The thing with Whitney is really it's so annoying. Right,

[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.980]
you and I must be the only ones who care. There's nobody in that

[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.560]
whole crowd that shows up. Airby home game. Nobody else seems to

[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.140]
give a crap. They've got no opinion. I mean, he was the hardest

[00:53:56.140 --> 00:54:00.580]
worker. He makes plays and guys like Kanye, Kanye is just about

[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:03.900]
five open necks. You two might have to sleep out there and they

[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:07.260]
take Whitney out. Yeah. Just. And then he's going to put it back

[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:09.820]
in on the significance of that. What is he going to accomplish

[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:12.900]
out there playing on a line with two goon? He's a playmaker. And

[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:16.200]
in a day with as you know, as anybody who knows about the game,

[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:19.060]
even a little bit, the fourth line plays very little during a game.

[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.980]
So how much ice time is he going to? Okay. Thanks. Thank you so

[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:25.520]
much. What do you say? He said shut sound like he said

[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.560]
something else. We have an open line and Broward to endate

[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:31.980]
of his line. Wow. If we had a run here or nerve here today, no,

[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:36.240]
sure haven't. Here's Miami. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I was

[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:40.480]
fire report for you. Yeah. I was passing by T. P. Park this

[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:45.280]
morning at 8.50. Yes. And there were like 200 buzzers.

[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.360]
Circling the air above the stadium. Yeah. Could imagine what

[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:56.240]
was happening. I thought that Mr. Heising had expired because of

[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:02.080]
the 50 million judgment. But what it was is that the parking lots

[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:09.060]
there had garbage. A mile high. Oh my God. Yeah. And the buzzers

[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:13.740]
were just circling over that neighborhood. I can imagine that

[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:19.740]
the residents in the nearby community must be a gas. They must

[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:23.360]
be a gas. Yeah. Maybe this is Wayne's idea to get him all to

[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.880]
move out. Okay. We have an open line and Broward all of

[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:28.600]
day advice line. We were rolling along singing a song here

[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:31.980]
doing just fine and all of a sudden that was it. Somebody pulled

[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:36.240]
a goddamn plug on his audience today. Somebody pulled a guy

[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.380]
right out from underneath me. They pulled a goddamn magic

[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:42.580]
carpet right underneath my goddamn feet. Here's Coral

[00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:46.120]
Springs. Hello. We take these fast. I can get out here by

[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:51.060]
noon. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Okay. Okay. That was kind of

[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:53.720]
interesting. The buzzers over P. P. Park. Yeah. It's funny

[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.740]
because I drove by P. P. Park this morning on the way to work

[00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:57.920]
like I do every day. I didn't see no buzzers. I didn't see no

[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.280]
garbage. Maybe this guy had a bad dream. Maybe got into a bad

[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.700]
good bullet grits and it gave him the rimes with grits. Maybe

[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:06.460]
the buzzers were left over from that first half that they

[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:12.220]
played. Could be. But to get back to here. Yeah. Because I

[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:16.000]
go to Georgia every year for Thanksgiving dinner and kind of

[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.260]
about four days up there and yet they're very helpful. So it's

[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:22.440]
the restaurant that has good food. But you're drinking stuff

[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.960]
other than getting low. What do you mean they don't serve

[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.060]
alcohol? I can't think of any fast food places that serve

[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:29.440]
alcohol. Well, it's not what is that mean. I think any of the

[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.340]
they don't serve booze. Well, and that atmosphere was that

[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:36.640]
you have someone. Thank you. Okay, that's good. We have an

[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.660]
old love. It's here for Stake and Chase. They got no booze.

[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:43.700]
I'm serious. It's terrifying. It really scares the crap out

[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.460]
of me when I think about the fact that these people are out

[00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:48.560]
there. We have an open line and Howard. All three lines in

[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.120]
brick wall. You want to know why? Because we started talking

[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:56.300]
about. Sorry. Never again. We'll never do that again. Okay.

[00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:58.680]
You're off the hook, Terry Murray, because this is a time

[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:01.880]
where nobody cares because nobody knows. How the hell can you

[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:04.360]
have passion about something and feel excited or pissed off

[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.660]
or whatever when you don't even know what that's all about?

[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:13.400]
Man, oh, man, a chevets. It is just on effing believable.

[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:21.000]
No, it's not 21 to me. Oh, God. All right.

[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:42.560]
I'm a space. My life's loving you. If I were a car,

[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:49.740]
I'd be the good boy to. And what it's time to head south and

[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:55.260]
around. I want to go wherever living is for them.

[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:14.620]
I'm on that kid's mind. I'm on a hill where even we all can't

[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:20.140]
have fun like my writing from me. On those bones and

[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:25.240]
rails. I want to die. Oh, it's

[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:29.320]
right on. Oh, I want to die.

[00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:02.680]
I want to spend my life loving you. If I were a car,

[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:09.860]
I'd be the good boy to. And what it's time to head south and

[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:16.980]
around. I want to go wherever living is for them. I want to

[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:23.420]
die. Oh, right. Oh, we're fine.

[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:23.420]

[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:31.220]
I want to die. I want to die.

[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:37.980]
And the best part of it is I'm on that hill.

[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.520]
I want to die. I want to die. I want to die.

[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:48.620]
I want to die. I want to die. I want to die.

[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:50.760]
John Levy, by the way, gave this to me. Was it you that

[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:54.520]
that woman calling up asking you that day? Yes. Where this came from and

[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:57.460]
where I got used to sing it at the clubs. I wasn't the voice that

[00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:01.860]
recorded it. And John, 11, my former fat producer, who was

[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.880]
somewhat of a musician, myself, I see him, self is kind of like a

[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.280]
Jim Morrison junior, sort of only fat and ugly. But at any rate,

[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.240]
he's the one that gave that to me years ago. And as you heard,

[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:13.360]
the car that it was originally on very poorly erased and it adds

[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.800]
to the ambiance. I love it. It makes it what it is a piece of

[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.920]
We have two open lines and date five six seven oh five sixty

[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:24.580]
five sixty on the AT&T wireless line. Any interest today? No. Here's

[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:31.100]
Hollywood. Hello. Hollywood. Going once. Neil. Yes, sir.

[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.460]
I'm kind of about proposition nine of the constitutional

[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:38.140]
revisions of the state. Have you read that? No, I have not. No, I

[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:41.700]
have not. It's got very strange wording about basic rights. Yeah.

[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:45.900]
And in parentheses, it has defines natural persons as female and

[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:51.540]
male alike. Yeah. Mean that they're taking away rights for they

[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:55.400]
could define natural persons as somebody that's been circumcised for

[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.200]
one thing. Well, they could define natural persons as somebody

[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.060]
that's a transsexual. Right. Or we could just forget about it.

[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:04.060]
Okay, we have an open line in Broward to and date five six seven oh five

[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:07.320]
sixty and pound five six the on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a

[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.740]
saga bay. Hello. Neil, didn't you say the other day our lady built

[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:15.260]
that chicken had to war last night? What about it?

[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.340]
Didn't all lady construct that? Yeah, it's a work of art. Uh-huh.

[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:22.800]
I thought last night it was the best thing. You're the one who was

[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.820]
watching the TV show last night. I always know you couldn't hear the

[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:30.460]
sound. The sound is pathetic. I used to be an audio engineer for broadcast

[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:34.840]
station. Yes. How could a TV station screw up something like that

[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.160]
and allow it to go? The night after night after night. And you know

[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.460]
something nobody cares. The people over there don't care. The

[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:45.240]
audience doesn't care. Nobody cares. My my crack attorney there

[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.260]
who's busy talking about high fly balls blow it in the wind. He won't

[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:53.020]
care. Yeah, how do you like that? Well, I'm telling you one thing I do

[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:57.040]
like because I'm asked one and I'll go and I'll go. Well, then you

[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.020]
want to be real happy. You know what do you sound like? You're such a

[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:02.140]
good mood. I want to thank you. We're going to have it on 24 hours at

[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:05.140]
APL. You're going to be just the pin in your pants. Okay, I have a

[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:08.700]
great day. He's happy. There's a happy camper. He's mashing it, man.

[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:13.840]
We have an open line in Broward to a second and third period on Friday

[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.340]
night in that coma game. And they were saying to me, tell me that

[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.660]
they were sitting down like toward the front and that there were a

[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:21.440]
bunch of people sitting behind him and a bunch of women especially. And

[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.960]
they were talking about everything but the game. And of course, I

[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.080]
realized it was a boring game. There wasn't much going on. It was

[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.920]
really bad game. But nevertheless, I thought to myself, is that

[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:32.780]
something new here? No, of course not. And excuse me for coming on here

[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.060]
and getting upset about something that nobody cares about. And

[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:37.380]
don't even know what the hell I'm talking about. Excuse me. I'm

[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:42.000]
very, very sorry. Aren't I? No. 5 6 7 O's line. We're going to get

[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.640]
all six of these lines live up right now in the next 30 seconds or

[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:52.680]
it's going to be two hours and 11 minutes for the joy. All right.

[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:58.400]
All right. I'm going to go. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.000]
Just like Aaron for yellow. That's an easy nation line. We don't

[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.940]
need those lyrics just to make a lot of noise. That's it. Come on.

[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.960]
So working in any lines. We're going so far. No, nobody calls.

[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:18.060]
5 6 7 0 5 60. We've got 400 open lines a day. 200 and proud. I

[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.940]
will not refrain until we get air. We've got damn line on the

[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:24.980]
board. Smoking here today. All of us are not aware. They're

[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:37.960]
in the bag again. They're in the sack. It's the Jolene show.

[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.260]
It's interesting. Remember I told you the day was

[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.700]
repeating my contract about that bonus thing and it says in

[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:49.820]
there that I'm required to produce and prepare a four hour

[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:53.000]
radio show. It is nothing about talk show. It's a radio show.

[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.520]
And that's our band. It's all right. Where's

[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:01.560]
through? Let's hear it. Come on. Please. Your hair. Oh,

[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.100]
here. What he did. Nice. Here. Do Billy.

[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:09.640]
No. Any progress here in the town of the walking dead. No.

[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:15.600]
Because they play with my self. I love you. Any job.

[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.480]
You can't be. Coming.

[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.020]
In Georgia.

[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:22.340]
In Gain.

[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.820]
Okay, we got one more line to line up there. It's in

[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:29.040]
Dade County. Are you following these numbers now? 5 6 7 0 5 60.

[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:34.640]
And Pomp 5 60 on the AT&T line. We pay for the mobile calls.

[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:37.420]
It's free. Okay. Any takers yet? No.

[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.060]
With clean.

[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:41.600]
Domen off.

[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.280]
He can't be.

[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.040]
Oh, right.

[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:47.100]
We love you. We're mine.

[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.300]
We really. One more. That's all we need. One more.

[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.620]
This is the episode we'll want to catch one of those little human

[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:55.180]
bricks out there. See if it's like a real living and breathing

[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:59.960]
first that I lie. I'm looking to get the wrong. He's thinking about it.

[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.580]
His talk is all the way down with me. It might be a car.

[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:05.720]
I think we had to do a break now, don't you?

[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:08.620]
Here's a mobile in for a lot of deal. Hello.

[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:10.580]
Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay, sir.

[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.940]
I just wanted to call. I was one of the guys that came up here.

[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:16.000]
The arena last week about the season.

[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:20.600]
And Sir, can I ask you this question? How come everybody can talk about the seats

[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.340]
are no good? No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, wait a minute. Let me finish the

[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:26.480]
question and the scoreboard sucks and the shot clock and everybody's an

[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.560]
expert on what they don't like. But when it comes to talking about the game

[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:34.060]
and the team, nobody has anything to say. I know. I was going on. This is the

[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:37.200]
sixth goddamn year now. And they still got nothing to say.

[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.480]
I want to talk about Whitney, but I just was going to say I tried to call in

[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.460]
the next day and I couldn't get through because you said nobody came up to

[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:46.180]
destroy you. It was got a minus three and no points or how about Garfun

[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:50.000]
Law, who's used us? How about all so many guys on there that you'd sit down

[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.420]
before a guy whose your number one player. I can't

[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.800]
I can't. I can't. I can't or like a glass there to the end of the game.

[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.820]
And that was the LA game. That's right. And it's the stay another extra half an hour.

[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.140]
Break that that was brutal. Nice go on, Kurt. But now I think it could be

[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:05.660]
Neater Meyer and Joe Van Attec rolled into one. I mean, aren't you startled by

[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:09.160]
the a little bit different approach and maybe a new something from all this

[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.600]
past experience and so highly touted. And he turns out to be the same

[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.260]
both. It was his brother. Well, I think maybe his brother's fallen his

[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.540]
strength could be a person of Auntie. Uh huh.

[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:21.000]
I just I couldn't believe when he's that Whitney and Thvella.

[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.280]
It took the most consistent guy.

[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:27.540]
Vaila by far the best defenseman on his team who's also a guy that can you know

[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:32.720]
One of our leading scorers can stick to fucking the net. Well, but look how much better they play they got a tie

[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.660]
Whoopee do me that's pretty exciting?

[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:38.240]
They need like last year we got a lot of little pies too. So we started losing every game

[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:42.720]
Yeah, and they don't show me anything this year and the two guys that they these are never losing

[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:44.600]
They're never knows where the puck is

[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:48.920]
You see the guys they make a nice pass. Don't he doesn't even see it? Yeah, I don't know what the hell he's thinking

[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.680]
We have an open line at Browler's line

[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.020]
We got the brain crushed back again

[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:58.120]
Maybe they're gonna make sure that we have a real long disgusting season is what they're gonna do the brain

[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:01.540]
Crushed is back. I told you see you can't make an idiot into a genius

[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:08.020]
You can't make a loser into a winner. You can't make somebody who likes screw this last year all of a sudden is gonna get bright this year

[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.640]
But hey nobody cares. So what shall I get excited about it?

[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:19.360]
Plus I can go there tomorrow and scream my brains out and I will I'm gonna be so goddamn loud. I might get kicked out of there tomorrow night

[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:23.080]
Here's a mobile in the four-letter day. Hello

[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:28.600]
Nail yes, sir in regards to your criticism of the oh, you know who that is don't you by the way

[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:31.080]
Chronic but he's there today. Thank you so much sir

[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:34.460]
five years for the dolphins right out of my own pocket and

[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:38.320]
Guess what I get free tickets to the offences here and give him away

[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.400]
How do you like that? I bet that breaks your heart. Don't answer

[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:46.820]
Okay, it's not a question of pain. It's a question to know what that you're going to see

[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:51.040]
That's the question anybody can get said fact that was that is that a compliment

[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:56.560]
And how about the 10,000 empty seats for the Rams game a week ago Sunday. How about those pal?

[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:03.720]
I'm starting to get a whole different idea and I salute the people that are gonna get their rape and pay to see crap

[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.440]
We have an open line offense because all they could talk about is college sports

[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:14.160]
Turn on the morning show and in between the couple of comments about Whitney and about Timur in between that all

[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:18.340]
They're talking about his gators again and the seminal of give me a frickin break

[01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:26.100]
And by the way my imitation of Dave Lamont last night if I say so myself on whammy was outstanding

[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:32.580]
That was great nice going Nail. Of course nobody could hear it

[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:39.120]
5 6 7 0 5 60 5 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.520]
That's right. I'm the bad guy blame me sir

[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:45.340]
Do your usual every day of your life to get out of your system just like a good

While the program is on

[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:04.060]
I

[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.640]
Like to play the heat

[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.480]
But unlike your

[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:14.140]
Don't expect to be seen by

[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:21.060]
I take the stage I am a rage or I like to sing and when I'm done

[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:24.680]
Those red dot baves want to be doing the world thing

[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:31.600]

I'll remember, we love you!

[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:08.160]
We love you, memory!

[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.740]
You're very fast!

[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:13.640]
You made this season!

[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.000]
We're all the right!

[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.180]
I'll be sure to guide you to Hollywood!

[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:17.680]
We'd rather die than talk to him!

[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.560]
I'd marry Ferry!

[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:23.640]
We'd rather die a nasty, miserable, horrendous, grotesque,

[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.340]
a master-pistag death, and speak to Andy Hollywood and Miss Ferry!

[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.940]
We love you, Menzie!

[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:31.420]
Oh yes we do!

[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.340]
The way you be, Ray Ford, and Rantford too!

[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:41.620]
And that sharp, and it goes, what's cool?

[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:47.040]
We'll make it, we love you!

[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:53.600]
For our penwork so easy to learn,

[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:57.720]
Because they play with my best heart!

[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.060]
We love you, Eddie Joe!

[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.400]
There can't be me!

[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:07.240]
And when you've scored in line, in game three,

[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:12.540]
The hall of renaissance, with Glee,

[01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:17.220]
Jorvanovsky, Kathy B.

[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.620]
I love you, Peter Mayne!

[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.340]
By the way, please, I call before screaming and hearing on.

[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.880]
I gave ten grand of the set of one campaign to give off the ground.

[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.140]
How much did you give, sir?

[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:30.120]
I'd rather get my money into a charity that can use the money

[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.420]
as a host of stuff up big in here,

[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:32.520]
But don't need it!

[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:34.160]
I'm gonna appreciate it!

[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.340]
I love you, Peter Mayne!

[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:39.160]
Sure we do!

[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.220]
Here's a mobile and homestead, hello!

[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:44.140]
Mobile and homestead!

[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:44.820]
Hello!

[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:45.540]
Yes, sir!

[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:48.100]
Yeah, I want to talk to the boss man!

[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:49.200]
You're talking to him?

[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.900]
Listen, I'm on my way back to Georgia from homestead!

[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:52.340]
Yeah?

[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.040]
I'll let him go to Newman!

[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:54.760]
Yeah?

[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:57.980]
We had one of the greatest high school football players I ever saw play there.

[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.300]
What Georgia Tech under Bill Lewis?

[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:06.080]
They'll try to play in about sixteen different positions to take advantage of his speed, his arm,

[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.360]
his whatever, his Derek Steegal.

[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.280]
And he got hurt three years at Tech.

[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.020]
It'll really blast him in there.

[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:15.080]
Sir, why are you telling me this? What does this mean?

[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:16.560]
Derek Steegal?

[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:20.860]
I had a walk away from what a free agent with a dog and a bus.

[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.600]
What a pisseder so easy to love!

[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:30.100]
I said wrong statement, but you made a bad mistake.

[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:32.680]
I love you, be good.

[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:35.380]
Oh, yes we do.

[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:37.940]
With your stock in hand.

[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:43.620]
Okay, 5.67, this is our last call otherwise it's Joel in from about ten after twelve till noon.

[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.440]
Till I mean till, till noon tomorrow.

[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:47.020]
What's wrong with that?

[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:47.880]
How can you say they are?

[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:51.700]
5.670560, pound 5.60 on a mobile one line.

[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:58.080]
I mean, how can this man, how can this man possibly be listening to this radio show and calling here

[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:03.360]
and start telling me about some five year old kid that played in Anefree, Georgia and got lost in the woods up there

[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.480]
while they were filming deliverance and had lunch with Bert Reynolds.

[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:08.140]
What is this man talking about?

[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.000]
I was expecting to say that corn sure is special.

[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:14.280]
Man, oh man alive.

[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.160]
What you mean talking about sir and by the way, Florida, get out of this state.

[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.360]
We got enough of your kind here already.

[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:18.960]
Get out of here.

[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.600]
5.6705, fine.

[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.640]
Let's go to steak and chicken, wait for them to open the doors.

[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:27.120]
Here's Miami Lake, hello.

[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:28.560]
Hey, Neo, how are you?

[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:29.120]
Okay, sir.

[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:38.080]
I was speaking to a friend of mine from Hollywood yesterday and he had mentioned something that he heard in your show regarding her.

[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.040]
So?

[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.580]
I just wanted to share that with you.

[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:43.020]
Well, what do you mean he mentioned it?

[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.200]
In other words, you haven't heard it?

[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:45.700]
No, I've never heard it.

[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.440]
Chronic, Chronic Holyo, you haven't heard it?

[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:50.720]
I'm not a Chronic Holyo, I'm the first time caller.

[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.180]
Yeah, sure, likely story.

[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:53.700]
Chronic.

[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:57.040]
So in other words, you're complaining about something you haven't even heard?

[01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:00.080]
Well, he told me about it.

[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.100]
He told you about it.

[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:01.820]
So what does that mean?

[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:05.680]
So you hear something segment and you're calling me power.

[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:06.380]
He's a what?

[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:08.180]
He's a whitey from power.

[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:09.320]
Meaning what?

[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.380]
That's, that's, he's a chronic.

[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.980]
He listens to you.

[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.040]
Yeah, and?

[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:17.180]
Well, he told me that was tasty.

[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:18.180]
Okay, blow it out your ass.

[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.400]
That's one of the Chronic Holyo's.

[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.020]
Get him out of here.

[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.020]
Taste this.

[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.960]
Open line and Broward, all of date five, six, seven, oh five, six, eight line.

[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.400]
It was tasteless.

[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.360]
How do you like that?

[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:33.600]
In fact, it was so tasteless we may have to play it again because this guy's just Jones in for it evidently.

[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:34.680]
Coming soon.

[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.880]
Obviously WQM, you're right, it was tasteless.

[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:39.160]
Okay, but will we play it again?

[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:39.560]
Uh-huh.

[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:40.460]
Over and over again?

[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:40.900]
Good.

[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:46.720]
In fact, we're going to alternate Joe Lin and that all between, uh, profit, seriously, between 1215 and two.

[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:50.600]
They were going to go back to back over and over again just because this guy's getting off he's squeezing it here in it.

[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.540]
Hey, Hollywood, Seminole Gaming has got to go.

[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.200]
You're trying to fight me.

[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.280]
What a, what a, you're one year.

[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:00.600]
Wow.

[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.060]
Take this one call. It's the last one we got.

[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.400]
Here's a mobile in Tamarack. Hello.

[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.940]
Hey Neil, how are you today?

[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:06.360]
Okay, sir.

[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:07.540]
Uh, two questions.

[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:08.960]
Well, one question in a statement.

[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:13.640]
The first one, you, I was a guy that called you to ask you about what kind of tranquilizes you were giving your little dog.

[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:14.540]
Yeah.

[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.980]
Did you ever check and see what the name of it was?

[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:18.740]
No, I did not because like I told you that.

[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:21.620]
Well, you're calling me back to ask what kind of tranquilizes I'm going to like.

[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:21.940]

[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:22.580]
No, I'm not.

[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:25.560]
Any veterinarian is going to give you tranquilizes for your little dog.

[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.660]
I'm not a veterinarian.

[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:27.440]
Okay.

[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:32.680]
And the second thing is, is I've been, I've been driving on the turnpike and I just want to report to you.

[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:34.900]
I've gone by three school buses.

[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:35.440]
Yeah.

[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:40.440]
Two black people, one black person and the fourth one was a gray-hound bus.

[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:43.020]
I couldn't tell who it was because the windows were so tinted.

[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:43.540]
All right.

[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:44.760]
Now you're getting a little warmer.

[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:45.560]
Thank you so much.

[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:46.960]
You're now he's getting on a bad wagon.

[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:47.640]
Let's hear it.

[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:47.900]
Oh!

[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:49.880]
Okay.

[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:50.320]
We're waiting.

[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:51.660]
I'll sit back in a chair and wait.

[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:51.980]
Okay.

[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.420]
In fact, let me, yeah, this is good.

[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:55.660]
Let me just pull this thing back.

[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:56.140]
Oh, geez.

[01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:57.820]
This thing don't work too good.

[01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.380]
Like everything else around here don't work too good.

[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.680]
This whole disc full of weed tins.

[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:01.560]
That's right.

[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:02.500]
We can play weed tunes.

[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:03.620]
In fact, let's take a poll.

[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:05.340]
What kind of music you want to hear between now and two?

[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.620]
This audience they don't want to talk today.

[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.140]
That's all right.

[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:10.400]
This has been Syndrome for the last few weeks down.

[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.280]
This whole radio station.

[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:12.500]
You know, they're not fooling me.

[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:14.960]
Every now and then they do like Thursday.

[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:15.660]
There'll be a lot of calls.

[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:16.180]
What's your beef?

[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.360]
They're giving away a bunch of crap.

[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.180]
And people make up all these crazy wild stories.

[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.560]
They try to win something for free.

[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:23.140]
And guess what, by the way, we're not giving away anything more on this show.

[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:24.960]
We try like it every weekend.

[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:26.300]
No free tickets.

[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.320]
No free CDs.

[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:28.520]
No free anything.

[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:29.440]
No free lunch.

[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:32.400]
We try to think it's a mammoth improvement, by the way.

[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:33.060]
I'm enjoying it.

[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:37.820]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the mobile.

[01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:38.140]
Right.

[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:38.940]
Likely story.

[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.900]
Open line in day one and brown.

[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:44.880]
Now, in 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:45.440]
Guess what?

[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.420]
It ain't going to get on the air.

[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:53.100]
This time, next time, 250 times from now, next circus, 70 years from Mishivos.

[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:54.500]
Ain't going to get on the air.

[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:55.260]
Okay.

[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.080]
So get a goddamn life.

[01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:00.360]
Find a goddamn good psychiatrist.

[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.360]
In fact, that's what we can use in this town is group therapy.

[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.280]
That's what we need.

[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.460]
Because if there's any place in the world that could take the joy out of living,

[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:09.660]
this is the place.

[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:12.460]
Here's Water Day Lakes.

[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:12.720]
Hello.

[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.460]
Hello, Uncle Neil.

[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:15.160]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.520]
Where is time, Carla?

[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:17.120]
All right.

[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:20.260]
I know you love sports a lot.

[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:21.720]
No, not really.

[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:24.280]
Okay, but you know a lot about it.

[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:28.640]
And I'd like to ask you your opinion, not a trivia question.

[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:29.120]
Uh-huh.

[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:34.600]
There are many, many baseball records and many, many different categories.

[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:37.180]
Okay, let's go to a mobile in cross-spring.

[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:37.500]
Hello.

[01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:38.560]
Okay, gone.

[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:40.740]
Here's Miami Lakes.

[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:41.120]
Hello.

[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:42.240]
Neil.

[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:42.840]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:49.180]
Between jet-boosh and the other alternative.

[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:52.880]
I don't know where it's staying with jet-boosh.

[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:53.980]
Yeah, okay.

[01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:54.560]
Well, let's go.

[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:55.300]
I'm happy for you.

[01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:57.520]
Two open lines a day to a brower.

[01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:59.080]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:00.100]
There's a guy that likes boys.

[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.200]
Okay, that's a big deal.

[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.960]
And the POM 560 on a mobile one line.

[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:06.640]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:07.200]
Hello.

[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:08.520]
Hello, Neil.

[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:09.080]
Yes, sir.

[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:15.820]
I'm not calling for any free tickets, but remember about four years ago you were visiting the Italy Alliance?

[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:16.320]
Yeah.

[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.960]
I heard the reason why, because what...

[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:26.560]
Okay, whatever you say, pal, you were four years ago I was visiting Italy and you heard the reason why I was, because I wanted to do it with the Pope.

[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:27.060]
That's right.

[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:27.760]
Okay, whatever you say.

[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.100]
Two open lines a day to a brower.

[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:32.700]
POM 560.

[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.140]
See, this is payback for Friday night.

[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:38.960]
I made the mistake of coming on here yesterday and saying, what a trip, what a relay.

[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:39.800]
It was interesting.

[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:42.680]
I'm sitting there in the arena Friday night in the Macarena during a horrible game.

[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:47.900]
I get this big old vision because they got my push up there and it actually made me feel good about being here for about two days.

[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.240]
And now I come in here this...

[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.700]
Today, we have about an hour and a half of a radio show.

[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:55.220]
I'm talking, they're talking like, what it's supposed to be all about.

[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.820]
And then all of a sudden it's like, hey, that's it, baby.

[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:00.620]
We're pulling the plug and now Erbie Coll is going to be an asshole.

[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:06.140]
And now we're going to keep as much of views on you as you'll take, which by the way the answer is none.

[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.280]
The big O.

[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:09.440]
That's it.

[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.220]
Let's heap a view on this son of a bitch.

[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:14.300]
Now because he was actually feeling pretty good about life there for a couple of days.

[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:18.040]
So now let's just bad mouth him and make him try to feel like about two inches tall.

[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:19.320]
I got two inches, okay?

[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:21.120]
And it works.

[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.720]
Here's a lady in Miami. Hello.

[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.400]
Lady in Miami.

[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:27.440]
Hi.

[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:28.320]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:34.220]
Yeah, I was just calling my boyfriend with telling me about this little clip you got on there with the Irishman.

[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:35.760]
I was wondering, could you play it?

[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:38.180]
No, ma'am. We're not doing all the requests Tuesday. Sorry, sweetheart.

[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:43.680]
Our tour call, we're asking for calls from people who have something to say about any goddamn thing in the world.

[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.600]
Anything to say about anything.

[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:47.220]
Anything.

[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.060]
How do you like that?

[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:55.360]
And she's calling me because your boyfriend said this and the other one, his boyfriend told him about the Chris Rea.

[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:55.900]
Was in a wheelchair.

[01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:02.280]
It is that in bad taste and Superman that is reacted like a capon and whatever it was, what a chicken crafting that was to say.

[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:06.220]
What a what a town.

[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:07.220]
What an audience.

[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:08.160]
What a bunch.

[01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:10.420]
Just unbelievable.

[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:12.860]
Open line in Dave County.

[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:13.600]
Come on. Let's go.

[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.580]
You can do it. Say something about anything.

[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:16.600]
Okay. About the world.

[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:18.660]
About the goddamn state of the universe.

[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.520]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:22.420]
5 6.

[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:27.320]
Now I do four out of five days here on this station scream and holler and carry on.

[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.560]
Does anybody care?

[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:29.560]
And the answer is no.

[01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:30.140]
Resounding.

[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:30.440]
No.

[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:34.240]
You won't make us give a crap no matter what it is, mister.

[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:34.860]
Okay.

[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.360]
Here's for Lauderdale.

[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:37.640]
Hello.

[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:38.220]
Neil.

[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:38.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:40.420]
Where did you get back on the air?

[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:41.700]
I just moved back from Los Angeles.

[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:44.260]
I hear your voice flipping through the air and looking for sports.

[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.020]
Likely stirring.

[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:45.760]
Huh?

[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:46.780]
I don't believe it.

[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:47.880]
Where did you get back on the air?

[01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:48.820]
10 months ago, sir.

[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:49.680]
Jesus.

[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.620]
Because I was out there for about a year and a half.

[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:52.900]
I got nobody decent out there.

[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:53.240]
Yeah.

[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.840]
I got a million of one rock and roll stages.

[01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:55.540]
I come back here.

[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.140]
We got one left and we had one left.

[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:57.600]
Yeah.

[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:58.000]
What?

[01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.600]
So you're on back on the air?

[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:00.440]
What's it giving you now?

[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:01.380]
Meaning what?

[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:02.060]
What would it be?

[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:02.720]

[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:04.020]
What?

[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:05.000]
Is it any of my business?

[01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:05.680]
What they're paying you?

[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:07.100]
Of course it's not anybody's business.

[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:08.480]
I'm going to talk about how much I'm making.

[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:10.500]
So there's no arena that works going to?

[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:10.960]
No.

[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:11.500]
No.

[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:12.400]
No, I'd stay home.

[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:13.080]
Get out of here.

[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.060]
Go back where you came from.

[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.120]
Two open lines in Broward.

[01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:16.620]
Five in me.

[01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:17.380]
Do you believe this guy?

[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:18.280]
Does anybody believe that?

[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:18.540]
No.

[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:19.080]
Of course not.

[01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:21.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.160]
Pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.020]
Evidently, weren't paying him enough on a West Coast because he came back here.

[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:28.860]
Anybody in their right mind go to the West Coast to come back here?

[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:29.160]
No.

[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:30.020]
Give me a break.

[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.960]
Here's a mobile and crawl spring.

[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:32.320]
Hello?

[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:34.480]
Yeah.

[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.180]
Mobile and crawl springs, yes, sir.

[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:40.580]
Yeah, I'm going to see them take it hold for the team's right?

[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:40.920]
Yes.

[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.940]
I got phone call from the Marlins today.

[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:44.980]
They want me to renew.

[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:45.700]
Yeah.

[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:52.600]
I gave up the tickets last year and they told me I wouldn't lose my priority seating or anything.

[01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:54.360]
So I asked them if the team had been sold.

[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:54.800]

[01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:56.240]
Yeah.

[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:56.960]
Anyway.

[01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:57.800]
And?

[01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:00.600]
And, yeah, I'm just fed up with them.

[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:02.200]
You know, I'm waiting for the deal to go through.

[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:05.580]
Why would you, well, what do you mean you're waiting for the sale to go through and then what's going to happen?

[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.720]
I'm willing to give Henry a chance.

[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:13.380]
I'll convey to the Salt says, high single will continue to run the Marlins before owners approve the sale.

[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.880]
Although, although, although sir, can I finish?

[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:22.180]
Although Henry wanted to consider lowering ticket prices, the team's front office is not consulted on the issue.

[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:26.840]
They'll instead follow directives of high Zenga and Rick Rochon, which means they're not lowering the ticket prices.

[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.400]
And we ain't still going to have his finger in it for who knows how long.

[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.480]
Okay, real quick on the arena.

[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:33.000]
Yeah.

[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.740]
And what about the team, sir?

[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:40.460]
I just, I just thought it was not going to be the home is the most disappointing thing you could imagine.

[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:41.780]
Okay, thank you.

[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:43.480]
Okay, we have an open line in Broward.

[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:47.200]
Five six, five six, seven, oh five, 60.

[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:49.680]
Pound five, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:52.200]
I can't possibly be here.

[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.580]
I'm going to pinch myself.

[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:54.960]
I'm going to pinch myself so hard.

[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:56.140]
No, seriously, then I'm going to bleed.

[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:57.180]
I'm going to pop a gun.

[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:58.040]
I'm going to pop a gasket.

[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:01.160]
Pop has got a brand new gasket, a Tisca the Tasket.

[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:02.040]
Let's see your basket.

[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:04.680]
I mean, I'm just going to pinch it so hard and they are skinned to.

[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:12.840]
I mean, how is it possible that there are so many people, 18,000 people together in one building?

[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.460]
Are they seeing anything?

[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:14.760]
No.

[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:16.100]
Are they perceiving anything?

[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:16.280]
No.

[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.060]
Are they just by osmosis?

[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.680]
Is anything rubbing off on them?

[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:19.920]
No.

[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.640]
Besides the smoke from out in the hallway.

[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:30.200]
Boy, this is a scary, scary, fucking place.

[01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:32.260]
I almost said it.

[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:33.740]
Here's Pemberpine.

[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:34.040]
Hello.

[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:36.060]
Oh, boy.

[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:36.680]
Yes?

[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:37.460]
Neil.

[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:37.960]
Yes.

[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.860]
First time caller, long time listener.

[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:40.260]
Okay.

[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:44.760]
But I got a, I got a Ricky one this morning, buddy.

[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:45.500]
Yeah.

[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:47.640]
What's with the spot on, um...

[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:48.440]
Okay.

[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:51.100]
Open line in, uh, day five, six, nothing to say.

[01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:52.860]
But I got a Ricky one this morning.

[01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:54.860]
Well, thought I'd just save it, okay, pal?

[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.000]
Save the energy.

[01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:58.980]
See, that's one thing that they'll do.

[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.480]
They'll make all the energy in the world if they can take a cheap shot.

[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:02.860]
If I can rip you one, okay?

[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:03.420]
Rip this.

[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:04.600]
Thank you.

[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:06.500]
Oh, God.

[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.840]
Here's the North Miami Beach.

[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:09.140]
Hello.

[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:11.180]
North Miami Beach.

[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.180]
Hi, Neil.

[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:12.820]
Yes, sir.

[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:15.680]
Last week I was in the Lincoln Road Mall.

[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:16.220]
Yes.

[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:19.200]
Suddenly I hear some, uh, Harry Krishna music.

[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:19.760]
Yeah.

[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.400]
Drums and bells and all that stuff.

[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:21.740]
Yeah.

[01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:24.600]
Suddenly I pulled the smiling guy with orange.

[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:29.100]
Just start giving away, whammy business card.

[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.700]
The whammy TV business card.

[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:31.220]
Yeah.

[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:33.800]
Is that a new marketing plan of...

[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.140]
No, no, that was probably, uh, Maddie looking for a job.

[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:37.540]
Yeah.

[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.300]
Yeah, the job, but that was funny.

[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:42.300]
That the Krishna guy stopped giving away whammy, uh...

[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:43.520]
No, no, the bald headed geek.

[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:44.180]
That's Maddie.

[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:44.960]
That's some Maddie lesson.

[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.920]
That's why he's giving out his...

[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:48.620]
Sure, absolutely.

[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.000]
That's why he's giving out his business card.

[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:52.420]
Not a Harry Krishna, he's just a bald headed geek.

[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:54.760]
Believe it or not.

[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:55.660]
Okay, pal, good luck to you.

[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:57.020]
Don't, uh, don't harm whatever you do.

[01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.380]
Unless you wanted his really spy.

[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.020]
We have an open list when Nenyaah, who is up there with, uh, Yasser Arafart,

[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.820]
and all those other goyem.

[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:08.860]
And, you know, even he made a cross to comment about Maddie lesson.

[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:09.440]
I couldn't believe it.

[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:10.200]
Right there in the White House.

[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:11.420]
Got a sitting ovation.

[01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:14.940]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sis, warningly.

[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.600]
Okay, go right ahead.

[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:17.660]
Be my guest.

[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.140]
Rip me a big fat...

[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:19.520]
Reckham.

[01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:21.400]
And it'll make you feel better.

[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:24.640]
Oh, yeah, see this, this, they made a bad mistake Friday.

[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:25.900]
They won't ever do that again.

[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:28.020]
They won't ever be doing that again.

[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.840]
Making this man feel like almost like somebody might like him out there.

[01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:32.900]
Like somebody listens because we enjoy the show.

[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.460]
Not because we're a bunch of massacres, then we hate him like poison.

[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.880]
Which is what we usually like to keep the relationship on at level.

[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:43.040]
I should have known that something was up.

[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:45.880]
Crawl 25 at five eight eight eight.

[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:48.280]
Anybody have a heart or a liver?

[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:51.040]
Oh my god, Becky, look at his head.

[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:52.680]
It's like so big.

[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:55.040]
It looks like one of those alien guys has...

[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:56.800]
It's just so round.

[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.960]
My name is Robert and I like to dance.

[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:01.320]
I got a big hip and I wear short pants.

[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.560]
I got a mohawk and a ring through my nose.

[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:06.800]
I shopped in the kid section for my clothes because I'm a hip hop.

[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:07.540]
Legit.

[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:08.700]
Hip hop.

[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:09.580]
Legit.

[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:11.240]
Hip hop.

[01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:11.940]
Legit.

[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.020]
Hip hop.

[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:14.120]
Legit.

[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.000]
Hip hop.

[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:19.820]
Legit.

[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:20.760]
Hip hop.

[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:20.880]
Legit.

[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:21.340]
Hip hop.

[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:22.120]
Legit.

[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:22.120]

[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:22.120]

[01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:24.100]
You're sure?

[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.740]
12 30 at five sixty WQM are sent to one total.

[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:28.140]
By the way, we have a revised total.

[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:29.640]
All the estations reporting in now.

[01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:32.560]
45,877 bucks.

[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:33.780]
That's as of 10 o'clock this morning.

[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:34.220]
Not bad.

[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:36.240]
Not great, but not bad.

[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.380]
For our first month, we got the November December to go.

[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.840]
And you go to your borders and pick up the best of the meal.

[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:43.900]
All the items one and two CD or cassette or both and they're great.

[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:48.320]
And you can also get your best in the L T shirt and the CDs and cassettes when we do our

[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.620]
appearance at the Ben and Jerry's in the Avenger Amal.

[01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:54.860]
This Saturday noon to two Ben and Jerry's being right near the Rainforest Cafe between the

[01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:57.480]
AMC theaters and blooming nails on the south side of the mall.

[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:57.960]
You got it?

[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:58.120]
No.

[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.060]
We'll draw you a diaphragm.

[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:01.960]
That's not bad about 46 ran, huh?

[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:03.120]
And we still have a week to go?

[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:04.880]
What?

[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:08.220]
Sorry, I just got an eyelash from my eye.

[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:08.580]
I'm distracted.

[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:11.900]
So in other words, you can't talk and pick your eyelash out of your eye at the same time.

[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:12.760]
You're like Greg Rees.

[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.560]
I think we should be doing better than that.

[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:15.320]
I would agree.

[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:19.500]
Considering 10 grand of that is mine and a couple of grand is money that my friend Ron from Philadelphia

[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.680]
gave 15 out of a box at the hockey game and another $50 check.

[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:27.820]
Of course, what's the big donation start pouring in from our friends here at QA&M?

[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:29.320]
Then we're going to go away over the top, right?

[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.420]
No, a little delayed reaction in the other room.

[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:34.860]
Here's a lady mobile in Boca.

[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:35.160]
Hello?

[01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:37.620]
Hi.

[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:37.900]
Hi.

[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:38.760]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.840]
I'm calling from Boca Raton at a mobile phone.

[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:42.520]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.260]
I've been listening to you for years.

[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:45.120]
Well, here I am.

[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:48.960]
And it's lunchtime and I'm formally from Rochester, New York.

[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:49.640]
All right.

[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.000]
I would love a little dawn's wide go-hot and french fries.

[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:54.720]
Uh-huh.

[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:55.960]
I can't find it in Boca.

[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:56.720]
Not in Boca.

[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.280]
You've got to drive all the way down to Miami.

[01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:01.220]
You've got to drive all the way down to Wayne Arnold's in Miami.

[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:03.500]
That'd be wonderful.

[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.340]
We have to go to see Breeze.

[01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:05.800]
Uh-huh.

[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:10.200]
I love what you talk about, Mr. in all that area.

[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.460]
It's a great place to be from and talk about.

[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:13.200]
Yeah.

[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:14.220]
It's about.

[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:15.960]
Okay, get in the phone.

[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:16.580]
Get in the phone.

[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:17.000]
Thank you.

[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:18.160]
Well, she's from Rochester.

[01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:21.740]
They don't have good cell phones in Rochester because they get, you know, the lilacs

[01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:22.540]
interfere with the reception.

[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:29.080]
We have an open line and date one and Broward, 5667, 0560, 0560 on a mobile one line.

[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:30.440]
Let's talk about Rochester.

[01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:31.900]
Want to talk about Don and Bob?

[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:32.120]
No.

[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:32.900]
About C.B.

[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:33.180]
No.

[01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:34.200]
About Cobbs Hill.

[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:34.360]
No.

[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:35.920]
About Silver Stadium in the Red Wings.

[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:36.120]
No.

[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:37.380]
About the Rochester Amherst.

[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:37.960]
Oh, sorry.

[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:38.660]
That's talking about.

[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:38.660]

[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:39.460]
Oh, no.

[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:41.220]
Come on.

[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.500]
Let's talk about Depeux.

[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:46.460]
Let's talk about Dunkirk and Batavia and Leroy and Cheek to Waga.

[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:47.240]
Now you're talking.

[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:47.960]
Now you're getting warm.

[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:51.340]
Let's talk about Niagara Falls on the east side and on the west side.

[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:54.100]
Let's talk about St. Catharines Ontario and Hamilton.

[01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:54.360]
Hey.

[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:57.900]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:58.280]
Hello.

[01:29:59.220 --> 01:29:59.820]
Hello, Neil.

[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:00.360]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:04.680]
Neil, I am a first time caller and I've been listening to you recently.

[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:05.280]

[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:06.420]
You've got it listening to you recently.

[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:07.700]
You've got a great show.

[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:10.100]
George is also a great site kick you have there.

[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:14.140]
As far as all this politics goes, I just like to say everybody promises.

[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:16.240]
Nobody delivers votes for nobody.

[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:16.920]
Yeah.

[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.320]
And I just want to tell you you've got a great show and I love your spoofs.

[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:20.800]
Okay.

[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:21.560]
Thank you.

[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:22.160]
Have a great day.

[01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:23.460]
I'll see you in Niagara Falls, pal.

[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:23.980]
Right in there.

[01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:25.120]
I'll be the one in the barrel.

[01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:26.980]
Two overlines a day.

[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:28.240]
Here they're on that goddamn phone.

[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:28.960]
You got stuck here.

[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.560]
Which had today they've been bap bap bap bap.

[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.780]
Who are all those goddamn people?

[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:32.380]
That was self-help.

[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:33.820]
What the hell does he want?

[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:34.940]
Who wants to know what he can do to help?

[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.520]
I think he can do to help one.

[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:37.540]
Bring us a lot of water.

[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:38.100]
So what do you want?

[01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:38.600]
How to check?

[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:39.300]
Yeah.

[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:40.320]
Bring us a check.

[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:40.700]
Okay.

[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:41.280]
Very simple.

[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:44.460]
50 bucks, 100 bucks, 500 bucks, 1000 bucks.

[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:47.540]
Center one, two words, C-E-N-T-E-R.

[01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:49.940]
Don't spell the Canadian like C-E-N-T-R-E.

[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:51.080]
We don't like that crap.

[01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:51.900]
But we'll take it anyway.

[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:54.000]
Center one, two words.

[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:54.500]
That's all.

[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:57.580]
And see these CDs are so goddamn.

[01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:58.540]
See this, Polone?

[01:30:58.540 --> 01:30:59.400]
This business is bad.

[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:00.240]
You know, it's a fag.

[01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:01.480]
It's gone up to two with fags.

[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:04.200]
And these idiots out there thinking because they help people with AIDS.

[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:04.940]
It's a fag charity.

[01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:08.280]
Whether it's going to Camilo's house, center one, into my pocket.

[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:09.020]
Where would it help us go?

[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.020]
What no difference would it make?

[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:13.940]
Because we got the same stuff out that we've had in every goddamn year.

[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:16.280]
The only problem is we're trying to do it here in a vacuum.

[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:19.840]
And so what's 10 times as hard as it was on WIOD,

[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:21.100]
which even though we hated like poison,

[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:23.640]
nevertheless there was some continuity on that radio station.

[01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:26.320]
Because there was more than one of us doing the same goddamn thing.

[01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:29.540]
As opposed to here where we get our good friend,

[01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:32.120]
whenever I wrote it down with a Susan, that's right, Susan.

[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.380]
You're losing Susan.

[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:34.900]
Caused in this morning.

[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:36.100]
Oh, I wouldn't listen to Hank.

[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:37.800]
And I sure wouldn't listen to a What's His Name.

[01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:39.140]
I'm so evil.

[01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:40.420]
I'm so vulgar.

[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:41.500]
I'm so disgusting.

[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:43.580]
They don't even want to mention my name.

[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.140]
The callers on the sports shows.

[01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:49.440]
It's like the unspoken one, the unspeakable one.

[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:51.560]
What's his name?

[01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:52.500]
I wouldn't listen to him.

[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:54.660]
But of course, he heard the rumors about the morning show

[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:55.660]
because she was so stupid.

[01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:57.040]
She believed the crap about Reneerie.

[01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:58.960]
She bought the, and where did she hear it?

[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.360]
Did she hear it on Hank show?

[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:00.700]
No.

[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:02.040]
Did she hear it on Eddie Kaplan show?

[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:02.360]
No.

[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:03.460]
Did she hear it on the dolphin game?

[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:03.640]
No.

[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:05.920]
She heard it on this goddamn show, right Susan?

[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:09.780]
You lying phony bitch, who's listening right now,

[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.240]
but doesn't know my name.

[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:14.820]
Wouldn't know Nia Rogers if I stepped out her out like a goddamn cockroach.

[01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:18.860]
And I might, because it's the,

[01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:21.260]
the fashionable thing to do on this radio station,

[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.360]
because this is the Jockstrap station.

[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:26.280]
This is the Faggot station, like Al Goldstein says.

[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.440]
We're all the guys hang around and take showers together.

[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:29.000]
That's right.

[01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:30.600]
The Faggot station.

[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:33.600]
Here's for it, Myers.

[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:33.900]
Hello?

[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:38.140]
Uh, to New and Neil, I mean, deal with, go more stuff.

[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:38.660]
Okay.

[01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:41.220]
Speaking of English, you're on a wrong coast for that.

[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:41.720]
Okay.

[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.420]
I thought I was one of those despicable Colombians for a second.

[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:45.240]
Just a second.

[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.180]
Yesterday, the book you were reading,

[01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:49.220]
I'd like to get a copy of that.

[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:51.480]
I can't stand sports, and it sounded pretty good.

[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:52.940]
Could you just repeat the sentence?

[01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:54.380]
It was called pros and cons.

[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:55.920]
The criminals who play in the NFL.

[01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:57.020]
You might find interesting.

[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:58.140]
It goes along with that.

[01:32:58.340 --> 01:32:58.400]
Yeah.

[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.380]
Two high school football stars here.

[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.040]
I got in a fight.

[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:03.740]
And one of them shot the other.

[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.520]
The white guy was shot by a black guy.

[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:09.200]
And they had a trial.

[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:12.980]
And actually, there was two black guys that crashed this white party.

[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:15.080]
And white people threatened the black people.

[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:15.400]
Yeah.

[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:16.120]
Anyway, the white people.

[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:17.360]
That's all I was shot there, right?

[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:18.540]
In the thigh.

[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:21.500]
The black star was a quiddit,

[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:22.720]
even though he had a gun with.

[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.460]
He meant admitted that discharging had gone in the city limits.

[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:27.980]
And so he's acquitted.

[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.440]
Now he's back on the football team,

[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:31.560]
and everybody's happy because he's going to be playing this game.

[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:31.820]
Right.

[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:32.520]
There you go.

[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:35.100]
Take all three of them and throw them in the colors of Hatchy River.

[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:36.260]
That's the reason.

[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:37.000]
I can't believe that.

[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:37.820]
Yeah.

[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:38.340]
I'm sorry.

[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:38.780]
Go ahead.

[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:44.640]
I just can't believe after my comments about the despicable Colombian people.

[01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:48.880]
And not one of them called in to defend their miserable race down there.

[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:49.680]
It's really incredible.

[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:50.600]
That's good.

[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:51.620]
That's a good topic for us.

[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.780]
So we're going to invite all the Colombians to call in today.

[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:54.180]
Excellent.

[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:56.220]
I understand that George works something up on that.

[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:59.340]
And it would really be below me to provide to hear that.

[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:00.140]
So I'm not going to do it.

[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:01.220]
But thank you, Meteor.

[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:01.600]
Okay.

[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:02.200]
And back to you.

[01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:02.540]
Okay.

[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:03.020]
Okay.

[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:04.440]
There's the guy who hates Colombians.

[01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.340]
There's a post to me who loves Colombians.

[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.380]
We have two open lines in date.

[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.660]
5-steen, 05-60 on the mobile one line.

[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.660]
22-to-1 in brews at twos.

[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:14.260]
Let me take a few.

[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:17.820]
Okay.

[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:43.340]
We got the boogers.

[01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:44.940]
Why do I waste my time?

[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:46.940]
Why do I waste my time?

[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.660]
One of the great books that you must read.

[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:51.600]
You should have it in your hand right now, Goddamnit, in the book too.

[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:53.360]
Every single one of you.

[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.620]
Have we had one report on that book today?

[01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:57.080]
No.

[01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.760]
Lost rights to destruction of American liberty.

[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:01.520]
Paperback for crying out loud.

[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.100]
James Bovard, VOV, and Chewredio.

[01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:04.920]
That's what they're doing today.

[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:05.660]
That's what they're not calling it.

[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:06.140]
I'll read in the book.

[01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:06.580]
Thank you.

[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:09.480]
Now I feel better.

[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:10.460]
They're reading the Goddamn book.

[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:11.100]
Just dummy up.
