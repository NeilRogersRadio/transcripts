[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420]
Sport Radio 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.860]
A lot!

[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.480]
The company Neil called 567 0560 toll free for date and rarer

[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.860]
from home 560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.180]
Yeah.

[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.440]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not necessarily

[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.380]
reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisitions for the Beasley Broadcast Group.

[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.440]
Now, Neil Rogers on Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.960]
Great Whitney has prepared!

[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:47.420]
You left out the Giggle.

[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:56.740]
When he makes an wiggle, Monica is not the kind you can do in the behind.

[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.220]
Welcome.

[00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.600]
But a cigar and her vagina she's all mine.

[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.520]
All right.

[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.940]
Well, he don't know where a stoke goes.

[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.100]
I can see how there was some confusion between humor, door and human horror.

[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.200]
And then, again, saw the term Cedar Box mean saw her naked.

[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.960]
Stars report can lead to going blind.

[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:38.980]
Now, listen, he was working hard late nights in the overrear of this working on the practical

[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:39.900]
joke.

[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:51.440]
He took a mac and noodle, put an explode in, load in for Monica was blowing rings

[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.440]
a smoke.

[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.780]
Bills the cars and Monica's a vagina.

[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.400]
Oh, great.

[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.220]
Yeah.

[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.160]
Yeah.

[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.860]
Every time he makes an wiggle, Monica is not the kind you can do in the behind.

[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.840]
Cause when a car and her vagina she's all mine.

[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.660]
Or people feel about Hillary's been made a fool of fire husband.

[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.840]
Feel that Hillary was wronged.

[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.300]
Up in the Lincoln bedroom she was born in morning.

[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.980]
Morning, I'll draw a few in her with Bill's old bomb.

[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.880]
Oh, right.

[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.740]
Bills the cars and Monica's a vagina.

[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.860]
Okay.

[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.880]
She let's out of Giggle.

[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.340]
Every brick and sally makes a wiggle.

[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.820]
Monica is not the kind you can do in the behind.

[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.740]
But us, a car and her vagina she's all mine.

[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.760]
Yeah.

[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.520]
More candy than this.

[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.740]
Yeah, that's not the risaster.

[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.060]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.800]
What you got to do is take a sip of real love.

[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.840]
And put it in a brown.

[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.940]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.320]

[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.600]
More now.

[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.820]
I was a car and her vagina.

[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.600]
Whoa, yeah.

[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.960]

[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.080]
Where the hell do we start today, man?

[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.720]
I guess right at the beginning, 10.030 at 5.60 W.200.

[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.720]

[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.720]

I know.

[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.680]
I know.

[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.920]

[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.000]

[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.000]

[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.000]

[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.140]
I know.

[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.140]

[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.140]

[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.540]
I know.

[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.640]
I know.

[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.640]

[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.800]
I know.

I know.

[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.300]
I know.

[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.400]
Okay.

[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.800]
Now this takes me back to my days at KAT many, many years ago.

[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.700]
And I had already left there, but I heard this story.

[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.880]
Howard Premer, who replaced the late Joe Freed as news director,

[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.380]
was called the, you call a catch in time, the owner of the station.

[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.300]
We're sitting in the orifice, and she called him to have a meeting with her.

[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.920]
And she called him to have a meeting with her, unbeknownst to Howard at the time.

[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.520]
He was about to get the acts.

[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.040]
He was about to get fired.

[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.340]
He was about to get fired.

[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.360]
He was about to get fired.

[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.320]
He was about to get fired.

[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.280]
He was about to get fired.

[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.080]
Well, why Howard was sitting in the waiting area out in the lobby,

[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.040]
waiting to a meet with you.

[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.420]
He was about to get fired.

[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.060]
The program director, they had just brought in from Washington DC from WKAT.

[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.280]
This guy had been here for about a week or whatever.

[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.080]
And that's the truth.

[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.140]
They've been there for almost a week, and that was enough for him.

[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.620]
Even back then, this is in about 1978, 1979.

[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.000]
That was enough for him.

[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.580]
He said a week in his place, this outdoor funeral parlour.

[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.980]
That's it.

[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.440]
So he goes into you, cola.

[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.160]
And quit.

[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.220]
I can't take it here.

[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.160]
I can't live here. This place is a nightmare. This is not going to work out. I quit

[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.000]
So now she's like what do I do now? So Howard Primer happens to be the closest body

[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.300]
He's sitting in a chair out there right outside her office. Oh come on in Howard. How would you like to be the program director?

[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.140]
And Howard said okay, okay

[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:20.900]
And eventually not too much later down the road Howard's father-in-law, I believe it was who had lots and lots of money bought the station and

[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.160]
They turned it in location melodies or whatever the hell it evidently became and they sold it

[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.500]
I do believe in they'd lots and lots and lots and lots of money with it

[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.320]
Now why do I take you that story because it's very similar to the Rick and Sud story

[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:44.700]
Which is just unbelievable now I have a feeling Rick might not face up on the ear of this no no now when do they officially start in the morning by the way

[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.660]
January 4th for this long vacation and by the way they did play that turkey's on parade

[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.640]
Oh, man

[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.980]
Did they be from oh for the four billion time in the morning see people's your I want to tell you something

[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.580]
There are people in this business. I've been in the business for about 700 years

[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.560]
There are people that are good people. There are people that are like they're okay. They're not so good

[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.720]
They're not so bad. They're kind of like you know neither efficient or foul and then there are people who are real assholes

[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:17.520]
I'm gonna tell you people your you are whatever whatever the level of the assholes is you're so far beneath them

[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.740]
You're like the dingle berries on the record the lowest asshole on the food chain. That's what you are

[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.620]
So let me do a break here because we need to do a little business today

[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:33.840]
Which is I don't understand it how come yesterday we had like no business lots right Joe didn't want to much pressure yesterday

[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.120]
Eight minutes after ten I'll send it to Rick and Sud story and the real you're not gonna believe this

[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.520]
It is just so typical of this business and Pete Bolger the assassin

[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:51.740]
From here on in Peter Bolger will be referred to as the assassin in the radio business in this market from this day forward

[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.100]
And I'm sure won't be a first

[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.640]
Hey, the year-end scores are when I come and tell you for the last year

[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.380]
This this overhead by the way sucks today. We got a cranked down or they potch getting around with levels in here really

[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:08.660]
Close big time very sure it shows fault. No, it's not Joe's fault. Joe did a super superior job yesterday

[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.120]
By the way a dangling job not that you mentioned it

[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.900]
No, you ignorant slide

[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.460]
Riley stole my

[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.740]
I like the park in his face

[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:30.860]
That's for me Jake what gives him the right. Oh, I think his wife want to fight it off tonight

[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.440]
Rick Riley stole my

[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.620]
Distraint through the human race

[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.960]
You're a smock

[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.200]
And go bird sucks

[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:48.320]
That wheel of meat should also include Rick Riley's but oh oh oh oh

[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.780]
Riley stole my

[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.420]
I like a part in his face

[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.420]
This is Rick Wally you're an asshole

[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.280]
Yeah

[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:12.520]
Go

[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.360]
That was for real. I wonder whatever made him laugh like that. I looked up Hainey. Okay

[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.600]
Anyway, it's 1013 at 560 WDQM

[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.440]
So here's the real story behind the story on Rick and Studs over Super Talk Network

[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:30.120]
So evidently their contract was coming up by in January or February of this coming year in just a month or two and

[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.940]
Peter Bolger called Rick Wally in one day and said

[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.720]
Guess what you think you're gonna be here. Well, no, you're not

[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.760]
You're out. We're not gonna renew your contract. We have no interest. You better start looking around

[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:46.340]
And yes, we will let you come in and have one last show and say goodbye and blow it off your ass and whatever and that's it

[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.220]
And Rick said no

[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:50.720]
No

[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.380]
Well, I guess he went and off in the corner and talked for a little while and thought about it

[00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:00.560]
Thought about actually going out and finding another job since I'm sure there's tremendous demand to them all over the country

[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:07.580]
And he finally came back another meeting with people during the came in practically weeping was it practically or was it that well whatever was

[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:15.160]
Weeping and said but you know, you don't have anything see what they were gonna do is they were gonna have another syndicate

[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.620]
These are the great programmers the people at queer channel who never met a chief deal that they didn't like

[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:26.820]
Who took W.I.O.D. and destroyed it now they're taking W.I.N.Z without the caller

[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.360]
It isn't so nobody knows what they are anymore stupid talk and destroying that too

[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.920]
Not that it's bad enough that they put that babbling idiot back on me after them

[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.060]
He's abroad. Yeah, right, Pich. He's abroad. She ought to be abroad like over in Singapore somewhere

[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.040]
I'd have to keep that cane her to death

[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:50.320]
But at any rate no seriously if you laugh like that and think before they came you for like about 20 consecutive hours until you stop the crap

[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:58.260]
But it ain't right so to make a long story short rick goes through a long careful song in an answer with the people

[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:03.600]
You're in well, you know, you don't have a morning show and people just says oh

[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.860]
Well, now that you mention it. Oh, yeah, and also here's the latest bullet in Mike churches fired over

[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.000]
And Tom Lycus is in super talk radio, which is allegedly

[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.720]
Stopped and now only has two local shows Rick and Todd's and Brooke

[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.520]
There you go two local shows. How do you like that?

[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.040]
And they got time don't like us on there. Oh my god

[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.900]
Talk about Desperados

[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.400]
Two local shows they've eliminated all the other local people on the year

[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.320]
So a queer channel once again doing what their famous home industry

[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.420]
We don't want to spend any money all we care about is have an 80 million patients in every market

[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.860]
And you know squeezing as much revenue as we can out of them and the screw the audience and that's what they've done

[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.840]
So at any rate a rick wildly cheerfully paid for the job back and the people just says okay

[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.360]
They're very much reduced you have to take a big cut and pay

[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.240]
And rick rightly said okay, and that was that

[00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:00.680]
And that's the real story of how Rick and Todd's wound up back in the mornings on super talk

[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.760]
Instead of getting cad instead of not the being on there anymore instead of being on on the street on the beach

[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.320]
They are gonna be back in the morning January 4

[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:15.260]
Don't let anybody tell you otherwise because that is the ms that's right from the horses back. Don't you know mistake about it

[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.900]
So people are like I said the assassin

[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.760]
Continues destroying everything in his wake like a radio godzilla

[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:30.940]
No seriously and have you ever noticed the similarity? I think he looks a little like he looks like a cross between godzilla

[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.520]
And what's that god damn right wing congressman the balding guy from Florida that I can never think of his name with the glasses

[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:41.800]
The bdi bastard the one that's always forming at the mouth. Oh, I'm peach man. I'm peach man. Whatever's name is I can't think of his name

[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.620]
But he's he's like a cross between godzilla and that asshole. That's Pete Bolger

[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.580]
How do you sleep at night Pete you're such a chronic compulsive liar

[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:56.420]
I've never I've known so much. I mean lies in this business. We got plenty of liars in this building believe me

[00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.040]
Wait till the guys over there. I'm charred in street find out about the new equipment

[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.400]
To be in the new studios upstairs. Oh, yeah. Oh, I shouldn't have said that

[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.440]
I don't want to burst your bubble, but

[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.880]
New equipment. Yeah, basically what they're doing is they're picking them up out of the toilet

[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.180]
And they're just taking all the same old crap and swinging it upstairs here

[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:19.200]
power 96 they got beautiful brand new state of the art equipment and is the qm crowd gonna get that no

[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:26.480]
No, are they gonna get the shaft? No, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a wrong finger on the way. Yeah

[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.220]
They're gonna get it. They're gonna take the same old worn out tired beastly garbage and just took it upstairs

[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.360]
So they'll have new paint on the wall like George said and they'll be in a different facility which you know

[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.420]
And if my friend the exterminator who came in yesterday off the street shows up once in a while

[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.760]
Maybe we won't have the bugs in the ants in the roaches now you think you think he'll show up again. No

[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:53.120]
What does that tell you about this business when you have to go on the year and belly ache about bugs and ants and you have to get an

[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.300]
exterminator who out of the kindness of his heart comes in and the spritzes around a little bit. He was squirting and

[00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:58.600]
He's squirting

[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:04.620]
Just because he felt sorry for us that this company is so god damn cheap. They won't hire an exterminator

[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:12.140]
And of course this being a non-union town to begin with you mean you have to put up with whatever kind of crap that they are dish out that's it

[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.520]
So there's a riccan trudge story there is chapter number one today

[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.780]
Let me dispense with the fk marting real quickly. Okay, kym art sucks Tom Cruise was right

[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.400]
I told you the story yesterday about how my toilet seat the little latch on the back whatever the henge broke

[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:33.080]
Okay, these things happen big deal planned out ceilessments. They could make him to last the lifetime if they wanted to but they don't

[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.840]
So yesterday I get out of here. I go over to kym art. Why did I go to kym art? I don't know because it's there

[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.780]
That that's why I don't have like no little mom and pop hardware stores in my neighborhood and

[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.340]
You know as far as going to builders square home depot

[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:51.320]
They're big gigantic. Yeah, they are it's a pin in the ass to go in those places for me

[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:57.160]
So I go into kym art and not realizing that it's a couple of days after Christmas and they are

[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:03.240]
Packed this is a start. It's usually empty by the way because malt Walmart open across the street and it's basically putting these people out of business

[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:10.720]
But they are packed. I mean they're lined up in there like they were giving away $50 bills to everyone except to the cash register

[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.960]
And I thought well, you know, I got plenty of time before the hockey game. I'll just hang out and though

[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.600]
I'll get my thing back there and I'll just wait how long they got away

[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:25.080]
So I go in the back way in the back as far in the back as you can go and they're in the hardware area. There are some toilet seats

[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:32.180]
But what do I know about toilet seats? Okay, I mean I look and here's one here's another one this color this

[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.040]
Okay, so finally I'm looking at the prices. I don't care about price you know me

[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.720]
When you make the big bucks. You're not like Jeff rumor. Okay. I'm not a kind of guy would go in and buy a used toilet seat like rumor

[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.980]
To save two bucks

[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:48.560]
So I go in here and I pick out a seat which looks to me like a toilet seat

[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.500]
It looks like maybe you know a shade that might come close to matching whatever the old woman. I go online

[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:59.140]
I'm standing there. I'm waiting. I'm and by the way you people online there at Kmart you people the cash years

[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:00.580]
They just don't care

[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.980]
They don't care she's taking her sweet time and it's like and of course all the glamour in there

[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:12.080]
They're buying next year's Christmas stuff now because it's all marked down 80 90% right after this Christmas

[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:18.820]
So they're buying all the decorations all the light bulbs which by the way, they could use one of those red lights for their got game last night

[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:26.040]
But nevertheless so they're lined up buying all this crap. I finally check out I go through the thing. I take it home

[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.880]
And being the very industrious person that I am I you know take the old one off the toilet

[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:37.500]
I unbracket the little the the plastic bolts. I take the new one out of the box. I said

[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.360]
I sit it on there and all of a sudden I realize

[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.760]
That compared to my toilet. This is like a baby toilet seat

[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.980]
Like for a baby ass

[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.700]
Not for a big fat ass like me

[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.580]
And it comes out like about three quarters of the way to the front over my toilet ends

[00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:04.920]
Is this gonna work? No, no, am I gonna go back to came art to return this piece of direct? No, is it in my dumpster now? Yes

[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.580]
$10 dollars to say I knew something was gonna go down the toilet. It wound up being the uh toilet seat right down the toilet

[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:21.260]
So now I got to make another trip to builders square home depot George tells me one of these places and find a real toilet seat for a real human being with a real ass

[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.540]
Not some kind of a baby. You know what I'll give you another example. I went and

[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.560]
Uh, this is what you get for shopping at came art. Okay, and I'm admitting it

[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:35.560]
I went in there a few months ago all the traveling that I do and I bought myself because I like having a one piece

[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:42.880]
Luggage you know one one piece bag. I never checked baggage. That's the worst thing you can do when you do all the traveling that I do a one

[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.040]
Bag deal where it's big enough to carry everything you need

[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.540]
So I get a bag that's got of course to handle on the wheels

[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.720]
I mean you got to be a schmuck anymore to carry around a big bag in the airports

[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:57.720]
Only by the way they finally forgot to mention they finally got carts in Miami international last week

[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:03.120]
The last airport in the human race and it's only two bucks. What a bargain, huh

[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.780]
Every airport in Europe they have all the carts you want through all free

[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.140]
You know carts that you put your stuff on so you don't have to go get a hernia

[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:17.680]
Miami international airport we finally got 2400 carts and they're only two dollars a piece

[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.180]
What a bargain almost as much of a bargain as the parking and port water bill report

[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.260]
But at any rate

[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:30.160]
So let's be able where the hell was I got lost I'm in the middle of so many goddamn things going on here with the oh

[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.580]
Oh, yeah, so I get a bag and I take the bag home

[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.300]
I fill it up. I'm going on my trip wherever I'm going and I realize it's like a baby

[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.860]
The handle is down to like your knee you know, I'm talking about in other words it's too short

[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.720]
Everything it came art is too short

[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.360]
The toilet seat is too short the goddamn luggage thing is too short

[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.080]
Already got something that's too short. I don't need anything else that's too short

[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.160]
So if you want to come out up on the short end of the stick that's a good place to go is came art

[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.520]
I'll never ever go there again

[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.020]
They make me sick to my stomach and like I said, I'll have to want to go to Home Depot

[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.840]
Now next order of business today for we have a lot of business today. Oh, yes, we do you'd letter this morning

[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.120]
And on the outside of the envelope it says sun sentinel

[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.740]
And up above where it says sun sentinel is called nevans edit whatever it how that means

[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.460]
That's what it says

[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.120]
I'll open it up. Obviously. It's from the anxious buddy nevin

[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.180]
He's an asshole. Yeah, and it says December 22nd

[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:40.560]
It took quite a while to get here. Of course. He sent it to the Sheridan Street address. We're not on Sheridan Street. Okay, Puts Putsala

[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.940]
Mr. Rogers I have been told about your comments on the irregarding my column

[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.280]
Center one is a worthy charity, but remember one different

[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.320]
Not one difference one different between you and Wayne Heizinger

[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.100]
Heizinger reached in his pocket for a million dollars. You reached in your listeners pockets

[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.540]
Have a wonderful holiday season sincerely buddy nevans sun sentinel

[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.400]
A lovely letter at this holiday time of year. Well, let me say one thing about buddy nevin

[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.400]
He's an asshole. In fact, I think he and Pete Bolger are the same person. You know what I'm talking about

[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.860]
I think they're the same never saw him together

[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.400]
Anybody see them together? No, same person

[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:22.320]
You see I hate to break the news to you, but every year in fact this year

[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.100]
I donated my money up front so we can get the campaigns started

[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:30.820]
Because this company is too cheap. I'm like iod this outfit is too cheap to give a seed money to get the

[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.220]
CDs and the cassettes going and put up the front money

[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:38.220]
So I donated my $10,000 this year like I do every year. I don't expect the middle for it

[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.860]
They sent me a nice letter from center one. They're very grateful for it

[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.880]
And it's the least I can do for something that I'm trying to raise money for okay

[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.280]
And I've done this for several many years now many years whether it was Camilo sauce or center one

[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.460]
I've donated $10,000 every year

[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.200]
To whatever charity I was raising money for on the year

[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:02.140]
Now I realize 10,000 is an omitted but I'm figuring out mathematically based on what Wayne is worth his net worth or allegedly

[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.020]
And what my net worth is allegedly

[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:09.860]
That if I gave $10,000 for him to do the equivalent he'd have to give 10 million dollars

[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:15.360]
To charity not one million that would be the equivalent based on his net value of a billion dollars

[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.020]
Did he give 10 million dollars? No

[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.340]
Did he give five million? No

[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.100]
And not only that but you know something if he did give 10 million he's an asshole

[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.080]
He's still an asshole

[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:34.600]
So you can throw all the little shots and all the digs and not you know and not recognize or pretend you don't recognize the fact that I give as much as I can afford to air every year

[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:39.760]
And that we did raise over 125 grand and who knows it'll wind up 130 or whatever wind up you

[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:46.260]
You can continue avoiding to recognize that putting them in and the fact that you've got your tongue way deep inside Wayne hyping the rectum

[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.820]
That's okay. That's up that's up to you

[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.120]
Because the fact is if you went out and took a survey all around town

[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:57.540]
Regardless of what Neil Rogers said on the radio most people you would talk to in this town if you asked him about Wayne hyping

[00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.340]
What would say he's an asshole that's right. That's what they would say

[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.300]
Regardless of how much money he's given a charity how many sports franchises he brought us

[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:10.600]
If he never stole a freight train a caboose whatever it would still say he's an asshole exactly

[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.420]
So there you go. I wets my case on that

[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.460]
I don't want to go and we forget that here's modern you rock column by that Howard deal

[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.720]
From the city link that's that's great

[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.440]
Want to see we do have some journalists in his town. The problem is they're not working for the so-called mainstream newspaper

[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.920]
So nobody reads their stuff

[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.080]
I got a lot to say about you panther people out there now

[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:35.060]
Get it out of my system once and for all today. It'll be a cleansing experience

[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:41.040]
It's the holidays and after this I won't have to burden the rest of you with it because I know 98% of you don't care about it in the first place

[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.580]
But last night, I mean just

[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.060]
Unbelieveable just astonishing

[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.160]

a Mont-ezleusful world 180 points, and Mont-ezleusful unter the br supporters of Company也 has heard the Friday night news.

[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:50.380]
always said okay make our day. There you go. They're just inviting us to blow them

[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.740]
into the stone age and we're saying okay whatever you like. Right. What's wrong with that?

[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.440]
So anyway you know Hank loves I mentioned this yesterday talking about the

[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.200]
factual errors in the herald. I think we could make we could have an encyclopedia

[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.660]
each year. That would be a great thing to come out with at the end of the year.

[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.760]
Here are all the factual errors that were printed as fact in the herald in the

[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.960]
last year. Probably fill up volumes and volumes and volume. But at any rate for

[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.080]
example today David Janiel and writing about last night's hockey game which

[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:24.540]
I'll get to momentarily. David Janiel talks about the laws got a goal and

[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:29.700]
this one did this. He said Mark Lawrence got the aisles to within one but the

[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.860]
goal the oler's wanted and didn't get was Marius Turekowski shot that

[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.840]
hit Birken mid-Sahabad et cetera. Well Mark Lawrence didn't get the oler's to

[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.880]
within one because after the score was two to nothing was that were they ever

[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.560]
within one during the entire game last night. No it was a two nothing that was

[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.340]
three nothing that it was three to one three to one. How can they have gotten

[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.940]
them to within one when the score at that point when Mark Lawrence got that goal

[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.900]
for the islanders was three to one David J. Shwell how is that possible do you

[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.940]
have any idea? No. Oh okay just another I mean it's not a big deal but just an

[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.460]
example of the kind of thought and the kind of care that goes into the

[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:07.020]
garbage that's written for news and your newspapers here especially the herald

[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:12.260]
which specializes in crap. Yes nice going David Janiel if you pay a little

[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.480]
more attention to what's going on out there and what you're writing as opposed

[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.540]
to being a militant whatever the hell you are you we all be a hell of a lot

[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:23.220]
better off for it. Now I don't know where to start next whether I should go to my

[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:27.880]
thing about this event we had last night. Nice call by the way Panthers. Nice

[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:32.260]
call Sean Burke. And did I tell you Ray Whitney is glad but they don't understand

[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:40.260]
they had no clue these people as a group have no freaking clue. It's like I'm in

[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.600]
some kind of a battle to prove something to people who just resisted if you

[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:48.380]
like vanilla ice cream great you eat vanilla ice cream I'll eat the fish

[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:54.800]
food okay and we'll all be happy. 23 years I've been in this town always like

[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.380]
way out there on a limb you're not part of the mainstream thank God thank God

[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.780]
who what does anybody want to be part of the so-called mainstream in this

[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.420]
place. No. In his outdoor funeral parlour. No. No I don't. Josh

[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.600]
Friedman at the game last night brings me thank you Josh almost redeem

[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:14.760]
themself for not paying any attention on our show yesterday brings me the

[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:19.680]
December 28th issue of the sporting news that's got Vinny Tessby Birdies picture

[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.420]
there on the front and on page nine if you happen to be one of those people that

[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:31.160]
reads the sporting news very timely the dance of the happy people and here's the

[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:36.480]
whole history of all these dances that these a goofballs do and have been doing

[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.780]
in the NFL for years now going all the way back to Elmo right to the Kansas

[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:45.940]
City Chiefs in 1973 and right on through to the funky chicken and the dirty

[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:50.940]
bird. There you go I'll get in that later. Nice going there Josh boy talk about

[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:55.060]
timely the dirty bird come on let's start doing the dirty bird right in the

[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.520]
middle of the show too bad we still don't have that whammy thing going on that

[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.160]
would have put us over the top. That's right it there's there's that Jew with a

[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.980]
Yamakan there's that old bag with a Yamaka doing the dirty bird I bet you

[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.740]
know there's no other fat old Jew with the Yamakan doing the dirty bird in the

[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.160]
entire universe. There you go. They'll be going.

[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:19.980]
Anyway getting well see first of all here's let me get to this 17,000

[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.420]
tickets still not sold this is for a playoff game the dolphins in the

[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:28.620]
builds the Saturday at P.P. Park ABC's telecast the Saturday's dolphins

[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:32.940]
builds playoff game at pro player stadium is in danger of being blacked out

[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:38.080]
locally is what it says. The dolphins sold 11,000 tickets Monday but is

[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.740]
of late in the afternoon about 17,000 tickets remained unsolved the blackout

[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.580]
deadline is 12 30 p.m. Wednesday meaning tomorrow but the dolphins are likely to

[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:50.960]
seek an extension and even if they do get an extension like till Thursday they'll

[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.060]
have till Thursday at 12 30 or one o'clock or whenever the hell it is and if

[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.760]
they're not sold out by then and if they have more than just I mean no matter

[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.420]
which their channel locally should the ABC so channel 10 are they going to buy

[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:05.360]
up like eight or 10,000 tickets. No of course not. I mean if it gets down to

[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.220]
a couple of thousand they'll buy them up like the other stations always have to

[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:13.200]
do so make sure it gets on TV and they can make the revenue from it. Now the

[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.640]
reason I mentioned that is because that should tell you and of course the fact

[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:21.200]
that the Huracun's are playing in this bogus this micron PC not to be confused

[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.120]
with the pool and weedwacker bowl game tonight and they're praying to have like

[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.720]
45,000 people in there. Can you imagine if you didn't have the Huracun's in

[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.440]
there. No. Can't even imagine what they'd have for this. What's nobody cares

[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.480]
about. It's part of the fact this is supposed to be such a big diet in the

[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:43.800]
whole sports town. Anybody believe that? No. So we go back to last night's game

[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:49.160]
in the Macarena. They I can handle the fact that the escalator was yesterday

[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.900]
working last night. No. I can handle that. Wasn't working. Okay. No problem. It

[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.880]
was raining out there. If there's a cloud in the sky the escalator don't work.

[00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:01.500]
Okay. Big deal. You know I'm already I've already you know in spite of what

[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.440]
Rimmer promises me he's going to talk to Steve Dangerfield and this one's going to

[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:09.200]
talk to that one. They don't care that we can't see the goal light. There were

[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:15.700]
let's see there were six goals in the game last night and let me think five of

[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.960]
them were scored to my right. The shoot twice and they call it with the

[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.380]
panther shoot in the first and third period. Five of them were scored down there.

[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:26.760]
Did we ever see the goal light come on for any one of those goals? But you know

[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:32.240]
something they don't care. They don't care about the fans because they sold it

[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.340]
out. The place was rockin jam packed with people. The overwhelming majority. I'm

[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:40.000]
coming to work this morning and I'm trying in my mind to be fair. I'm thinking of a

[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.940]
number. I'm thinking of the experience their last night and I'm thinking to myself

[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:49.780]
a number. A percentage of ballpark number that I could determine of people who are

[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.980]
in that arena who understand the game who are knowledgeable fans who have some

[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:57.880]
idea what's going on who's opinion really means something is based on something as

[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:03.960]
opposed to those who are just assholes. 80% of the people in that place last

[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:09.540]
night haven't got a clue what that game is all about. So I'm saying 20% of us

[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:14.720]
20% understand the game. We appreciate the players who really count really who

[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:19.380]
really contribute something to the team and we'll give in game and they're 80% of

[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:23.260]
the people in there who might as well go to the WWF. That's why see my idea fell on

[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:27.600]
deaf ears. I still think it was the greatest idea in history. Save Baldy 30

[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:32.960]
more than 30 million dollars and just have a social club in there and we'll be

[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.780]
playing Gary Glitter. It will be Scream and Juck and Juck and Juck and Juck and

[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.840]
Jive and we'll be doing the dirty bird and the funky chicken and look at each

[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:45.620]
other off on the screen. We'll be on a cell phone. You know I should have

[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.480]
realized when John Van Beesbro came back because the first five years that we

[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:54.620]
had a team other there were two players that they knew the names of these fans

[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:59.160]
and I used the term loosely they knew bees are bees are well it's easy to say

[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:04.260]
bees are they knew that and they knew stews as easy to say that too stew they

[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:09.440]
knew him well he went away. So it came down to the point where all the only

[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:15.040]
player they knew was Beesbro basically that was it. I mean once once a while they

[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.720]
knew you know Eddie but it's kind of hard to go special ed special ed it's not

[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.060]
a real good chance it doesn't roll off your tongue really special ed doesn't

[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:29.160]
roll off your tongue real well. So I shouldn't know when he came back he was

[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:33.240]
filled out for you early this season and at least half if not more in fact

[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.820]
maybe it was the 80% of the people who are assholes in that joint maybe it was

[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:42.720]
those 80% who boot him and I have no idea why I still to this day can't figure

[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:47.500]
out why except for the fact that they know nothing and they have no class they

[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.640]
don't appreciate a great performance they don't know they don't know who's

[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.480]
doing well who's doing what and they don't care quite frankly because they're

[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.400]
too busy socializing including some of the people who are sitting in front of

[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.540]
me who showed up again last night who liked to hold their little kids up in the

[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.200]
ear in front of our face while the game is going on and who likes to talk to

[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.400]
their friends who come over and talk to them while the game is going on and

[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:14.340]
stand in front of you so you can't see what's going on I mean I went through I

[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:17.600]
don't know how many games a lot of games that I kept my mouth shut I didn't say

[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.780]
because I'm not one of those people at once that wants to start a big screaming

[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.620]
match during the goddamn stands I mean these people are gonna be there a long

[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:28.680]
time I'm sure and I'm gonna be there for a four more seasons so I'll be god

[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:32.500]
them if I want to have like a big saw an adense with people but Jesus Christ some

[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:36.080]
of us want to actually see the game we didn't just come there to smooth and

[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.040]
admire your little kids that you showed up very late in the first period and

[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.540]
left with about ten minutes left in the game and most of the time we were

[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:45.020]
there weren't paying any attention anyway what are you doing there if you want

[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:49.780]
to smooth there's a hallway out there there's a big beautiful palatial lobby

[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.600]
there's seating there's a food there's restaurant there's all kind of stuff

[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.740]
go out there and smooth your hearts can't death but don't stand in front of

[00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:03.140]
other people's faces who want to see a goddamn game which we actually had

[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.860]
about seven or eight minutes in that game in a second and third period where

[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.180]
both teams were like actually somebody like somebody who let a goddamn match

[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:13.780]
under the rest anywhere back in port it was like a real hockey game for about

[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:20.680]
seven or eight minutes but to the people that show up there to the 80% of them

[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.520]
the you know nothing's they appreciate the guys that are really performing

[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.140]
well like Sean Burke is playing greatly the when they announce his name at the

[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:31.540]
starting line up is there any reaction no no when Ray Whitney scores one of

[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:35.440]
the most unbelievable goals one of the one on three an effort to like so

[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:41.720]
what you may see like once a year in the league do they appreciate that no what

[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.380]
do they like they like to be to they appreciate Paul laws and Bill Lindsay have

[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:49.100]
been on the team since the very beginning Lindsay with five goals in five

[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.960]
games and Paul laws the first goal in about 20,000 games but beats the crap out

[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.200]
of whoever he takes on is the real enforcer on this team do they appreciate

[00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:03.600]
them no no there are no hero is the big black guy named Peter no yeah there you

[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:11.700]
go 80% of these people out of their mind they wouldn't know a hockey player if

[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.020]
he stuck his stick in their rectum twisted it till their kishkeys came out

[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:23.860]

[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:55.120]
get enough not since William Chatter's Lucy in the sky with diamonds and Pat

[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:59.420]
Boone's tutti fruity had there been such a torrid juxtaposition of an Anglo-oriented

[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:04.520]
song stylist interpreting otherwise enjoyable soulful melodic renderings pardon me

[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:12.440]
ma'am but when would be a convenient time for you and I to get it on oh yeah my

[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:17.960]
mojo is working I think it is plus if you act now we'll throw in at some

[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.780]
additional charge a free bonus track of Mr. Grammar's stirring windation of

[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:26.840]
ice case chat would you happen to be privy to the knowledge of who that African

[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:32.280]

[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:47.040]

[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.160]
right ten forty six and five sixty w two and so let's get back to those

[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.320]
knowledgeable panther fans in the rough session now you see this is the thing

[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.780]
that's frustrating me and I'm not going to change it like I said if you love

[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.780]
vanilla ice cream and I'm the only one on the whole arena that loves fish food

[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:02.620]
fine I'll stick with my fish food and you eat your vanilla and think you're

[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:08.320]
having a great time because that leaves more the really good stuff for me but

[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.040]
it's just astonishing to me that they announced the starting lineups and guys

[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.920]
who like are playing great guys who contribute guys who do something you could

[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.420]
hear a pin drop there that's the sound of silence

[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:24.400]
but every time this big black guy named Peter comes out there and steps on the ice

[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.220]
and believe me he contributes absolutely nothing

[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.960]
if we had a real good if we had like answered Carter it's got nothing to do with

[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.640]
his race it's not a racial thing if we had grandfuel in goal I'd say all right

[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:40.140]
there's a black guy who's a great player we had answered Carter we had my career

[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:43.280]
from Edmonton there's a guy who's a real player makes no difference whether he's

[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:46.620]
black or white but here's just a big goon with a G

[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.240]
who can't skate who falls down you know three four times

[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.760]
couple of shift early and again then all of a sudden we don't see him anymore for

[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.320]
a long long time now it's four to one after Whitney's growth that

[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.820]
unbelievable goal it's the third period now here he comes back out there again

[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.580]
and he elbows a guy four or five times and ahead the island of

[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.820]
defenseman he provokes him into a fight they drop the gloves and uh yeah

[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.160]
where L takes about four or five good shops in a post he gives one back and then he

[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.480]
falls on the guy to an actually whoever falls on top because the people here

[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.760]
think this is the WWF they don't really understand we're winning a hockey fight

[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.160]
is all about whoever falls on top he wins oh

[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:27.000]
the Croat goes a shot if you pardon that expression they go nuts

[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.560]
and now when he goes into the penalty box and I'm sure this was done for my benefit

[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.500]
you're not fooling me there's no way anybody can be this stupid there's a group

[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.120]
of assholes on the other side for me and they're going

[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.640]
Peter Peter

[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.740]
and we're looking at each other in my section like are these people out of their

[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:52.800]
mind yes are they nuts yes do they have any clue as to what's going on here no

[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:57.040]
see there is a guy who's an enforcer on this team our equivalent of like

[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:01.100]
tied dummy is paulas he's been here right from the beginning he's a

[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.620]
little player scored a goal last night by the way did Peter well score a goal

[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:09.680]
we're going to hold our breath till he scores one no no paulas good solid

[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:13.120]
defenseman he's the enforcer he's the guy that other teams fear as far as

[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.400]
fighting his concern he's a real fighter not just some guy who happens to be a

[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.100]
big ox who can't skate

[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.600]
and it's been this way for six years now no matter what I say it's like a

[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:27.740]
battle like I they're going to show me that they're smart on dumb I know

[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:32.880]
nothing when I talked about stewbar yeah you're full of crap Chris Wells the

[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.280]
spokesman chase he's got to be a superstar okay how's Chris Wells anybody

[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.840]
seeing him lately no no I talked about Marty Stracca oh you're wrong Doug

[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.200]
McLean he's a genius Marty Stracca he ain't no good

[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.540]
he's seen Doug McLean lately no yeah

[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.720]
so no matter what it is I say I know nothing and I'm going to try to convince

[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.920]
20,000 people out there that I'm the expert I don't care about being the

[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.980]
expert anymore than I care about whether they hey Neil you know I don't go

[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:02.820]
out there for affirmation for any of that I go out there to watch a hockey game

[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.140]
and all these people that come by all these villains of people hey Neil I've

[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:12.600]
your show I know they're listening are they learning anything no today do they

[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.260]
understand what they're seeing in front of their eyes no they they want to see

[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:19.040]
the WWF they don't understand what a real hockey player means they don't get it

[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.700]
there is nobody and I don't care what John David's

[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:27.180]
instead in a moment of ankle her it's a few weeks ago there is nobody in the

[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:31.140]
league who would define this guy as a hockey player and if these this crowd they

[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:36.060]
are obsessed with him obsessed in fact I think if we said okay we'll

[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.120]
trade away everybody else on the team and we'll just put him out there just to

[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.340]
fight the other day they go yeah there you go right that's right

[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:45.680]
they be in a frenzy they be squeezing themselves and each other

[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.900]
just a deprospect of it

[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.900]
so it's your comment no surprise that I'm the only one out of you know

[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.960]
20,000 people that find the grotesque that we can't see the red light when a

[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:03.660]
goal is scored or all the other technical they they got the sound

[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:08.960]
straight now last night there you go one at a time maybe by the year 25 25

[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.040]
that $200 million dollar limit out there we'll get that all straight enough

[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.260]
because I'm going there for a different reason than the majority of you people

[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.640]
are going there I'm going there because I'm a hockey fan oh yeah I'm sorry

[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:26.720]
excuse me I'm not there going out there to waste my time watching a bunch of

[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.920]
a bunch of bogus fights I've seen 80 million hockey fights and 99% of mark

[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:35.340]
crap they're nothing they're a bunch of bull crap is what they are

[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.540]
but to watch the way the crowd reacts just uh crap yeah

[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.600]
and that behavior last night that uh and and like I said yeah

[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:51.480]
Ray Whitney scored this unbelievable goal unbelievable he left this

[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.720]
kid burry Richter he left his jockstrap right there on the ice went right to

[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.760]
round him as he was as if he weren't there on a one on three there's no other

[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.420]
panther player the offensive zone he skates right around him go through the net makes

[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:06.240]
one shot and uh what's his name stops it kusano stops it and he's right there for the rebound

[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.380]
a Whitney stuff set in the short side and they're just unbelievable goal the

[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:12.380]
place should have erupted they should have given him a standing ovation they

[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:16.580]
announced the goal in my friend Sean was at the game with me last night notice he

[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:20.600]
stood up like there was going to be a standing ovation for Ray Whitney I didn't

[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.580]
stand up because I knew and boy his ass was back in a seat in a half a

[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:29.920]
second because he looked around to oops oops because the other 19 000 some

[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.720]
odd people in there they were all sitting on your ass

[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.300]
that's why you hear all these calls on this radio station oh damn merino sucks he's

[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:44.580]
there see that because the people in this town don't even know a good player they

[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.700]
don't know a good effort what do they know does anybody know what these people

[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.760]
know I don't know I've been here for 23 years I can't figure out what it is that

[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.820]
thing no no what do they know no

[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:01.120]
yeah seriously what do they know oh man

[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:10.180]
I mean it would be like sitting in the middle of a of a of a of a park and an elephant fall

[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:13.460]
you're sitting in the middle of the central park in New York and there's 500 people

[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:19.280]
sitting around you and an elephant falls out of the sky and you say oh my god it's an elephant

[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:23.140]
and they say oh no it's it's a bunch of thousand dollar bills

[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:31.120]
and you're saying well jeez I guess the other 499 people can't be wrong it looks like an elephant

[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:40.360]
to me but it must be a bunch of money why do I get so agitated and so frustrated and you know

[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:45.740]
what's the point is it ever going to change of course not they could have a team here for 500

[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:49.440]
years and they're still not going to learn anything about it and like I said before the people

[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.800]
that are sitting there who want to get in everybody else's way and a lot of come over in shmuz

[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.880]
you've got all this time before the game you've got time in between periods you've got time

[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:01.260]
after the game go out there on your cell phone talk to each other don't stand in front of people's

[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:05.400]
faces maybe the few of us who really are interested in watching what's going on I know that's a

[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:12.140]
it's a revolutionary concept in this town that somebody could go to a sporting event and actually

[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:18.960]
be interested in seeing what's going on out there I'm not impressed by everybody holding their

[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.820]
little kids up in the air in front of my face I don't care there's a million little kids there

[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:26.660]
in the arena you want to see them look up on the screen up there they're all jukin and driving

[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:30.800]
and they're doing the dirty bird great they're having a good time fine but when you look up on the

[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:35.160]
screen it doesn't block you view of what you supposedly pay the sea out there which is a sporting

[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:42.120]
event and you hear this air everywhere you go in this town people go to see live theaters

[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:46.700]
they go to see a play they go to see a concert and people are like rude they leave early they

[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:52.340]
stand up in front they don't care about anybody else why do you think the driving is the way it is

[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:56.940]
here I'm the only one out here don't you understand don't interfere with my drive my road and my

[00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:01.480]
this is my time now don't interfere with me you've got some goddamn nerve

[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:11.220]
boy it it's just it's astonishing it looks to me just like a goddamn big elephant but it's money

[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.600]
it's pennies from heaven pennies from rumor

[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:24.160]
and these people man trying to convince them of it that's and that's why you hear no hockey talk

[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:28.800]
that's just an issue but in this whole radio station maybe three calls a week maybe at most

[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.320]
because how can you possibly discuss something intelligently when you haven't got the

[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.080]
foggiest idea what it's all about

[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.660]
and I try to be fair I'm not a big Sean Burke fan to say the least but the last couple of weeks

[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:49.120]
he's played great sensational he was spectacular last night except the one greasy goal I went into

[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.860]
was like in the din count anyway because Lance Roberts food the whistle too soon thank God but

[00:46:52.860 --> 00:47:00.360]
nevertheless he played great give credit where credit is due what is it that these people see

[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:06.180]
out there and like I was talking yesterday you can't fool me about this issue okay because white

[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:10.700]
people and especially out there in sunrise what have we got we got upper middle and upper class people

[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:19.640]
for the most part white almost all white they love seeing a big black guy go out there on their side

[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:24.540]
on their team and their neighborhood but beaten the crap out of somebody else they're going

[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:28.480]
oh you go get him Lee Roy alright go boy

[00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:01.100]
interested people in the game that was sitting around me yeah it's unbelievable what's going on

[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:04.420]
over there they just have no interest and they're schmoosing and they're talking and they're

[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:09.280]
standing standing by the way the usher is up there I do a pretty crappy job of keeping people out

[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.100]
of those aisles while the game is going on I know no one has that business standing in the

[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:17.780]
house talking to people blocking your view while the game is going on no one has any respect and

[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:23.580]
Paul Laws scores the first goal since 1996 right nobody knows what the crap's going on they don't

[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:29.940]
even they don't get into it until the big black guy comes out there then they're foaming at

[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:33.800]
the mouth they're squeezing themselves they're wiping themselves they're just they're foaming at

[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:38.560]

oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T where I'm just checking here's a mobile and Hollywood hello

[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:29.380]
nail god yes sir you know my exact sentiments along with you you know look we don't need another

[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:33.340]
enforcer on this team we've got laws we've had them for a long time this team doesn't have an

[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:37.840]
off half this team doesn't have enough talent on it to have two enforcers on it whoever heard

[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:42.320]
this such a thing what in the world do we need this guy out there he's just worthless he doesn't

[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:46.200]
bring anything to the team well how come when but you know what's going to happen here today the

[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:50.060]
guy that called a minute ago and you that's all I'm going to hear from today the people the other 80

[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:54.780]
or 90 percent of the people that are having orgasms over this guy they won't call and tell us what

[00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:59.440]
that's all about what they're so excited about you don't win hockey games by fighting

[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:04.000]
well no first certainly about look first of all in this hot run the team said winning five or

[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.120]
the last seven games he has had nothing to do let me say it again nothing to do with the success

[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:14.780]
of winning any of those games nothing the only thing is about laws is that he's become such a

[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:19.580]
fine defenseman I think that you kind of hate to see him go out there and take a penalty and be

[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:24.080]
off the ice because he really does play real good day yeah you know better better than he did

[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:28.640]
like day even they last year they don't know from him they get they get somewhat emotional when

[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:32.920]
he gets into a fight but other than that but when the big black guy comes out there these people lose

[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:38.520]
it baby they're out their minds and was that sweet we Whitney deep deep and get his own rebound

[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:43.300]
absolutely absolutely anything it would have been nice if we could see the red light out of that

[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:47.860]
end because he had a wait until he puts a stick up in here in a celebration he gave us about

[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:53.240]
at least oh I don't know four or five different looks at it yeah it was sweet nail it really was

I heard this more than our Thomas which I heard about the last two minutes of that the

[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:09.920]

[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:16.500]
yes sir yeah I'm waiting to talk to you you're speaking to him sir oh hey you know I want to

[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:21.320]
let you know that you're talking about the red light they got it every goal now they show it on

[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:26.180]
TV the goal with the cage around it the goal light they show it every single goal now

[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:31.260]
you know I don't care what they're doing on TV the fans who are in the stands sitting on

[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:37.660]
on the whatever side I'm on you can't see it that's who one more thing we got to have the best

[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:43.820]
checking line in the NHL with uh mixed Lindsay and Marlowe they're just playing so hard right now

[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:48.280]
great last night yeah he didn't get any credit but he's played real well last time Lindsay got

[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:53.480]
five goal and if you were if you were to go in a crowd ask who Alex fixes what number he is they go

[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:59.240]
uh who yeah exactly right this coil down it that's why I don't even go to the game is just more

[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:03.220]
enjoyable at home I believe me believe you're getting a much better view anyway you don't have

[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:07.660]
anybody standing up in front of your head and if you do you have to double mount okay down have a

[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:12.800]
written here we have an open line at day one and Broward five six seven oh five sixty pound five

[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:19.220]
sixty on seriously I just don't understand how people can be so god damn into themselves and so

[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:24.160]
rude as to stand there in front of you I mean it's not like somebody just had a hard attack and

[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:28.300]
crumpled in front of you or something or like they had a medical emergency they're standing they're

[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:32.460]
schmoosing and they know you want to see the god damn game and they still don't care

[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:37.900]
and then after after like I said if you do a bunch of jarrations and finally start looking really

[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:42.020]
agitated like you're about to open your mouth and start screaming then they finally like kneel down

[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:46.060]
but they have to continue their conversation which can't which is much too important and of course

[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:50.440]
they're talking to people that are paying their attention to the game anyway that are doodling

[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:56.440]
their little kids for like two and a half hours I don't get it why are you people there why do you

[00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:00.700]
show up I am and you know something just figured it out they are there they're there to annoy

[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:04.740]
the rest of us they the twenty percent of us that really are into it and really want to see it

[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:08.700]
they come there just to piss us off and they're doing a great job yes thank you

[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:15.760]
here's a mobile invoker hello you know I have an interesting thing here has anybody seen Chris

[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:19.880]
Wells and Peter were all at the same time together yeah I think he's just doing a black face

[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:24.360]
I think that's what it is they they they they don't they were so embarrassed that they had to take

[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:28.980]
them and dress them up and and you'll recall when I was on your screaming about that grotesque

[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:32.380]
trade which wasn't just due Barnes by the way it was also Jason will he was playing great for buffalo

[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:37.720]
when it went after that trade and and all this all these so-called fans got on the side oh yeah Chris

[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.920]
Wells is great we believe the lay Brian Murray and remember it was up there oh it's a standing

[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:45.340]
ovation he finally got to go a standing ovation like that there's not a standing ovation for

[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:49.840]
every goal I mean just embarrassing himself with a ton of so far up Brian Murray's vector who is

[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:55.060]
embarrassing at least with the standing part at least he could stand he came stand on

[00:56:55.060 --> 00:57:00.500]
face no but seriously what doesn't am I the only person who is shocked by this psychotic reaction

[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:05.040]
to Peter will rel what is that all about it what is it quote the equivalent of Eddie when Eddie

[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:10.580]
was getting in all the fights a couple years ago Eddie Eddie now it's Peter Peter it's uh it's the

[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:15.920]
the play of Dejore what's who we're gonna root for today I believe no no you're the night I don't

[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:20.020]
think so I the I mean this is like a steamroller this is gaining momentum they're obsessed they have

[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:25.380]
they have Peter blow up the house see I prefer myself I prefer myself Peter North they like Peter

[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:29.960]
or L okay I mean you know you pick your own Peter I guess Peter's pepper picked a we have an

[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:34.400]
open line is brown it five six seven how's that called Peter's Piker peck uh by however it goes

[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:39.760]
better slow down because you get a lot of trouble with that thing and don't be saying the peckers by

[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:48.620]
the way nine minutes after eleven at five sixty WQF five way buddy bus that looks pretty good

[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:58.100]
in my perspective hey so the radio station now the future is in town boy we've been talking about

[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:07.200]
hi sons ever since cops pulled out now we'll work for Texas the fifth million and okay

[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:22.620]
like we need more hair yes you guys think that it's a bummer when bell and rees gone are you

[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.640]
oh

[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:47.240]
again Christian she can

[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:54.140]
You want to change the stations, letters, the WGOT.

[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:56.160]
Now we'll work for breakfast.

[00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.440]
We've got a new song.

[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.740]
We're gonna work for breakfast.

[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.960]
Have some breakfast, sign on the ground.

[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:14.220]
Yeah, buddy Bugsdont looked pretty good in retrospect.

[00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:15.420]
He was an asshole before.

[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:17.540]
Was he great compared to Queer Channel or what?

[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:18.080]
Oh, wow.

[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.460]
As the assassin just running loose.

[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:21.860]
And of course, isn't that interesting to see

[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:23.120]
Pete Boulders checkered parents.

[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:24.740]
It was God Gannett broadcasting.

[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:25.880]
He was their hatchet man.

[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.020]
And then they sold that outfit to a Paxon.

[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:29.160]
He was their hatchet man.

[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:30.180]
And now it's Queer Channel.

[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:31.200]
It doesn't make any difference.

[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:34.880]
He's still the assassin is what he is.

[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:35.160]
Okay.

[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:36.800]
Roaning other people's lives.

[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.920]
Destroying the Alistair's listing habit.

[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:41.920]
Doing whatever he can to inject his special brand of craft

[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:42.960]
into the radio business.

[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.640]
And doing a super job by the way, Pete.

[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.780]
I'm really doing it, baby.

[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:48.800]
Here's a mobile invoke.

[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:49.120]
Hello.

[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:50.500]
Hi, Neil. How are you?

[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:51.020]
Okay, sir.

[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:54.840]
I was sitting in the section last night directly across the ice

[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:55.680]
from your section.

[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:56.000]
Right.

[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.400]
And I saw that woman in the aisle and that

[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.640]
Thomas colored pantsuit talking to the friend

[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.560]
just in front of you.

[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.200]
And I said talking with a lot of crap.

[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:04.500]
Yeah.

[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.140]
And I said, oh my God, but I can't tomorrow you're gonna be...

[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:08.920]
I was in the middle of...

[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.500]
No, listen, first the husband comes over.

[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.700]
Obviously, these people are friends or acquaintances,

[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:16.140]
whatever of these very important people who sit in front of me.

[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:17.200]
Won't you be five or six games.

[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.440]
First, the husband comes over and he's standing there.

[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.300]
And then he finally crouches down when he realizes,

[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.920]
yeah, I'm starting to get really agitated.

[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:27.740]
And then as soon as he puts his ass back in the seat over there,

[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:29.940]
she comes over and she pulls the same routine.

[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.560]
What did that we barely say?

[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:33.280]
Exactly.

[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:34.540]
There you go.

[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:35.720]
And then I don't know.

[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:39.920]
I wouldn't think the fire by wasting my finger to put that thing

[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:40.460]
on the computer.

[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:41.240]
Okay.

[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.720]
Because if the bunch of crap is what it is.

[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.480]
I don't know, but when Peter Wurl got in that fight,

[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:48.780]
did I see a juvenile drive right after that?

[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.400]
Who was doing the funky chicken, I think,

[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.480]
a little bit very briefly.

[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.020]
I did a little merton gangster, I think.

[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.080]
And then now from my side of the ice,

[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:56.580]
I can see the gold light.

[01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.780]
Because you know why, you see,

[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:03.520]
they have the same, instead of having it screwed in straight up.

[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:04.000]
Yeah.

[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.640]
It screwed to the side.

[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.500]
So that's the side of the ice where you are.

[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.840]
That's where it screwed in.

[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.220]
So no wonder you can't see it.

[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.040]
How difficult, I mean, I know the first game that I was there,

[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.940]
we saw it go on in the LA game once.

[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:18.580]
It was only once, but nevertheless it went on.

[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:22.420]
How come it was working in the early part of the year for a couple of games,

[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.000]
and then all of a sudden they tilted it to the angle.

[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.520]
And now they can't fix it.

[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:26.400]
It's not acceptable.

[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.180]
Don't they understand it is not acceptable?

[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.580]
And if I'm the only one that keeps screaming about it,

[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.300]
I'm going to keep screaming.

[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.880]
I want to see the guy in gold light when a goal is scored.

[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.060]
And now the part where we're sitting,

[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.000]
you and Whitney got the rebound.

[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.960]
Okay, because Kuzinou came out of the net,

[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.360]
and he stuck it in behind him on the short side.

[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:44.860]
But there was no way to see it from where I was sitting,

[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.300]
and only when he put a stick up of the air started celebrating

[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.780]
that we reacted to it was a goal.

[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.720]
What kind of a bull crap show is this that these people are putting forward?

[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.080]
And they're still packing a place because these people don't care.

[01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:56.840]
They don't know the difference.

[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.560]
Well, I'm going to eat them a bunch of tickets.

[01:01:58.740 --> 01:01:59.100]
They don't know.

[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.840]
The lady sitting next to me from where we were sitting,

[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.880]
you can see that light that goes on.

[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.260]
You know when they go to a commercial or that.

[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:05.880]
Yeah, the pink light.

[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.540]
So the pink light goes on.

[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:09.880]
She says, do we score a goal?

[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.100]
Yeah.

[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.540]
I said no, it's a commercial.

[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.040]
Yeah, but at least you can see that one anyway.

[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:14.480]
That's good.

[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.500]
That's a start.

[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:16.720]
All right, Neil.

[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:19.460]
Well, get rid of those people in front of you.

[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.580]
Do something about them there.

[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.320]
They're, they're annoying just to give you off the aisle.

[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:24.040]
Okay, pal.

[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:24.620]
All right.

[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:25.380]
Have a happy new year.

[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:29.420]
Oh, God.

[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:32.540]
How come there are so many assholes in this world?

[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.240]
Inconsiderate assholes.

[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.180]
And they all decided to move to South Florida.

[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.440]
We have an open line at date, 5667-0560-050560

[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.140]
on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:44.940]
Here's Pembert Pines.

[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:45.200]
Hello.

[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:45.980]
Hello.

[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:46.640]
Yes, sir.

[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:47.360]
Yeah.

[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:49.720]
I just kind of mentioned the sports thing.

[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:51.280]
I mean, I'm not the other 80%.

[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.340]
But I'm not a true South Florida sports fan.

[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.460]
But I've noticed this.

[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:56.260]
I've gone in the games.

[01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:59.000]
And all they do is get drunk and fight,

[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.200]
especially at the dolphin games.

[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:00.380]

[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.440]
They don't pay attention to what goes right.

[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:02.660]
They just fight each other.

[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.360]
Because there's other fans there.

[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.220]
And they just don't seem to understand that they have a playoff caliber team

[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:12.300]
who was their support when a coach has to go on to the newspapers

[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:14.480]
and plead for fans to cheer.

[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:15.880]
You know, there's a problem.

[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:16.760]
There's a big one.

[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.560]
And I mean, I may not be a dolphin fan,

[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.800]
but, you know, it's your hometown team.

[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:22.660]
If you're going to go to the beginning,

[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.880]
there's no reason just to get drunk and then drive into a tree.

[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.100]
No, that's what they went there for.

[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:26.560]
You don't understand.

[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.320]
Rick Sanchez taught them that a few years ago.

[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:28.800]
Go get drunk.

[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.100]
Oh, yeah.

[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.080]
Get drunk, drive.

[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.880]
And hit any object that gets in your way, right?

[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.160]
Just like it as hard as you can.

[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.000]
Uh-huh.

[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.240]
It's just a horrible situation.

[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:39.080]
And the panthers, I mean, I don't, I was against getting a hockey team

[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.480]
to begin with because I still don't care.

[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.640]
All these people said, oh, great hockey, hockey.

[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.360]
Now, now, you know, they start.

[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.760]
We got 18, 19,000 people in game.

[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.640]
What are you talking about?

[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.500]
They're packing a joint.

[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.120]
They're making ball.

[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:48.920]
They always money, but.

[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:49.780]
No one gives it down.

[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.940]
Well, they don't care about the game,

[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:51.920]
but they're showing up anyway.

[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:52.860]
They're making us money fast.

[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:54.160]
They just want to be the store.

[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.400]
They don't contribute too much.

[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.840]
And Buddy and Evans can write 20 columns about them next year.

[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:00.480]
I don't know, but I really think we should do something.

[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.020]
I'm going to be cut off the sports for a year or two and see if people care.

[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:03.480]
Okay.

[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.300]
Sounds good to me.

[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.340]
Have a great day in New York now.

[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:05.820]
There you go.

[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:07.220]
We're living without the NBA.

[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.120]
Uh-huh.

[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:10.700]
So far, if we heard from one of those people,

[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:13.160]
one of those big Peter Rural fans to explain it to us,

[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.080]
have we heard from one?

[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:14.300]
No.

[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.820]
I mean, we're talking 80 to 90 percent of the people who just erupt,

[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:20.880]
who get spastic.

[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.020]
I mean, I'm telling you, I saw one guy.

[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.160]
I think he was giving himself a very,

[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:25.040]
I'm an enemy there understands.

[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.660]
He was so excited when that fight broke out.

[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:32.000]
In a totally meaningless, I mean, the score is four to one.

[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.240]
We got the game in a bag.

[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.640]
I mean, it said to no stress.

[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:37.960]
And this guy's like squeezing it in the bag too.

[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.580]
Two open lines in date, five, six, seven,

[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.580]
oh, five, 60, pound, five, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:48.260]
Why do I go through these same exercises when I know they're not going to call?

[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:50.320]
Because they know they don't know what they're talking about.

[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:56.640]
How can you different something when you don't even understand what they're

[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.280]
talking about?

[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.500]
We like the big spires right there.

[01:04:58.620 --> 01:04:59.460]
We got the big niggs.

[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.580]
Yeah, that must be it.

[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:01.520]
That's got to be it.

[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:05.240]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:05.460]
Hello.

[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:06.180]
Neil.

[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:06.980]
Yes, sir.

[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:07.540]
How are you doing, sir?

[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:07.820]
Okay.

[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:08.820]
Happy New Year to you.

[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:09.500]
And the same to you, sir.

[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:12.200]
I'm talking hockey with you, Neil, because you know what you're talking about.

[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.820]
What kind of a, what are you on the speaker phone?

[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.240]
Actually, no, I'm on a normal phone.

[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.820]
You're on a normal phone?

[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.080]
It's got a reverb on it.

[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.200]
I don't know why you're getting revered by apologized.

[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:23.860]
Yeah.

[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:29.260]
I just wanted to call you and let you know I didn't go to the game last night.

[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.660]
I'm originally from Chicago.

[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.680]
We have one of the worst hockey teams in the National Park.

[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:33.740]
Absolutely right.

[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.740]
What's the path that's been beaten in twice in the weekend?

[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.100]
Which we play in every week, yes?

[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.620]
And we still have fantastic fans over in Chicago, though.

[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.060]
Way different than the fans down here.

[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.400]
Well, that's, this is not Chicago.

[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.000]
I'm sure you're well aware of that, sir.

[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:47.860]
Oh, that's not Chicago.

[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:48.260]
Absolutely.

[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:49.060]
This is not Detroit.

[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:50.080]
This is not Toronto.

[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.000]
This is not Montreal.

[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.300]
This is South Florida.

[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:53.980]
This is the land of the lost.

[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.480]
I think they have absolutely no knowledge of hockey down here, unfortunately.

[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.360]
I don't understand why you don't sit in the press box, and they'll, they would be the best seat.

[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.820]
Because I don't want, because I have great seats.

[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:04.320]
I don't want to sit in the press box.

[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:06.200]
The press box is 50 miles away.

[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:09.140]
Well, he wouldn't have all this, uh, way.

[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.280]
You know, it's, sir, you know something.

[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.980]
If, if, if I, I'm, which, I can't stand your phone.

[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000]
It sounds like you're under water.

[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:18.140]
If, if I'm going to continue screaming in the oven like this, or if it, that doesn't do it.

[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:20.940]
I'm going to start telling these people about which I have no problem telling.

[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:24.060]
They're facing, even though creates an ugly situation and a real confrontation.

[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.880]
Or then I'm just going to go to the Oscars and say, look it.

[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.340]
I got some assholes down here who don't respect the fact that we want to see the game.

[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:32.280]
And they're standing up in the aisle.

[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:39.740]
And it seems only to happen or at least usually to happen when the people who were there last night,

[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:44.060]
who are there, thank God only once every five or six games with their two little punky kids,

[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.940]
taking up, uh, they got, they got four people in two seats.

[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.260]
Which is a hell of a nice deal, by the way.

[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.640]
How does that work?

[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:56.380]
You have a kid. How does that work when you used to take Sabrina when she was like a little girl?

[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:00.860]
How does that work when you like, uh, go to an event up to a certain age.

[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:04.420]
You don't have to buy a ticket for them if they're not going to occupy a seat.

[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:06.660]
If they're going to be sitting in the back, they sit in your lap.

[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:07.340]
They get in the front.

[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:10.360]
Up to a certain age like a very, very little tiny kids.

[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:13.160]
They're like, I don't know two, three years old, a little kid, three or four.

[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.940]
I forget what the cutoff point is.

[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.020]
It's a per place.

[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:20.160]
Everybody has their own set of rules about who you have to buy a ticket.

[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:23.580]
So in other words, you can bring in all the punky little kids and hold them up in the air and, uh,

[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.540]
poop all over what, uh, it's not in a kid's are bad, by the way.

[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:29.220]
These are not rowdy crying and then nothing wrong with the kids.

[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.040]
These kids are pretty well behaved, we're like little kids.

[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.320]
It's the parents that need to be slapped around a little bit.

[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:40.740]
We have two open lines in date, five six seven, oh five, 60,

[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:43.000]
five, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.060]
Here's a mobile and pompano. Hello.

[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.720]
Neil. Yes, sir.

[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:50.580]
Just came back from St. Louis and went to a hockey game.

[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.760]
St. Louis and Detroit.

[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:52.920]
What a great game.

[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:54.020]
St. Louis, right?

[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:54.320]
Game.

[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:56.340]
Oh, what is it?

[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.800]
What game did you go to because they tied?

[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.420]
No, that no last Saturday night.

[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:00.980]
Oh, I see.

[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:01.660]
You have St. Louis one.

[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:02.360]
Yeah.

[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.080]
And the fans are unbelievable.

[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:05.720]
The buschers were incredible.

[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:08.980]
I mean, you don't even have a chance to go to your seat unless there's no action.

[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:09.440]
Right.

[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.800]
And another thing I want to say all.

[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.020]
Here's up there at the Macarena.

[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.400]
You're doing a piss poor job.

[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:14.840]
Okay.

[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.120]
You're doing a crappy job.

[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.840]
You're letting people stand around in the aisles and block everybody's view.

[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:22.060]
While you're busy up there playing grab ass with the security cops up there.

[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.980]
I'm going to stick my guy with a fanny pack on him.

[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:26.420]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:27.760]
Another thing.

[01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:30.080]
I'm down here in Hollywood on federal highway.

[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:30.520]
Yeah.

[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:35.200]
These jackass and 80-in-tours drive so bad I just want to run it.

[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:36.520]
Yeah, I will go ahead.

[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:37.480]
Of course, they don't care.

[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.640]
They got those crappy old cars.

[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.160]
They don't care.

[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.000]
I don't think they know what the gas pedals for.

[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:42.340]

[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:44.200]
Can I call someone to do some back?

[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:44.880]
They know their gas.

[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:45.700]
Now go ahead.

[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.260]
Dave, the interior guy.

[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:48.400]
You are a douchebag.

[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:48.780]
Okay.

[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:49.060]

[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.260]
Watch out for his interior.

[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:50.620]
Okay.

[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.000]
See you.

[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:53.520]
We have an open line of day one and Broward.

[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.640]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:57.760]
By the way, our poll question today.

[01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.620]
Did anybody ever hear of an African Canadian?

[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:01.980]
Anybody ever heard that?

[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:02.240]
No.

[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:04.820]
Because Peter will rail speaking in by the way.

[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:05.560]
He's Canadian.

[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.820]
Very articulate guy.

[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:09.040]
We had Kevin Weeks on the team for a while there.

[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.400]
The goalie who wanted too much money, we said,

[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:10.820]
bye bye.

[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.900]
And he was like the Hameen or something.

[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:13.800]
Very articulate.

[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.240]
Let's spoke kind of like with the British accent.

[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.700]
Very bright guy.

[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:19.640]
And this goes back to what I was talking about yesterday.

[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.300]
And we had these calls from guys,

[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.520]
oh, well, I'm an African American.

[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:24.040]
I hate to break the news to you.

[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.300]
I don't want to burst your bubble.

[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:30.820]
I know you've been propagandized by the white bureaucracy

[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.080]
here in America.

[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:36.060]
But the fact is, there is no such thing as an African American.

[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:40.220]
Any more than I'm a Polish American or a Russian American,

[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.500]
because my ancestors, a couple of generations ago,

[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:43.460]
may have come from those countries.

[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.160]
And then like there's no such thing as an African Canadian.

[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:49.500]
You'd never, you'd be laughed off the streets if you said that up there.

[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.460]
Used to be a black Negro.

[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:54.280]
Then it was black.

[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:55.140]
Black wasn't good enough.

[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:56.600]
Then, oh, well, you're an African American.

[01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.000]
And then, of course, that engendered all of these African names.

[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.520]
And like I said, the white majority loves to continue doing this to black people

[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.200]
because it makes them think that they're really,

[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:07.820]
and instead of being part of the mainstream,

[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.240]
and if you can be a part of the mainstream,

[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.080]
and still have your own cultural things,

[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:15.460]
like Italians in America,

[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.080]
they still eat plenty of pasta,

[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:20.080]
and they still go back to the old country if they can,

[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:23.200]
and then they still have holidays that they may celebrate,

[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:26.340]
like Gwendo's birthday or whatever the holiday is.

[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:26.500]

[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.640]
So it's like the lettuce pickers down in South-Aid.

[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:33.860]
You know, they may celebrate Cinco de Mayo, right?

[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:35.340]
All ten of them.

[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:37.800]
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.860]
You can have an ethnic festival,

[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:43.140]
but this idea that there's some cultural difference between blacks and whites is unacceptable.

[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.480]
It's a propaganda, it's bullcrap.

[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:47.620]
It's a bunch of, that's right.

[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:51.860]
That's being foisted over on black America to keep black people in their place.

[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.460]
And, you know, and I'm the one that's going to say it,

[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.660]
but you white people out there,

[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:59.160]
you're not going to admit that you like seeing a big black guy out there

[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.520]
getting into fights and beating the crap out of everybody else.

[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.920]
That's what that Peter Ralph phenomenon's all about.

[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.580]
Ben Cotes, get away from the ball, mother f***ing thing.

[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.920]
That's right, that's what it's all about.

[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:12.960]
And you just don't have the balls, you don't have the co-hones to come on here

[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.740]
and tell it and express the way you really feel about it.

[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.880]
Because you're hypocrites.

[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:19.380]
You're a bunch of goddamn limousine liberals is what you are.

[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.600]
Watch a horseball phoneies, man.

[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:27.060]
And guys go out there and they do a good job for you to do a great job.

[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.780]
And you sit on your hand, oh, who's that?

[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.400]
Yeah, he's okay, he's putting on you.

[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.300]
Man, don't ever expect, it's like this thing with a center one, a fundraiser.

[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:38.560]
I've been telling you, I've been really mean to this and I learned it years ago.

[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.840]
Don't ever do anything in this time expecting you get credit for it or pat on the back

[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.100]
because it's highly unlikely that will ever occur.

[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:49.920]
It's 1126, it's 560 WQAM.

[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.320]
This is 560, QAM.

[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:55.780]
It's state!

[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:57.700]
In Miami town,

[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.700]
it's 560 WQAM.

[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.440]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.960]
It mixes it all up.

[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.200]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:15.580]
It puts them both together.

[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.840]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.360]
When the eyeball falls out, it puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.100]
But it has to hold it out.

[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.600]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.160]
It's what I have to get.

[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:29.240]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.000]
It needs to rub it on my brain.

[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:32.780]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:38.180]
I have to dry clean my skin so it can put the lotion in the basket.

[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.000]
I said, dog, dog!

[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:43.960]
I switched my baby in my legs, I said, dog, dog!

[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:46.120]
I like to dance around this way.

[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:51.600]
For me, for the lovesquate today, I said, for me,

[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:53.920]
I want to look for like a wolf.

[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.460]
My name is Pablo Bill.

[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.780]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.220]
It makes it more basket.

[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.520]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:05.360]
I hold my PPE and it puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:06.720]
How much does it grow?

[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:08.740]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.140]
I got my skin so it's going to go like this.

[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:24.180]
I'm going to put the lotion in the basket.

[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:24.180]

[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:25.720]
I'm going to put the lotion in the basket.

[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.200]
I'm going to put the lotion in the basket.

[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:35.160]
By the way, what's the number one thing you can think about American like culture?

[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:37.980]
It's 11.31 at 5.60 W to QM.

[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.880]
Oh, and that lady, I was just going to go to Rinchie Hangup.

[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.740]
I was just going to put her on and she had disappeared.

[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:42.780]
I only like that bitch, huh?

[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:47.220]
Open line and date with that bitch just hung up 5.67.05.60.

[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.320]
I only saw that tweet heart.

[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.780]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:52.100]
Hello.

[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:53.420]
New York.

[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:53.880]
Happy New York.

[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:54.580]
And say me, sir.

[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.260]
Oh, hopefully.

[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.920]
I love the pants as I love going to the games.

[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:00.580]
I can't follow it to music anymore.

[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:01.700]
Yeah, it's loud.

[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.260]
Not as worse.

[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:05.820]
It's not as bad as it was in the beginning, but it's still annoying.

[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.000]
And you know something, they never give you a breather.

[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:12.900]
In other words, as soon as one thing stops, they start something else.

[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:16.820]
They never give you like 30 seconds to kind of lay your eardrums roll back into place

[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.200]
and get your brain unscramble.

[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:19.440]
They never give you a breath.

[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:19.600]
Yes.

[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:21.060]
I know.

[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:21.900]
It really sucks.

[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:23.340]
I wish there was something that could do about it.

[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.420]
I think it's louder now than it was in the beginning.

[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:25.700]
No.

[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:26.180]
No.

[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.560]
I'm sitting closer to the ice now.

[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.420]
So maybe it's re-bubbering off the ice or so.

[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.500]
It's just a thing about the Peter O'Rourrell.

[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.800]
I guess my own philosophy on it is.

[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.640]
It's one of the few places where you can go to watch a black guy beat the crap out of a white guy.

[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:42.340]
And his sentence is five minutes.

[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:43.500]
Mm-hmm.

[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.060]
I mean, I don't know what else I could think.

[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:46.680]
Is there one cheer?

[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:47.300]
Is there one of these?

[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.840]
Well, nobody will tell me.

[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:50.880]
I mean, you were there last night?

[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:51.360]
Yeah.

[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:57.500]
Okay, and you saw the psychotic, the hysterical reaction with this guy who does absolutely nothing.

[01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:58.260]
He can't skate.

[01:14:58.540 --> 01:14:59.220]
He can't pass.

[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:00.540]
He certainly ain't going to score any goals.

[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.040]
And the reaction to him would be like the savior just came out of the clouds.

[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.280]
It was weird.

[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:09.580]
What I didn't see was what promoted.

[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:10.260]
Because I'm watching.

[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:12.800]
I just looked like he tore off on a guy.

[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:13.560]
I couldn't hide it and see.

[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.480]
Yeah, he was behind the bone.

[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.440]
Okay, your phone is crapping out.

[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.540]
It was right in front of me.

[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:21.000]
And he elbowed the guy through your four times and precipitated a fight.

[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:22.800]
And you know, that's what they wanted to see.

[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.820]
But I mean, the reaction.

[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.760]
And Peter, Peter, these are comes back here.

[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:27.260]
They're bull in them.

[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.160]
This guy who can't play the game worth of crafts.

[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:31.580]
They were cheering him like he did the second and third coming.

[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:32.000]
Okay?

[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:33.540]
Squirt, squirt.

[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:35.040]
We have an open line and Dave won him part.

[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:38.500]
Have we still heard from any of those 18, those 99% of the people?

[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:38.720]
No.

[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.280]
Of course not.

[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:43.620]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and 05, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.040]
Spinalist jellyfish.

[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:47.920]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:48.180]
Hello.

[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.780]
How about Trit, the hair helmet lot.

[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:55.000]
Denying that he had spoken to the white guy.

[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:55.560]
Okay, great.

[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:58.160]
Okay, we have two open lines and Broward in one and Dave.

[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:01.920]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60 and Pomp 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.540]
Here's a mobile in Miami Beach. Hello.

[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:05.780]
Hello Neil.

[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:06.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:07.240]
Hey, how are you?

[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.520]
Please bear with me.

[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.400]
I have a little bit of a cold.

[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:10.440]
But nevertheless, yes.

[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:16.320]
But nevertheless, hey, I just returned from Europe with my wife first time there.

[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:20.340]
We started in Paris, which I either stand.

[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:22.420]
I, exactly.

[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:22.740]
Yeah.

[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.520]
Although we liked it.

[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.340]
But then again, it was our first time.

[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:26.960]
We're impressed.

[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.820]
And then we went to Spain hoping to go to Italy next time.

[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:33.620]
But with Spain had a marvelous time.

[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.480]
Where did you want Spain?

[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:35.280]
We went to Barcelona.

[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.000]
Or Barcelona.

[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.340]
We went to Seville.

[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:38.380]
How was Barcelona?

[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:40.940]
Barcelona is beautiful right on the Mediterranean.

[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:45.760]
We had a great weather, great food, great drink.

[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:49.500]
But more importantly, the people are human beings.

[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:49.780]

[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.380]
I mean, just people are friendly.

[01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:54.080]
Everybody talks, see, I want to Madrid.

[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:55.820]
And that was a ban in Paris in Spain.

[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.460]
Everybody says you should never have gone to Madrid.

[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.760]
Because it's like going to Domino Park, you know, a bunch of crusty old spics.

[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:01.880]
You should have gone to Barcelona.

[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:02.680]
It's what they say.

[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:04.660]
Well, we went to Madrid also.

[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:06.080]
And we enjoyed it.

[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:12.500]
We enjoyed the sight trips more than Madrid itself.

[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.260]
We went to Toledo, to Góvia.

[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.080]
But I have to tell you, just the lifestyle is incredible.

[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:19.480]
Different world.

[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:20.720]
It's a different world, you know.

[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.600]
Different world, different priorities, different attitudes.

[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:27.060]
And the landscape is not full of neon lights.

[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:28.700]
Right, no strip shopping malls.

[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:29.120]
There you go.

[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:29.780]
Oh, man.

[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:29.960]

[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:31.560]
Amazing.

[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:33.340]
Most dog rascals outlet mall.

[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.120]
I just want to let you know that I got about you

[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.040]
because you are absolutely correct, sir.

[01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:38.660]
Well, wait till you get to Italy next time.

[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.140]
We will be going soon.

[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:41.320]
We will be going to the real world, is.

[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:42.340]
Okay, pal.

[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:44.360]
New year in Neil, bye-bye.

[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.020]
And back to you.

[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:49.040]
We have an open line of Dave 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:50.940]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless one.

[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:54.960]
Is I continue banging away, pounding away, begging, screaming, squeezing.

[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.480]
Will I get one call today from what I'm looking for?

[01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:57.640]
No.

[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:58.220]
Of course not.

[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:01.900]
Let's talk about the funky chicken and Merton hangs from the 49ers.

[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:02.900]
Okay, do you want to talk about that?

[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:03.180]
No.

[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:06.380]
So, again, I'm out there on the limb,

[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.520]
but I know what I'm saying is true.

[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:08.500]
I know what I'm talking about.

[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.440]
There are a lot of things, a lot of areas where I know nothing.

[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:11.760]
For example, finance.

[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:15.860]
I'm the worst, the worst person I could have made so much money in a stock market

[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:19.800]
in the last two, three months if I had any balls or brains that I have neither.

[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:20.860]
None.

[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.500]
You just, you know, you get into that panic back in October.

[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.380]
Oh, my God.

[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:29.040]
And you start realizing, hey, this is gambling, baby.

[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.000]
You've worked all your life to accumulate whatever money you got.

[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:32.920]
And it's gambling.

[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.960]
And you sit there and you look at IBM sitting there, it was down to like, what,

[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:38.700]
80, 90 bucks a share and out to 180.

[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000]
And you look at AOL and it's found to be 76 now to 158.

[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.660]
And these stocks are going up 20 and 30 and 40 points today.

[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:45.840]
It's gambling, baby.

[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:49.780]
So when it comes to that stuff, I know nothing.

[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:54.900]
I'm the kind of person quite frankly who'd be better off letting my money sit in the God damn a CD,

[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.120]
like the old Farts do.

[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.840]
Seriously, just accumulating whatever little interest I can get.

[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:00.780]
And not to play this other bull-crab game.

[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:03.560]
Because I don't know anything about it.

[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:07.220]
But when it comes to the things I'm talking about here today,

[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:12.120]
and what comes to this business of the, the jivest you can enjoy, and white America sitting back and saying,

[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:13.720]
look at that jivest nigger.

[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:14.820]
That's what they're saying.

[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.680]
That is what white America is saying with this crap.

[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:21.460]
And don't give me this bull-crab.

[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:23.700]
Oh, it's cool, man. It's cool. Yeah, right.

[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:24.660]
Cool is a frog.

[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:25.760]
Hard, okay?

[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:30.260]
The dirty bird and the funky chicken and the Jim berries of the world.

[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:33.040]
By the way, Jim Berg, it's sliced up greatness column, which I'll either read later.

[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.160]
Maybe I'll save it for tomorrow.

[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:35.720]
It's too good to gloss over.

[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:39.360]
Congratulations to Howard Beale, whoever you really are.

[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.720]
It's CityLink. Here's Mudden Urile.

[01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:43.780]
One of the great columns ever written in this town.

[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.880]
December 23rd, 98 issue of CityLink Magazine.

[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.600]
North Miami, hello.

[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:51.660]
Yes, Neil.

[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:52.160]
Yes, sir.

[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.840]
You the first person I've ever heard said that and you make so much sense.

[01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:57.400]
About what?

[01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:59.500]
About African-American.

[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.580]
There's no such thing.

[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:01.200]
I know.

[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:02.860]
And I've been through years.

[01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:03.820]
I'm black.

[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:07.080]
How many black guys do you know or black people who have born in Africa?

[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:07.740]
We're here now.

[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:08.200]
I know.

[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:10.360]
And this is what I've been telling my wife and for years.

[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.180]
I said listen, there's no such thing.

[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.720]
I say you are your background is German.

[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:16.500]
I don't hear you saying you're German-American.

[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:16.700]
Right.

[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.360]
So you know why should we have this?

[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:23.220]
This is just another way that the white establishment and other thing they've an invention of theirs

[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:28.040]
to create this, to perpetuate this division of the races in this country.

[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:29.220]
May you so right, me.

[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:31.640]
I like to say if you're Neil as a gold boy.

[01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:32.280]
Okay.

[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:32.740]
All right.

[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:33.480]
You go, Leroy.

[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:34.060]
All right.

[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:35.700]
Go white boy.

[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.440]
Go crack your boy.

[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:37.600]
Go, Jew boy.

[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:39.300]
We have an open line today.

[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.780]
Boy, how come we got a piece so bad?

[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.180]
Maybe it's because I'm breaking 20 or 30 of these diet sodas here today.

[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:43.720]
That could be it.

[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.240]
I'm going to start peeing in the cup, I think.

[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:46.240]
No, seriously.

[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.900]
It's too long to walk down a hallway.

[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:52.840]
And by the way, when we do, if and when we finally do get up on the third floor there,

[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:56.620]
and we get the whole QA, I'm still going to come down here and use the TV down here.

[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:58.960]
What are you laughing about?

[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.280]
That light saw was expensive, man.

[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:05.740]
You think I'm going to use the same toilet seat upstairs as some of those people over there using?

[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:07.320]
I don't want to mention no names.

[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.760]
Oh, the old way Jose.

[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:10.940]
Oh, I'll leave him out.

[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:12.740]
Here's the Helen Dale.

[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:13.000]
Hello.

[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:13.780]
Hey, Neil.

[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:14.300]
Yes.

[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.820]
This is a live one.

[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:19.100]
So I'm from Helen Dale.

[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:19.460]
Yeah.

[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:20.780]
Not an old dead fishback.

[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:22.400]
I want to ask you a question.

[01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:24.680]
It's not like somebody in Helen Dale.

[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.720]
Oh, come on.

[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:27.280]
Yeah, listen.

[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:28.240]
Get with it.

[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.280]
I want to ask you a question.

[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.180]
And a voice like that, you're telling me to get with it.

[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.520]
It's not like, you'll do it on the hill.

[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:34.500]
Let me ask you a question.

[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:34.720]
Yeah.

[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:39.800]
First of all, do you know that the Brian Craig is going to run for mayor of plantation?

[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:40.560]
Well, guess what?

[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:41.060]
We don't care.

[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:41.320]
Okay.

[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.520]
See, there is a hint in Helen Dale.

[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:43.760]
We don't care about Brian Craig.

[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.600]
We don't care about WFTL.

[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.240]
We don't care about whatever that station is.

[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.260]
That's, uh, Mr. Egos.

[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.560]
We don't care about that stuff.

[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:49.960]
Okay.

[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.780]
All I can say to you is, it's a dead one in Helen Dale.

[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:55.040]
It's a real live one.

[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.580]
It sounds like an old Yentit to me.

[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:58.260]
You sound like an old Yentit sweet art.

[01:21:58.640 --> 01:21:58.740]
Okay.

[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:01.760]
Go give Sonny Rosenberg a big kiss on his fat pimply.

[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:02.140]
Correct him.

[01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:03.000]
Get out of our face.

[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:05.000]
We're talking important stuff here today.

[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:10.400]
I mean, there are poll questions today is, and I've asked this before, but you won't respond

[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:10.700]
to it.

[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.740]
Who do you admire most on the Florida Panthers?

[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:13.760]
The Spark plug.

[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.380]
We know who he is, number 14 or the Schwartz plug, number 28, which is twice.

[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:20.360]
I guess he's twice the player because twice time 14 is 28.

[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:21.660]
Does that make any sense to you?

[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:22.500]
Well, there you go.

[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.260]
He don't get twice the reaction.

[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:29.660]
He gets 50 times the reaction because I'm not sure why because they like that big that haircut.

[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.060]
That must be it.

[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:37.640]
20 minutes till noon at 560 WQM got Hank coming up from the sporting brews from 2 to 6.

[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:38.460]
We got Kimba.

[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:40.020]
It's not Hank.

[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:41.180]
It's Kimba.

[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:43.640]
What do you mean by that?

[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:45.260]
My schedule does not say that.

[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:48.660]
Well, I forgot to put the new one up there or I wasn't here or something happened.

[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:50.880]
Do you mean the Humper is not going to be on today?

[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:51.980]
Yeah.

[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:54.840]
What was he today?

[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.480]
He was talking yesterday about maybe going to Vegas for New Year's.

[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.060]
We're sticking him out of boxing.

[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:01.240]
That's super playoff game here.

[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.460]
If I was him, I'd be in Vegas.

[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:03.600]
And what is it?

[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:05.260]
Kimba's on a two and then one.

[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:08.980]
And well, whatever was done after that, we got the big goddamn.

[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:10.180]
What is it again?

[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:12.980]
The micron PC, pool and weed whackers.

[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:15.740]
Stick it where the moon don't shine in your rectum bowl tonight.

[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.080]
730 here on QAM.

[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.880]
This is 560 QAM.

[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:22.220]
New York, God.

[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:31.860]
Oh, here's where the trouble goes.

[01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:33.520]
This red to here.

[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.200]
Now look what you're doing.

[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:37.700]
Oh, that's what we're saying.

[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:39.780]
Dress, dress, dress, dress.

[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:40.700]
That's what we're saying.

[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:41.620]
Dress, arm.

[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:44.180]
Oh, come on, this is the same.

[01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:45.980]
Dress, dress, dress, dress.

[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:47.880]
Dress, wrestler, this is the Dress, arm.

[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.920]
Yeah, it gets fine, it gets worse, worse, come.

[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.100]
She's saving the dress like a low-life skull.

[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:56.820]
It smells like you can do.

[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:58.280]
Where's the beret for a hat?

[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:00.000]
Where's the side 14, too?

[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.700]
God, she's so gasped in, man.

[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.400]
God, the shit that bread is.

[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:07.760]
She come back and brag, but she could come on my plane just the way I like.

[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.540]
That's what we're saying.

[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:11.500]
Dress, dress, dress, dress.

[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:12.580]
That's what we're saying.

[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.840]
Oh, that's what we're saying.

[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:17.660]
That's what we're saying.

[01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:17.660]

[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:21.160]
Because I literally not get to it.

[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.260]
That's what we're saying.

[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:24.240]
Dress, dress, dress, dress.

[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.080]
Dress, wrestler, this is Dress, arm.

[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:30.440]
Dress, wrestler, this is Dress, dress, dress.

[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:30.980]
Dress, dress, dress, dress.

Dress, dress, dress, dress, dress.

[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:36.560]
Number 44, 560 WDQM, I've got to spectacular.

[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:37.480]
Did you look at this?

[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:38.680]
Yes.

[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.160]
Did you take a puke at this?

[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.020]
We just got facts to once the latest

[01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:47.080]
up to the minute totals on our center one campaign which officially ends in two

[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.060]
days on the thirty first

[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.980]
and is basically a pretty much a company at the end of the run

[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:55.460]
hundred and thirty eight thousand eight hundred and twenty six bucks

[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:58.300]
out of the clue what did i give it this morning from last night of the game

[01:24:58.300 --> 01:24:59.580]
a hundred and ten

[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:00.000]
right

[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:03.820]
but this envelope got all kinds of stuff in it that i'm sure it's not totaled on

[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:03.980]
there

[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.760]
also not which he has no way of knowing that

[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:13.400]
why don't you want to give me the add that up okay my work asking around here

[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:16.240]
and guarantee you were like right up there about a hundred and forty grand

[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:20.040]
now it's interesting the most we ever rate for a center one before two years ago

[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.440]
and this was on the old w i

[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:25.200]
we raise the hundred and forty grand

[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.400]
and that was with the best of fill which sold a course like hotcakes and the best

[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.760]
in the old two volumes and the best of the contours which uh... and uh... whatever

[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:35.680]
else we had the t-shirts and all those multiple appearances by all the

[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.400]
different people

[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:41.240]
and so like about you know a few weeks ago there was a lot of you know we

[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:44.300]
understand from carol the most ever got for some was a hundred and forty so

[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:46.740]
if you do like seventy or eighty all by yourself that's pretty good

[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:51.600]
and i said i don't want to do it all by myself okay i've been doing all by

[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.460]
myself for much of my life i'd rather do it with somebody else and i

[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:54.940]
assistance

[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:56.320]
six seventy six

[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:02.140]
six seventy six that means two and zero and five

[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:06.840]
a hundred and thirty nine thousand five hundred and two dollars

[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:13.560]
which means we need four hundred and ninety eight dollars by the close up tomorrow

[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:19.920]
to reach a hundred and forty grand like falling off a log like four i bet you

[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.180]

[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:46.700]
four hundred and ninety eight bucks more to reach a hundred and forty grand

[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:49.460]
always know to shandah we don't have like somebody around because it is the

[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:51.320]
holidays naturally there ain't nobody around here

[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:55.420]
wouldn't be great if we had the qa and van or could then sam or christ or somebody

[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:56.560]
out like on a street corner

[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:57.360]
huh

[01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:01.080]
in the next two hours in the thirteen minutes of the cut get up to a hundred

[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.860]
and forty grand total today that would make me feel like it was worth coming

[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:04.300]
in today

[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:11.020]
two open lines in date county five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the

[01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:13.800]
eighteen t-warves and by the way did you you didn't look at the individual

[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.080]
stores or did you the borders

[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:19.240]
you're never gonna guess which store had the biggest total last week christmas

[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:19.680]
week

[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:21.820]
no wrong

[01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:22.720]
uh...

[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:27.620]
bokeh and f-fac it wasn't day

[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:30.900]
the top two locations were in date and they were in

[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:32.720]
they were in palm beach

[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.800]
bokeh did twenty nine hundred fifty five bucks and point in beach was number one

[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:39.940]
with thirty one hundred sixty bucks

[01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:41.700]
last week how do you like that

[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.980]
i mean i've included pretty good twenty one forty candle eighteen eighty

[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:50.500]
and look at the growth of the only one thought i see in other words we probably

[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.340]
are already over a hundred and four well probably not

[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:53.980]
because coconut grove here is blank

[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:00.380]
we didn't do squat in the grove we didn't even go and and do a squat in the

[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:04.520]
grove no we didn't do that week after week i look on these lists and the

[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:07.460]
effect what's the uh... yeah the grove is missing the week before it's a blank

[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:12.100]
five hundred and sixty bucks here the week before that forty bucks there

[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:14.320]
that was we did nothing in the grove

[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:17.340]
because basically i mean what you got in the grove you got a bunch of fags

[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:20.460]
and suppose down here okay i thought we had lots of fags and suppose but

[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:24.200]
i guess our fags and suppose do not listen to live in the grove

[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.020]
that's the depressing that's unbelievable

[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:32.380]
so we are gigantic up there in palm beach county how do you like that

[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:35.320]
we only had a line for them although we do have that nine three or three

[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.800]
thousand but we never said because we're too cheap to say it

[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:45.120]

candle hello hey i'll go nail yes sir um you know what i'm i'm a dolphin fan but i've

[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:29.780]
really pulled back why interest johnson took over

[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:35.220]
and uh i just barely lucky a paper watch the occasional game now really

[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:39.880]
but i don't i'm not interested in football other than the dolphin is even then that's

[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:45.260]
losing its power but i never heard of the dirty bird prior to

[01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:50.420]
the game the other day the Atlantic and then all they said the dirty bird this and then

[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:55.440]
and then you know there i guess there's a player tyrell bucle who's been there for a while

[01:30:56.020 --> 01:31:00.780]
now his nickname is keep up i know everybody everybody has to be having a nickname

[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:05.820]
where that came from but you know i'm always amazed i never heard of stupid dirty bird could care

[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:10.360]
less about also that's a big thing on our local media now the dirty bird yeah like uh

[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:13.980]
huh look at the crap you know nobody that's right but you know what i know you because

[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:19.440]
let me you several times i know you call other than when you talk somewhat you know whatever

[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:25.480]
about the uh black you say spartus i've always preferred to turn former Nigerians myself because

[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:30.180]
they're not black americans i mean they're not African-Americans they're former Nigerian

[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:34.380]
well what meaning what what is that well that's the main reason they came from when they were

[01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:39.580]
you know captured by their fellow Africans and sold to the white man yeah that's a problem they'll

[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:44.080]
never want to do well let me ask you this seriously why can't people just be american exactly i

[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.980]
have no problem with that you know i agree with you why don't you have to have hyphenated what

[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:50.780]
have to have human-Americans and Italian-Americans and African-Americans exactly you know i mean

[01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:55.000]
to prop again it's bullcrap there's no such thing exactly because now you you hit it on the head

[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.180]
but you miss the brain except because now we have the African-American where we've had the African

[01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:02.500]
-Americans for a while but now we all have to say that's literally correct thing during the holiday

[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:08.380]
we don't happy quan no we don't no i know i know i don't i know you don't but i was saying that's

[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:13.840]

[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:46.000]
to Ben Johnson ever say oh i'm a uh African-Canadian no it's ridiculous it's laughable

[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:52.180]
the hyphenated-Americans all the better to keep you know separating them and you know divide

[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:55.700]
in conquer divide in conquer divide in conquer that's what it's all about that's what they

[01:32:55.700 --> 01:33:01.580]
white the lily white establishment loves compartmentalized divide in conquer just be a god then

[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:06.380]
american okay we're not interested where you got them grand the mother came from in quinta quente

[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:10.160]
we're not interested in you know anna salam and we don't care about all those old bubble mice

[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:16.560]
these okay cut to the chase and stop this bull crab oh with a deep part about culture and let me

[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:21.920]
say it again let me say it one more time very clearly i travel all over the world i see people of

[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:27.080]
color in other parts of the world who speak perfect english just as i am speaking to you right now

[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:32.240]
just as ed Bradley speaks it and just as Julian von speaks it and just as barber Jordan used to be

[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:38.320]
speaking it before she be dead okay so stop giving me this crap about it's a cultural thing or an

[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:42.960]
ethnic thing it's an american butchered propaganda to keep a lot of people on the end on the bottom

[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:47.020]
rung of the totem pole to keep black people under white people's thumbs that's what it's all about

[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:51.280]
and those of you brothers and sisters out there that get sucked into this bull crab and you believe

[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:59.460]
it's shame on you embarrassing just like all this with the african names now oh man that's

[01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:02.960]
that's a great way to become a part of the mainstream oh we know a lot of it come up well why not

[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:08.920]
why not i mean you know we can only open up so many mcdonalds and burger kings and the NBA

[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.800]
franchise is ain't doing too good right now either

[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:18.720]
get a brain get a brain and start resisting all of this bull crab to come part metalized

[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:22.260]
and teach you that you're somehow you know different because your skin is a different color

[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:29.480]

the two and twelve fl team yeah and that is shame you lost your happy team i mean that was such a

[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:17.880]
great thing that you would be all white with a pom poms and you know it's for me to desperate

[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:54.060]

[01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:58.660]
because i've always got some change in my pocket why i stop it i'm chief i'm not very far from being

[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:05.080]
chief but it's just i think it's a psychological thing you feel that if you do it the first time

[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:09.860]
that every and then it got so many homeless people up there in Toronto that's one of the

[01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:13.500]
greatest cities in the world is Toronto in fact when they do these surveys they rate the various

[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:20.900]
cities but the one disgrace the one shame that they have are the homeless people and especially

[01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:26.040]
this time of year it starts getting really really cold and nasty and freezing i mean so many

[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:31.140]

Bokamper is going to be on 2 o'clock this afternoon. He doesn't take no crap from anybody. He's a good American with no hyphen in the middle.

[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:43.060]
Open line of days 5 6 7 0 5 60. So here we are. We've got on the year for over a little over two hours now. Have I had one?

[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:50.280]
I mean, I realized a month through a whole bunch of other crap there in the beginning, but if I had one call from one of those 80 or 90% of the

[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:54.540]
Know-Nothings there in that Macarena who are obsessed with a big black guy named Pete. No.

[01:38:55.020 --> 01:39:01.480]
One call that were explained to the rest of us, well, I guess are too slow, too stupid, or whatever it is to understand what the big attraction is there.

[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:01.680]
No.

[01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:08.540]
Doesn't that speak for itself? Yeah, I think that speaks for itself.

[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:16.680]
Here's a mobile in 4-later day. Hello. Hey, Neil. How's it going? Great. Happy New Year. Happy Halloween.

[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:24.980]
I don't go very many hockey games. Don't get an opportunity to little expensive formies.

[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:32.980]
Little high-priced right? Yeah. I am a season ticket holder for the dolphins. It's basically the same because they want you to cheer on defense.

[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:41.720]
When it teams on defense, it disrupts the other team's offense. But these same assholes start doing the wave when the offense is on.

[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:11.700]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

they ought to be smoking but we can't we can't extract even a little bit of honesty out of the

[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:29.440]
so-called fan this is the supposed to be a sports station which thank god for me that usually i

[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:33.700]
give a little bit of a breath of fresh air from that for four hours a day a chance to uh have a

[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:40.800]
mental animal from all that swill but on your supposed sports station every time we play this it's

[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:46.700]
like a heightened seat game can't find those panther fans nowhere know how even though every god damn

one of them is out there listed right now every one of your list them am i right yes god damn it

[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:03.200]
nine minutes afternoon if i what what's the point why do i keep doing this

[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:07.220]
why do i keep getting all worked up to a frenzy when i know they're not going to respond

[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:12.520]
on how can somebody respond to you when they have nothing to back up what they're going to say

[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:16.520]
i'll give an example i was in k-Mart yesterday doing that thing for the toilet seat you know

[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:22.080]
wasting my time and i get this all the time i mean i go into like public so i go into k-Mart

[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:27.260]
and there are people you see them do like a double take and they'll turn around and you realize

[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:31.520]
that they recognize you okay well they can say hey me oh how are and i always am friendly how

[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:38.280]
you doing nice to see i love your show whatever 15 seconds tops so i'm in k-Mart yesterday i'm

[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:44.220]
walking the wandering around looking for where the god damn toilet seat place is and here's a guy

[01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:49.580]
in his i would say 60s with his wife and he does does the same thing looks like you know and she

[01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:52.940]
says and you can tell he said or oh that's in the arrived and he said well why don't you say hello

[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:56.640]
to him well i'm already like you know 20 yards up the thing there you know

[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:04.320]
here's a guy in in a k-Mart he doesn't have the balls just to say hi and he'll how are you

[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:09.460]
is that man ever gonna call this show no i mean are you kidding me

[01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:13.180]
he doesn't have the balls just to say hello

[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:22.100]
much less to call this show and take on yeah good or even just have a you know a civilized

[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:25.520]
conversation and say happy new year he doesn't have the cahons for that

[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:32.400]

five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty uh this is the whole thing though you've heard of

[01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:38.520]
the phantom of the opera it's the phantom of the of panther fans because there aren't any they're

[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:43.300]
like a smattering of it the rest of the people are just bodies in a seat that's all with all their

[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:47.400]
panther jerseys on and their paraphernalia which wein like so lot because you make it a lot of money

[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:54.460]
keep it up here's a mobile in north mind me beach hello hey how you doing yeah great uh

[01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:59.820]
couple things uh i guess people like peter warl only because he is a fighter honestly i'm just

[01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:03.420]
trying to understand what's going on the league did they send out a letter or all the teams that

[01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:07.580]
they have to have a token on each team we are paul laws is the fighter on the team i mean what do

[01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:11.200]
we need to know what i say it's okay if you notice an elite that there's one black player like on

[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:16.620]
each team like buffalo who's the black player who's the black player on Toronto well i'm not every team

[01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:21.220]
but i've noticed the black player on Detroit you don't mean on a bunch of teams but the point is you

[01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:26.460]
notice that you're slowly seeing one on a team yeah and i'm just trying to know what what

[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:30.860]
difference does that not any good no no you're wrong about that my career is a very good player on

[01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:34.520]
Edmonton right here has been in the league for many many years he's still one of the best

[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:39.140]
coolies in league for saying Lewis yeah but he's how about Anton Carter he's a hell of a good player

[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:44.040]
how much how many black players can you name for me who are in the league who aren't good players

[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:48.920]
besides peter warl what about the guy on Boston why can't remember his name

[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:55.100]
Anton Carter's not a good player he's fair he's fair he's one of the better young players in the

[01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:58.980]
league get out of here go back to your plan me go get your pointed hooting get out of here

[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:04.240]
all the way does have a point you know i've said this for the last several years and we're serious

[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:08.680]
you black folks are taking all the other sports away and that's fine you know we can deal with it

[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:15.800]
especially like the NBA you know have a good time sitting on the sidelines but leave hockey

[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:22.240]
for us white people okay we got to have something leave hockey to the white people we don't mind a few

[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:27.340]
token sparches in there like i said i apologize the last guy at a good point but he is wrong about

[01:54:27.340 --> 01:54:31.000]
Anton Carter he's a real good player and so is my career and so is grandfuel and is a and

[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.760]
Donald Rocher I can take him or leave him he's a fighter buddy but let's see there's a difference

[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:41.960]
between being a fighter being a goon and just being a uh and a player who can fight like ty dolmy

[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:48.260]
there's a little player there's a guy's got three goals seven assists he's got ten points he

[01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:53.880]
can skate he's a player he's got some skills and by the way they just took a survey in a hockey news

[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:57.820]
all that the other players in league vote ty dolmy is the best fighter in a league okay

[01:54:57.820 --> 01:55:01.720]
he always like a little midget guy and comes up to their perfect he still knocks the crap out of

[01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:11.620]
most of the time here's a mobile intel raid b chillo okay nice talking to you too

[01:55:11.620 --> 01:55:16.500]
load out your ass up there in delray with all you old parts five six seven oh five sixty and

[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:21.520]
pound five sixty on the mobile one line here's mimey lake hello hey do you know how i

[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:28.780]
great uh two quick things uh first i more than glad to say that i donated a hundred dollars to

[01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:34.740]
uh center one thank you uh last week when i called i asked George for the phone number and uh

[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:40.100]
also heard it over the years so and i had a couple of friends i had the phone number and

[01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:44.040]
go ahead and made it a hundred dollars not too much but so like in a four-year

[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:49.360]
all that's thank you we appreciate uh second thing uh did you get the toilet business fixed

[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:54.020]
no i got to go to home people i went to a came art okay good to come on they still need like a

[01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:59.600]
baby toilet seat right yeah because i had the same problem with the toilet and uh i bought one

[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:04.420]
phone came art as a matter of fact no excuse me my mistake i bought a phone Walmart a Walmart

[01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:09.940]
oh boy i bought a phone Walmart and i had a small accident small big accident

[01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:16.180]
so yeah i put it on and uh i fell right through them right in the

[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:19.800]
right in the middle of the back but you know something i'm thinking now this may sound

[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:23.460]
grotesque when you come right down to it who really needs a toilet seat you know

[01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:28.580]
why are you looking at me like that why do you look at me with a look that would kill

[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:33.980]
maybe you wouldn't fall right but no you're well you're a little spick okay you would fall

[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:39.100]
right in i got a big fat ass i'm a big fat old you okay i probably could like a and you know

[01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:43.380]
something that would be more like the european style toilet seats which allow for a much easier

[01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:47.320]
more relaxed right because they're they're more contoured to the body they're like wider

[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:54.880]
that porcelain's really cold how and now how about if you heat it huh keep

[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:58.480]
them buying a two hundred dollar toilet seat or whatever you're talking about yeah George is

[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:02.820]

[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:17.980]
i mean i know it's the middle of lunch i don't want to start talking about splitter and splatter

[01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:26.260]
and stuff like that spittle and splatter but trust me what i tell you no uh no fabric toilet seats

[01:57:26.260 --> 01:57:32.560]

[01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:50.240]
accidents we got one making all this freeway here what's they know how to drive that's because they

[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:53.620]
drive with their directionals they put their blinker on and if somebody wants to get in the

[01:57:53.620 --> 01:57:57.560]
lane you let them in and they all drive that way because they know how to drive uh this here

[01:57:57.560 --> 01:58:03.580]
every day we got to uh it isn't just that it's the uh tankers and the truck drivers

[01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:08.400]

wait out there and set there for the whole weekend no accidents sir i'm gonna tell you go to

[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:19.660]
any really big city like the troids okay the troid has got a great expressway system they drive

[01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:23.980]
like a bad out of hell they all know how to drive well you'll see maybe a tenth of the accidents

[01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:28.280]
their percentage wise as you'll see here they they know what they're doing and they don't sit

[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:32.900]
there and drive with their break they drive with the accelerator when when the light changes to green

[01:58:32.900 --> 01:58:37.540]
you can step on the gas even if you're the tenth person in line because everybody else is stepping

[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:41.460]
on the gas here if you're ten people back you know you're gonna have to wait like two three lights

[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:45.800]
because they're they're picking their nose oh well they're picking somewhere but they're picking

[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:51.740]

in the federal zone so of course this show you this is propaganda invented and perpetuated by the

[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:17.280]
blood by the white establishment and by Alex Haley who had a very anglicized name by the way I

[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:23.880]

dictionary right here he says he's the epitome of a hockey player okay we have an open-line in

[02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:06.420]
Howard five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixties on the that's epitome the user where we

[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:13.880]
going here's sunrise hello yes sir can't hear you yeah but I was in college in the mid-70s in Boston

[02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:20.980]
I knew a hockey center who labelled himself as an afro-canadian and what happened with him was he

[02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:25.580]
he wouldn't buy into the mill and stuff whenever it was afro-american so at the hockey games whenever

[02:06:25.580 --> 02:06:30.420]
each score we whip out a big banner that would say afro-canadian and he'd laugh like hell when he could

[02:06:30.420 --> 02:06:35.440]
keep a straight face where was this or at Eastern University his name was Wayne Turner huh he was a

[02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:40.340]
black center very talented from somehow post in Saskatoon and as a matter of fact he won

[02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:46.020]
and it was sister head he's going to win a go on the beanpot no time in his senior year but I was

[02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:50.780]
buying into it and his label was afro-canadian oh the beanpot tournament boy that's a great thing

[02:06:50.780 --> 02:06:54.440]
it's a great tournament yeah I miss him I can't imagine him having a beanpot tournament down here

[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:59.640]
no I get it I think we're all how's that you of them hockey team coming by the way no well see the

[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:03.840]

[02:07:09.980 --> 02:07:13.980]
but maybe he sure can bite it okay thanks a lot now I think he's got a good point he bites

[02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:18.920]
we have an open-minded Broward 5 6 7 0 5 so isn't this interesting all the people who agree with me who

[02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:21.840]
know something about the game because this guy obviously knows he's talking about the beanpot

[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:27.220]
tournament and Wayne Turner and you know he knows something so I think the fact that 80 or 90

[02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:30.760]
percent of the people in that joint are getting excited at the wrong time and emotional and

[02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:34.300]
hysterical over the wrong people that proves what I've said 80 or 90 percent of the people

5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0.5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[02:16:06.020 --> 02:16:07.380]
Here's the mobile in North Lauderdale.

[02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:07.640]
Hello.

[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:11.300]
Hey, Neil, I'm sitting here at two special stations.

[02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:13.360]
We're going to get that rod stuck in the enemy.

[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:13.880]
I'm eating my car.

[02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:14.300]
Yeah.

[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:17.280]
Hey, um, how about we get rid of Joeba now?

[02:16:17.380 --> 02:16:19.240]
Only 10 blocks and they stick it in your recto.

[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:20.000]
He's not bad, yeah.

[02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:20.900]
I know.

[02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:21.920]
I know we get rid of Joeba now.

[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:24.000]
He's been interesting by the way that Joeba now.

[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:26.900]
He's been fact that the first period last night he made a grotesque turn over.

[02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:29.240]
Luckily, they shot it one almost gave up an early goal.

[02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:30.920]
He's like, he's like, he's like, in physical out there.

[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:33.960]
He played horrendous against Tampa and our coach, Terry Murray,

[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:35.040]
don't confuse him with the truth.

[02:16:35.220 --> 02:16:37.560]
Says the guys that don't play good, they're going to get benched in the meantime.

[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:40.220]
He keeps sitting out, Gordon Murphy, who never still afraid to race.

[02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:41.820]
But Eddie gets a scholarship.

[02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:43.040]
He always gets a free pass.

[02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:44.580]
I still say Eddie, Joeba now.

[02:16:44.820 --> 02:16:47.700]
He's got naked pictures of the Murray brothers doing it with a goat.

[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:48.980]
I'm telling you right now.

[02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:49.720]
I agree.

[02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:52.840]
And also, I know that since he's gotten married and had a kid,

[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:54.480]
he doesn't hit anybody anymore.

[02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:57.460]
Well, you guys want to ruin his looks.

[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:01.160]
Okay, we have an open line at Broward, 5.6705.60,

[02:17:01.260 --> 02:17:02.840]
and 0.560 on the mobile one line.

[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.640]
Are these people addressing the thing that I'm trying to talk about here today?

[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:05.940]
No.

[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:06.300]
No.

[02:17:07.580 --> 02:17:11.540]
Anybody impressed by that phenomenal one of the goals of the year by Ray Whitney last night?

[02:17:11.620 --> 02:17:11.780]
No.

[02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:12.620]
Now they don't like him.

[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:14.860]
They figure if the coach don't like him, they don't like him.

[02:17:16.060 --> 02:17:19.240]
Which I'm very proud of myself, by the way, after they announced...

[02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:21.540]
After they announced the goal by Ray Whitney,

[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:25.940]
and a crowd finally, it subsided from their enormous emotion,

[02:17:25.940 --> 02:17:27.720]
which really wasn't that much like they should have been.

[02:17:28.100 --> 02:17:28.840]
So it was kind of quiet.

[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:32.280]
And I yelled out, since we sit directly behind Terry Murray up there,

[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:32.760]
a few rows.

[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:37.060]
And I yelled out, hey Terry, how do you like him now, you jackass?

[02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:42.440]
And the four or five fans in our section who know the game,

[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:46.360]
they were chuckling and muttering and agreeing under their breath.

[02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:49.200]
Here's the mobile in Miami.

[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:49.500]
Hello?

[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:50.940]
Yes, sir.

[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:52.100]
Do you know what I got?

[02:17:53.240 --> 02:17:53.740]
A Christmas?

[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:54.260]
Yeah.

[02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:57.040]
55 gallons of ocean.

[02:17:58.520 --> 02:17:59.440]
Okay, Eddie, thank you.

[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:03.840]
We have an...well, Eddie's the only guy in the NHL that puts his IQ on his uniform.

[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.820]
We have an open line in Broward, 5.67.0.5.60,

[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:08.560]
0.560, 0.560 on the mobile one line.

[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:10.780]
And as far as that lotion's concern, sir?

[02:18:12.140 --> 02:18:13.680]
Here's Fort Myers, hello?

[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:14.640]
Bill?

[02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:15.140]
Yes, sir.

[02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:18.000]
Hey, I wanted to help you with your toilet seat.

[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:18.600]
Yeah?

[02:18:18.860 --> 02:18:19.860]
Okay, you have about that.

[02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:23.140]
But I also wanted to tell you about the guy over here.

[02:18:23.180 --> 02:18:24.640]
I mean, here they know a lot about that in Fort Myers.

[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:25.520]
Yeah, we're talking about that.

[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:28.040]
Well, we have Ruth fans over here with hockey, you know?

[02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:29.800]
I appreciate what you were talking about.

[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:33.620]
One of them got hit in the head with a hockey stick by a player the other night.

[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:33.820]
Good.

[02:18:34.100 --> 02:18:35.180]
So he took care of him.

[02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:36.300]
That's right, I was asked about him.

[02:18:36.380 --> 02:18:38.200]
On your toilet seat, I'm going to help you with it.

[02:18:38.220 --> 02:18:38.440]
Okay.

[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:40.700]
You have an elongated toilet bowl.

[02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:41.780]
I have a long one, yeah?

[02:18:42.020 --> 02:18:44.920]
Yeah, so you need an elongated toilet seat.

[02:18:45.340 --> 02:18:45.700]
Yeah.

[02:18:45.700 --> 02:18:46.900]
That gives you enough room there.

[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:47.740]
Well, how do you know?

[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:51.160]
Well, you can tell by the oval shape or the round shape.

[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:52.160]
Okay, one.

[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:52.920]
You're right.

[02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:53.260]
Good point.

[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:54.300]
The one I bought was round.

[02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:54.640]
You're right.

[02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:57.780]
You can't stick around seat on the oval turlant.

[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.840]
And go to the, go to the, go to the, if you've got an oval rectum.

[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:02.540]
Sit your ass on an oval turlant.

[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:04.560]
If you've got a round rectum, sit on a round turlant.

[02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:05.040]
Good point.

[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:08.480]
Well, just go to a good supply house and you get a decent one.

[02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:10.940]
I'm going right over to a builder square, one of those joints.

[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:11.660]
They'll have it.

[02:19:11.780 --> 02:19:14.160]
They got, they got the toilet seats up to the bed.

[02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:14.740]

[02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:17.780]
And tell them you want a, you want an elongated seat.

[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:18.760]
I tell them I want a long one.

[02:19:18.820 --> 02:19:19.220]
Okay, pal.

[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:19.540]
All right.

[02:19:19.620 --> 02:19:20.720]
Happy new year over there in four miles.

[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:21.420]
All right, thanks.

[02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:21.980]
See ya.

[02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:25.320]
All our friends in four miles, all 30 or 40, keep going, baby.

[02:19:25.460 --> 02:19:25.620]
Oh.

[02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:27.200]
They keep the radio hidden under your bed.

[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:28.640]
Keep it down, not too loud.

[02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:30.520]
We have an open line in there.

[02:19:30.580 --> 02:19:31.980]
They'll come and get you an open line in date.

[02:19:31.980 --> 02:19:35.380]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60 on a mobile one line.

[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:37.760]
I mean, like I said yesterday, that's, that's always getting a little bit

[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:38.580]
anti about it.

[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:40.460]
The new experience in my life.

[02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:43.000]
I've never had to go out there and buy a toilet seat before.

[02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:45.140]
And you know what else?

[02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:48.960]
Because every now and then you'll sit on a toilet seat and they'll start

[02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:51.260]
like moving around a little bit as you're like, you're moving.

[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:54.200]
You know, you're trying to like, you know, get that little hanger off of there to drop.

[02:19:55.860 --> 02:19:57.320]
And the seat will start like moving around.

[02:19:57.460 --> 02:19:59.140]
See this supposed to be stationary, baby.

[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:00.680]
It should not move when your ass moves.

[02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:05.300]
And I never realized that under those little brackets that hold the seat under the

[02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:08.360]
bowl, there are those little plastic screws.

[02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:13.660]
And so I immediately yesterday now that I'm a great mechanic after I had my

[02:20:13.660 --> 02:20:15.860]
misadventure with my own, I went to the other toilet.

[02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:20.700]
And after I, well, I actually before I did because, you know, the worst thing in the

[02:20:20.700 --> 02:20:24.160]
world to do is like bend over a toilet after you're just, even if you're flushed

[02:20:24.160 --> 02:20:24.480]
real good.

[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:27.500]
So you don't want to be screwing around with it after the deed.

[02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:32.500]
But before I sat down, I got my trusty screwdriver and I tightened that baby up and no more

[02:20:32.500 --> 02:20:33.960]
slipping and sliding down the bowl, man.

[02:20:36.180 --> 02:20:37.840]
Here on that bowl, you want to firm grip.

[02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:39.600]
Here's a candle.

[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:39.900]
Hello.

[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:41.360]
You're funny, well.

[02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:41.920]
Yes, I was.

[02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:42.600]
I'm okay.

[02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:43.660]
I'm doing the actin's diet.

[02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:44.500]
You what?

[02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:45.700]
The actin's diet?

[02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:46.020]
Yeah.

[02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:48.260]
They just found that I'm diabetics.

[02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:51.000]
And I remember you said that you got off your influence.

[02:20:51.460 --> 02:20:51.620]
Right.

[02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:53.100]
I never did insulin.

[02:20:53.460 --> 02:20:57.420]
I said that if you, for most people, why type do diabetics that the actin's will

[02:20:57.420 --> 02:20:59.300]
get your blood sugar down like a mirror?

[02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:00.240]
Do you see how I'm high blood sugar?

[02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:01.040]
I'm high blood sugar?

[02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:01.560]
Right.

[02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:04.720]
Did you ever get a sweet taste in your mouth like a new saliva?

[02:21:05.020 --> 02:21:06.480]
I've had a sweet taste in my mouth, you know?

[02:21:06.660 --> 02:21:07.060]
No, I'm certain.

[02:21:07.060 --> 02:21:07.640]
Many times.

[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:09.200]
I mean, sweet bad beef from your diabetes.

[02:21:09.580 --> 02:21:09.840]
No.

[02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:10.740]
Here we got that.

[02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:12.060]
Well, how high is your blood sugar?

[02:21:12.900 --> 02:21:14.500]
Oh, I haven't checked it today, but oh.

[02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:17.340]
No, but I mean, when, how long have you been diagnosed as diabetics?

[02:21:17.380 --> 02:21:18.280]
Oh, like two weeks ago.

[02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:19.420]
Because I wasn't aware of that.

[02:21:19.420 --> 02:21:20.460]
How high was your blood sugar?

[02:21:20.680 --> 02:21:21.100]
Like 220.

[02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:22.840]
Well, that's not real bad.

[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:26.100]
I mean, I went to the doctor and I told him I have this sweet taste of mouth.

[02:21:26.780 --> 02:21:27.740]
It tastes like a...

[02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:29.840]
Because I know that when you get high blood sugar, you get a...

[02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:30.820]
With a carf-free...

[02:21:30.820 --> 02:21:31.100]
A fruit...

[02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:32.560]
A sweet smell.

[02:21:33.160 --> 02:21:34.660]
That's the ketones in your body.

[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:37.500]
And I told him about that.

[02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:39.620]
He said, well, it's a check your blood sugar and it was high at the time.

[02:21:39.700 --> 02:21:39.900]
Yeah.

[02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:41.740]
So, what do you want?

[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:42.520]
You want my oral?

[02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:43.680]
Which I...

[02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:44.280]
Yeah, I'm on the oral.

[02:21:44.420 --> 02:21:45.220]
He put me on the pillow now.

[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:46.380]
I have to see if he put me on diet.

[02:21:46.580 --> 02:21:47.360]
So, as he says that.

[02:21:47.940 --> 02:21:49.160]
Oh, yeah, he put you on a diet.

[02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:49.860]
Yeah, let me tell you.

[02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:52.460]
The doctor probably does no squat about diabetes.

[02:21:52.680 --> 02:21:52.880]
He'll...

[02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:53.620]
He'll pretend he does.

[02:21:53.620 --> 02:21:56.600]
Well, he told me that the sweet taste of mouth could have been further.

[02:21:56.680 --> 02:21:57.720]
Get about the sweet taste.

[02:21:57.840 --> 02:21:58.840]
What is your blood sugar today?

[02:21:58.960 --> 02:21:59.680]
What was it this morning?

[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:00.440]
I haven't checked it yet.

[02:22:00.660 --> 02:22:01.280]
Well, why not?

[02:22:01.580 --> 02:22:02.060]
I don't know.

[02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:04.220]
How can you be diabetic and you're not checking?

[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:05.480]
You have one of the little...

[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:05.680]
Yes.

[02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:06.660]
One touch.

[02:22:07.220 --> 02:22:08.860]
We have a one-touch thing, okay?

[02:22:08.980 --> 02:22:09.060]
Yeah.

[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:11.200]
Okay, so check it out.

[02:22:11.420 --> 02:22:12.760]
What was it yesterday?

[02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:13.840]
Yesterday was already.

[02:22:13.980 --> 02:22:14.380]
It was 110.

[02:22:15.420 --> 02:22:16.760]
Without it, I didn't take the pillow yesterday.

[02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:17.320]
It was 110.

[02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:20.280]
You didn't take the pillow it was 110, which is normal, by the way.

[02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:21.060]
You do understand that.

[02:22:21.180 --> 02:22:22.720]
Yeah, I go 140 is boy-like.

[02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:24.040]
120 is better.

[02:22:24.040 --> 02:22:26.000]
Sure, sure, there is no such thing.

[02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:27.340]
It's like borderline pregnant.

[02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:30.620]
There is no such thing in the world as borderline diabetic.

[02:22:30.860 --> 02:22:32.160]
Either you are or you're not.

[02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:35.040]
No, I'm saying that the cutoff point for doctor...

[02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:38.640]
I understand, but I'm just telling you again, because doctors like to use that term.

[02:22:38.780 --> 02:22:39.820]
Oh, you might be a little...

[02:22:39.820 --> 02:22:43.560]
Before I was diagnosed as diabetic, I went to one jackass doctor in the Gables,

[02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:46.900]
and his comment to me was, oh, you might be a little borderline diabetic.

[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:48.600]
And there's no such thing.

[02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:49.620]
You know, you're not.

[02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:50.220]
Right.

[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:51.180]
That's true, my God.

[02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:52.880]
Well, keep monitoring in a few episodes.

[02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:54.620]
You're having a problem read the Atkins book.

[02:22:54.820 --> 02:22:56.100]
Believe me, it works like a miracle.

[02:22:56.300 --> 02:22:57.700]
I was wondering about the taste of them all.

[02:22:57.780 --> 02:22:58.260]
I never noticed that.

[02:22:58.260 --> 02:23:00.060]
Okay, well listen, stop by doing whatever you do.

[02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:01.740]
Okay, that's why I've got that taste in my shoes.

[02:23:02.060 --> 02:23:02.440]
Jesus, God.

[02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:05.960]
Yeah, I've had a sweet taste in my mouth.

[02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:06.540]
Squirt, squirt.

[02:23:06.660 --> 02:23:08.640]
We have two open lines in a day and one and a half.

[02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:09.140]
Look at this.

[02:23:09.220 --> 02:23:09.840]
Look at this, crowd here.

[02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:12.740]
And it's almost 1 o'clock, and we still haven't had what I'm looking for here today.

[02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:14.700]
Just one honest Panther fan.

[02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:16.240]
One, just one.

[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:17.960]
Can we find it?

[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:18.160]
No.

[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:19.320]
Tim, her, it.

[02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:19.580]
No.

[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:24.400]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:25.080]
We've got to gather things.

[02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:27.760]
Kevin Weeks is still on our team, which I thought was pretty interesting.

[02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:29.620]
Here's Coral Springs.

[02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:29.960]
Hello.

[02:23:30.520 --> 02:23:30.800]
Hello.

[02:23:31.080 --> 02:23:31.360]
Yes, sir.

[02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:33.060]
Can't hear you.

[02:23:33.180 --> 02:23:34.040]
Section 409.

[02:23:34.180 --> 02:23:34.360]
Yes.

[02:23:35.060 --> 02:23:37.800]
Ray Whitney, let a great play last night.

[02:23:37.900 --> 02:23:38.080]
Yeah.

[02:23:38.420 --> 02:23:39.280]
He's fan low.

[02:23:39.520 --> 02:23:41.480]
I don't know a good hockey game when they say.

[02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:42.100]
Okay, thank you.

[02:23:42.260 --> 02:23:43.520]
Here's another guy just to Greenland.

[02:23:43.600 --> 02:23:44.140]
That's great.

[02:23:44.180 --> 02:23:46.120]
Okay, I don't want to be ruddy, sir, but it's boring.

[02:23:46.380 --> 02:23:47.000]
I know that.

[02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:48.940]
You don't have to tell me about Ray Whitney and that cool line.

[02:23:48.940 --> 02:23:49.880]
This guy just said, it was great.

[02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:52.560]
But we're in a minority.

[02:23:52.900 --> 02:23:55.560]
Okay, 99% of the people in there can't be wrong.

[02:23:57.340 --> 02:23:58.440]
I'm just going to, you know what?

[02:23:58.440 --> 02:23:59.120]
I'm going on strike.

[02:23:59.340 --> 02:24:00.120]
I can't do this.

[02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:01.440]
I will not do this.

[02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:05.780]
I'm just going to go on strike.

[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:08.880]
I'm going to sit back in my goddamn chair and, and twiddle my thumbs

[02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:11.320]
and chew these halls mental lip this, okay?

[02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:14.600]
Which by the way, oh, you, and you were here yesterday.

[02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:16.000]
I had my thing about sorbitol.

[02:24:16.140 --> 02:24:18.920]
Did you know that sorbitol is a substance that occurs within the body?

[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:20.320]
No.

[02:24:20.580 --> 02:24:22.600]
And if you're diabetic, it's very bad for you.

[02:24:22.980 --> 02:24:26.000]
And so now you know when I take anything, I eat anything with sorbitol in it.

[02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:26.800]
There's a sugar substitute.

[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:29.700]
It makes me just, and just sick as a dog.

[02:24:30.180 --> 02:24:31.240]
Now I understand why.

[02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:36.000]
Thanks to another fine nutrition book that I'm reading, which I won't burden you with today,

[02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:37.100]
because I don't have it with me anyway.

[02:24:37.540 --> 02:24:40.020]
And you don't want to hear about it, because you want to go out and eat fish food, which is fine.

[02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:41.500]
Until you die.

[02:24:42.460 --> 02:24:44.020]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:46.020]
I'm just going to sit back and wait on you, okay?

[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:47.820]
All you Peter were all lovers out there.

[02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:50.740]
All you people that think you understand what a hockey game is all about.

[02:24:51.140 --> 02:24:52.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:54.720]
Palm 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:58.720]
All you people that want to stand up in front of everybody else and ruin our enjoyment of watching the game.

[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:02.400]
All you people that want to go out there and do the dirty bird, watch yourself up on the screen,

[02:25:02.740 --> 02:25:04.160]
act in luck some kind of a chicken and heat.

[02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:06.220]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:08.260]
Palm 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:10.800]
I'll get it.

[02:25:11.620 --> 02:25:12.100]
Q, A, M.

[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:14.220]
I'll hit it again.

[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:15.260]
Oh, sorry.

[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:16.260]
Like I said, I'll hit it.

[02:25:16.540 --> 02:25:17.080]
Q, A, M.

[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:18.380]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:18.880]
Okay, sir.

[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:19.460]
All right.

[02:25:19.620 --> 02:25:21.520]
I just want to talk about the Panthers game last night.

[02:25:21.620 --> 02:25:22.360]
I thought we kicked parts.

[02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:22.760]
Yeah.

[02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:24.580]
And I don't know.

[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:25.500]
It was a good atmosphere.

[02:25:25.940 --> 02:25:30.660]
We probably got a little routy for, you know, that lane national car rental center.

[02:25:30.660 --> 02:25:32.700]
And I saw you down there.

[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:34.040]
I just wanted to say go Panthers.

[02:25:34.540 --> 02:25:34.860]
Okay.

[02:25:35.180 --> 02:25:35.460]
Later.

[02:25:35.780 --> 02:25:36.040]
See you.

[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:36.760]
Okay, there you go.

[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:39.820]
Is that what I was looking for?

[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:40.460]
He's a good guy.

[02:25:40.500 --> 02:25:41.260]
Is that what I was looking for?

[02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:41.260]

[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:42.520]
No, not what I was looking for.

[02:25:42.780 --> 02:25:44.240]
Because you're not going to get what you're looking for.

[02:25:44.580 --> 02:25:47.060]
Sometimes in this town you'll discover you go out there and you're going to see the game.

[02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:47.580]
You look around.

[02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:48.980]
You find what you're looking for?

[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:49.180]
No.

[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:49.560]
No.

[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:51.100]
Believe me.

[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:52.160]
Not in this place.

[02:25:53.460 --> 02:25:56.500]
If you're looking for dead old people or those on the verge.

[02:25:56.800 --> 02:25:59.540]
If you're looking for a place, and this cracks me up.

[02:25:59.780 --> 02:26:04.460]
They want to make, they want everybody to know that the sunrise is the home of the national car rental center.

[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:05.280]
Not for a lot of deal.

[02:26:05.820 --> 02:26:07.380]
Because they want to put sunrise on the map.

[02:26:07.820 --> 02:26:10.420]
Why don't they just put a big on the map and that's sunrise.

[02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:14.980]
How about we all meet at sunrise, lakes before the game and share a nice blueberry animal.

[02:26:15.060 --> 02:26:15.840]
Sounds good to me.

[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:16.680]
Oh, okay.

[02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:19.220]
WQAM.

[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:20.440]
Hello.

[02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:21.040]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:21.940]
Yeah.

[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:23.220]
I want to talk to Neil.

[02:26:23.340 --> 02:26:23.540]
Speaking.

[02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:24.280]
Speaking.

[02:26:24.980 --> 02:26:25.380]
Neil?

[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:25.760]
Yes.

[02:26:26.260 --> 02:26:26.620]
Oh, hi.

[02:26:26.820 --> 02:26:26.940]
Yeah.

[02:26:27.020 --> 02:26:28.500]
What's going on with the Panthers?

[02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:30.200]
What do I want to know?

[02:26:30.300 --> 02:26:33.040]
I want to know why the crowd is fascinated with Peter Warrell.

[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:35.980]
Because all he does is fight.

[02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:36.680]
Yeah.

[02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:37.940]
That's all they have.

[02:26:37.940 --> 02:26:39.360]
That's only reason why he's a big good.

[02:26:39.780 --> 02:26:40.000]
Yeah.

[02:26:40.700 --> 02:26:42.460]
We agree with the game last night, sir.

[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:43.080]
Yes, I was.

[02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:46.800]
And did you see the reaction when he got in the fight and a standing ovation and they're going

[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:53.200]
Peter, Peter even though that the three or four shifts he was out in the game he kept falling down and did nothing to contribute to the otherwise outstanding victory.

[02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:54.400]
You're absolutely correct.

[02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:55.240]
So what is that all about?

[02:26:55.760 --> 02:26:58.600]
Because the people there, we noticed they were not so aware they bring all the kids.

[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:00.300]
They're at the social event.

[02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:01.320]
You're right.

[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:02.180]
You're absolutely right.

[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:02.820]
You know something.

[02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:04.560]
I'm asking a rhetorical question.

[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:07.300]
I'm getting myself all worked up about it and I already know the answer.

[02:27:07.660 --> 02:27:09.400]
They don't go there to watch the guy they're in game.

[02:27:09.660 --> 02:27:11.000]
They're there to schmooze and hang out.

[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:15.480]
And if somebody gets into a big brawl that's the only thing they can react to because anybody can understand a brawl.

[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:16.680]
You're actually correct.

[02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:17.740]
Okay, God bless you, sir.

[02:27:17.940 --> 02:27:18.380]
All right, thank you.

[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:18.860]
There you go.

[02:27:20.860 --> 02:27:22.040]
Thank God for him.

[02:27:23.340 --> 02:27:24.540]
What are you smoking about?

[02:27:25.220 --> 02:27:26.400]
He's summed it up best.

[02:27:27.860 --> 02:27:29.120]
I already know the answer.

[02:27:29.280 --> 02:27:32.080]
When people don't understand what they're watching they can understand.

[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:34.360]
I mean, even a little kid can understand a brawl.

[02:27:34.420 --> 02:27:34.880]
Hey, look at that.

[02:27:34.940 --> 02:27:36.040]
He beat the crap out of daddy.

[02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:36.920]
Okay, great.

[02:27:37.340 --> 02:27:37.800]
All right.

[02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:39.500]
That's our hero.

[02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:45.320]
That's a big black guy named Peter who couldn't skate his way out of a goddamn parking lot.

[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:47.600]
But he's our hero.

[02:27:47.780 --> 02:27:48.980]
He's the enforcer, baby.

[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:51.800]
He's the Don Corleone of the Appanthitine.

[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:53.760]
Anybody buying that?

[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:54.000]
No.

[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:59.860]
We have an open line at date 56670560 and bought 560 on the mobile one line.

[02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:01.000]
Oh, God.

[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:01.640]
What a place.

[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:02.180]
This town.

[02:28:02.780 --> 02:28:03.660]
This town.

[02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:08.440]
I'm serious if they could just get that enormous animal tube from the sky.

[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:12.740]
And stick it like right at the Golden Glades interchange would be a perfect spot.

[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:14.160]
Oh, my God.

[02:28:14.420 --> 02:28:17.020]
That's what we need is a gigantic animal from heaven.

[02:28:18.420 --> 02:28:20.780]
All this scare we're hearing about the year 2000.

[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:24.980]
I pray that a year from now we look up there just like at the Panther game.

[02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:29.560]
You see that Panther or the ass of that Panther that said that they lowered down on the ice very slowly.

[02:28:29.940 --> 02:28:33.000]
And that five minute openings ceremony that seems to take a hundred hours.

[02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:44.620]
Maybe a year from now December 29th, 1990, and Yine will look up in the sky and we'll see like they look like a gigantic elephant trunk hanging down from the sky from the heavens.

[02:28:44.620 --> 02:28:46.620]
It'll be God's enema tube.

[02:28:47.940 --> 02:28:51.900]
And it'll be aiming straight toward the Golden Glades interchange.

[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:52.680]
Oh, yeah.

[02:28:55.260 --> 02:28:57.520]
Giving this town exactly what it needs.

[02:28:57.820 --> 02:28:59.120]
A cleansing experience.

[02:29:01.780 --> 02:29:03.920]
1257 at 560 WQF.

[02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:10.360]
The Neil Rogers show now on 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale.

[02:29:10.460 --> 02:29:13.080]
Oh, boy. It's the one to two hour.

[02:29:15.240 --> 02:29:16.280]
This is Debbie.

[02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:19.900]
Hi, Debbie. I'm interested in getting some operations done.

[02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:20.640]
Okay.

[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:23.000]
And some body contouring and some liposuction.

[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:31.020]
And I was wondering if it's a tummy tuck and lip augmentation cosmetic compress surgery face tip for all of these things.

[02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:32.620]
And I was wondering.

[02:29:32.980 --> 02:29:33.780]
What would you like to start with?

[02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:36.260]
Well, I need to get everything done.

[02:29:36.460 --> 02:29:40.700]
Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my thing.

[02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:42.260]
Okay, we don't do that.

[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:44.640]
No. Could you do breast implants though?

[02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:46.760]
Uh, I can't be done.

[02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:47.540]
But then it's not there.

[02:29:47.640 --> 02:29:50.220]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:29:51.460 --> 02:29:52.340]
How much?

[02:29:52.800 --> 02:29:53.900]
Uh, 5,000.

[02:29:54.260 --> 02:29:56.980]
Excellent. I'd like to have my skin resurface too.

[02:29:57.780 --> 02:29:58.820]
Lace of surgery.

[02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:02.740]
Have the lamb stop crying yet, mommy?

[02:30:03.460 --> 02:30:04.040]
Excuse me?

[02:30:04.540 --> 02:30:05.960]
Don't hurt mommy's little baby.

[02:30:06.460 --> 02:30:08.480]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:12.240]
I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV.

[02:30:12.800 --> 02:30:13.140]
Okay.

[02:30:13.540 --> 02:30:15.380]
Can you make me look more like a woman?

[02:30:15.780 --> 02:30:19.340]
Well, we'll have to see you first and then upon looking at you, we can tell you that when we see you.

[02:30:19.340 --> 02:30:23.400]
Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts, mommy?

[02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:25.180]
Uh, if you'd like to.

[02:30:25.660 --> 02:30:27.420]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:28.800]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:29.940]
Yes.

[02:30:30.400 --> 02:30:33.580]
Okay. Um, there is a $100 consultation fee.

[02:30:33.920 --> 02:30:34.480]
That's fine.

[02:30:36.420 --> 02:30:36.900]
Yes.

[02:30:37.860 --> 02:30:41.280]
Okay. Um, my name is Buffalo Bill.

[02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:43.320]
Okay, let me give you a little information from you.

[02:30:43.520 --> 02:30:44.140]
Okay, just one moment.

[02:30:44.460 --> 02:30:46.800]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:47.840]
I understand.

[02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:50.360]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:53.460]
Do you want to come in for a consultation for a life?

[02:30:53.460 --> 02:30:56.540]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:57.680]
Uh, okay.

[02:30:58.560 --> 02:30:59.780]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:00.720]
Or do you want to call me back?

[02:31:00.900 --> 02:31:02.800]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:31:02.960 --> 02:31:03.380]
I understand.

[02:31:03.380 --> 02:31:07.200]
I got my skin suit and you're probably like, uh, uh, uh.

[02:31:07.200 --> 02:31:07.500]
Bill.

[02:31:08.100 --> 02:31:10.260]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:11.540]
I understand that.

[02:31:11.620 --> 02:31:14.120]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:31:14.700 --> 02:31:15.780]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[02:31:15.780 --> 02:31:17.800]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:19.520]
Okay. I will talk to you in the chat.

[02:31:19.840 --> 02:31:19.840]

[02:31:20.200 --> 02:31:21.840]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:22.600]
Hello.

[02:31:24.660 --> 02:31:25.340]
Is he done?

[02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:25.720]
Yes.

[02:31:25.980 --> 02:31:26.540]
Okay. Thank you.

[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:27.960]
103 is 560.

[02:31:28.160 --> 02:31:29.400]
WQM. We have an open line in date.

[02:31:29.460 --> 02:31:31.600]
If we move quickly, 567-0560,

[02:31:31.960 --> 02:31:34.260]
pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:36.580]
And we discovered today, we didn't discover too much,

[02:31:36.660 --> 02:31:39.980]
but we did discover that most white people respect big, big black guys

[02:31:39.980 --> 02:31:41.180]
because they're terrified of them.

[02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:42.880]
Here's Hylia. Hello.

[02:31:43.540 --> 02:31:43.880]
Niel.

[02:31:43.880 --> 02:31:44.720]
Yes, sir.

[02:31:44.720 --> 02:31:45.940]
Who you from Hylia?

[02:31:46.200 --> 02:31:46.360]
See?

[02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:49.840]
Me complaining about the Italian guy who called a little while ago.

[02:31:50.140 --> 02:31:50.480]
What is it?

[02:31:51.240 --> 02:31:53.360]
Italian guy who called a little while ago.

[02:31:53.380 --> 02:31:53.520]
Yeah.

[02:31:53.740 --> 02:31:57.620]
Complaining about how it's pulling, uh, kids, uh, latin names.

[02:31:57.860 --> 02:31:58.060]
Yeah.

[02:31:58.420 --> 02:32:00.280]
My complaint is, uh,

[02:32:00.360 --> 02:32:01.260]
What is your complaint, sir?

[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:03.660]
Well, how about these African Americans putting all these

[02:32:03.660 --> 02:32:07.860]
Tarzan and Jane movie names to their kids, you know, Tarwanda and Peter?

[02:32:08.700 --> 02:32:11.300]
I would prefer Tarzan and Jane when they come right down to it.

[02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:11.900]
Exactly.

[02:32:11.900 --> 02:32:14.620]
Wouldn't that be an improvement over a Niquana and, uh,

[02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:17.900]
and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, and Cheetah.

[02:32:18.020 --> 02:32:18.680]
Boy, she pulled it.

[02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:19.560]
It were a cheetah, yeah.

[02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:21.720]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, and I think too.

[02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:24.380]
You know what I'd say at the track is nothing worse than a cheetah, man.

[02:32:24.580 --> 02:32:26.240]
Ha, ha, ha, and I think too.

[02:32:26.620 --> 02:32:30.640]
Uh, how about the name for a guy who used to run the, the, the port of man?

[02:32:30.820 --> 02:32:31.920]
Everybody's Philly on all we said.

[02:32:31.960 --> 02:32:32.380]
What is it?

[02:32:32.580 --> 02:32:33.080]
What's his name?

[02:32:33.280 --> 02:32:33.960]
Carmen Munetta?

[02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:34.780]
Carmen No.

[02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:35.340]
Miranda, yeah.

[02:32:35.460 --> 02:32:36.180]
Carmen Miranda.

[02:32:37.320 --> 02:32:42.280]
You imagine being a, a, a, a, a male, a child being named Carmen?

[02:32:42.440 --> 02:32:42.600]
No.

[02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:44.060]
Oh my god.

[02:32:44.200 --> 02:32:45.740]
No Nelson was bad enough with Carmen.

[02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:47.680]
Oh god, I was really bad for me.

[02:32:48.560 --> 02:32:50.360]
Hey, now, I'll send this request.

[02:32:50.540 --> 02:32:50.880]
Yes, sir.

[02:32:51.200 --> 02:32:52.520]
Um, what's up?

[02:32:52.640 --> 02:32:54.160]
The priest from the Exorcist?

[02:32:54.540 --> 02:32:54.900]
Yeah.

[02:32:55.240 --> 02:32:56.600]
Uh, what was, uh, what was it?

[02:32:56.880 --> 02:32:59.140]
Power of Christ composes you.

[02:32:59.340 --> 02:33:01.600]
Dr. Paul Christ composes you.

[02:33:01.600 --> 02:33:03.880]
Oh, you made me the power of Christ.

[02:33:04.120 --> 02:33:04.780]
Oh, thank you.

[02:33:04.900 --> 02:33:05.240]
Thank you.

[02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:05.900]
How about one more?

[02:33:06.020 --> 02:33:08.200]
Power of Christ composes you.

[02:33:08.520 --> 02:33:08.700]
Okay.

[02:33:08.880 --> 02:33:08.880]

[02:33:08.920 --> 02:33:10.200]
Ask, ask, ask your cameo.

[02:33:10.300 --> 02:33:10.800]
Ask your piece.

[02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:11.360]
Get out of here.

[02:33:11.860 --> 02:33:12.640]
Ask your cameo.

[02:33:12.760 --> 02:33:15.080]
He just, we have an open line in the day.

[02:33:15.220 --> 02:33:16.580]

[02:33:17.080 --> 02:33:17.460]
Come on.

[02:33:17.540 --> 02:33:17.960]
Come on.

[02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:18.480]
One more.

[02:33:18.680 --> 02:33:21.020]
That's a power of Christ composes you.

[02:33:21.140 --> 02:33:21.440]
Thank you.

[02:33:22.340 --> 02:33:23.400]
And pound 5 6.

[02:33:23.400 --> 02:33:25.680]
Before you mobile people on the 18 T wireless line.

[02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:27.860]
So we got, Kimba is in for Hank today.

[02:33:28.300 --> 02:33:29.220]
Kimba and, uh, D.

[02:33:29.340 --> 02:33:30.440]
And we got that bull.

[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:31.760]
We got all kinds of D.

[02:33:31.760 --> 02:33:34.760]
That cocauses to holidays and a lot of people want off and who can blame them.

[02:33:35.580 --> 02:33:37.020]
Are we going to be here Friday, by the way?

[02:33:37.140 --> 02:33:37.280]
No.

[02:33:37.540 --> 02:33:38.060]
New Year's day.

[02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:41.080]
We're not going to, we got ball games up your record on the Friday.

[02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:42.460]
All kinds of ball games this weekend.

[02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:44.960]
And by the way, who was it?

[02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:49.220]
It was, uh, Joe Rosius that in morning, muttering out loud, how come the program directors on vacation this week?

[02:33:49.260 --> 02:33:52.700]
We got all these ball games coming on because that's what was, uh, intentional.

[02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:54.700]
We're hoping we can get them on right.

[02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:55.040]
Okay.

[02:33:56.020 --> 02:33:58.880]
So as long as he's not here, we might have a Chinaman's chance, so to speak.

[02:33:59.980 --> 02:34:03.900]
So how about like some Chinese Americans, some Chinese Canadians?

[02:34:04.620 --> 02:34:05.800]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:06.140]
Hello.

[02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:07.980]
Hello.

[02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:08.460]
Yes, sir.

[02:34:09.060 --> 02:34:10.060]
Yeah, how are you doing, Neil?

[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:10.340]
Great.

[02:34:10.880 --> 02:34:11.680]
First time, long time.

[02:34:11.920 --> 02:34:12.160]
All right.

[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:16.460]
Listen, I'm here to give you some advice about your toilet seat.

[02:34:17.620 --> 02:34:18.700]
Go to home, Deepo.

[02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:19.120]
Yeah.

[02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:23.200]
And get the one with the chrome hinges on it.

[02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:24.200]
Look, you don't own hinges?

[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:26.220]
Yeah, so you don't pinch your butt.

[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:29.060]
You don't pinch your butt?

[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:30.480]
Yeah, you know how you say it.

[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:32.320]
It wiggles around from side to side.

[02:34:32.380 --> 02:34:32.600]
Yeah.

[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:36.620]
Well, if you get the one with the chrome hinges on it, you won't have a problem with that.

[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:37.080]
Okay.

[02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:38.220]
It's a lot sturdier.

[02:34:38.780 --> 02:34:40.640]
Now, but now, how about if somebody else pinches your butt?

[02:34:41.460 --> 02:34:42.680]
Well, then you got a problem there.

[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:44.520]
Well, it depends, I guess what it is, yeah.

[02:34:44.740 --> 02:34:45.040]
Yeah.

[02:34:45.660 --> 02:34:45.940]
All right.

[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:46.860]
That's all I got.

[02:34:46.980 --> 02:34:47.720]
Thank you very much, sir.

[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:48.320]
You're welcome.

[02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:50.260]
I'm going to check out my chrome hinges today.

[02:34:50.660 --> 02:34:51.820]
Hey, listen, I told you.

[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:56.200]
I can, I can take even getting a new toilet seat and making it with an art of something right now.

[02:34:56.200 --> 02:34:57.160]
I'm going to show you how do you like that?

[02:34:57.740 --> 02:34:58.360]
You like it?

[02:34:58.860 --> 02:34:59.240]
Do you?

[02:34:59.320 --> 02:34:59.460]
No.

[02:34:59.660 --> 02:35:00.220]
I didn't think so.

[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:01.300]
All right.

[02:35:01.460 --> 02:35:06.880]
So maybe it's not a big deal to you, but the next time your crapper loses its wrapper, you're going to be really pissed off.

[02:35:08.260 --> 02:35:09.840]
I just want to happen when they shot that.

[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:10.320]
What's his name?

[02:35:10.420 --> 02:35:10.940]
The crapper.

[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:11.780]
They lost its wrapper?

[02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:14.200]
How's he doing, by the way?

[02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:16.360]
Oh, he's drinking a six pack now.

[02:35:16.740 --> 02:35:17.040]
Where are we going?

[02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:18.920]
Here's a mobile in West Palm Beach.

[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:19.200]
Hello.

[02:35:20.020 --> 02:35:20.920]
Now, yes, sir.

[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:22.040]
What I've talked about the panthers.

[02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:23.980]
I can feel you agree with you about Peter Wrell.

[02:35:23.980 --> 02:35:25.380]
See, everybody agrees with me.

[02:35:25.460 --> 02:35:27.280]
All the people that call in here agree with me.

[02:35:27.580 --> 02:35:32.060]
And the other people, those pushies out there who were acting last night like they had sane biteers dead.

[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:33.500]
They don't have any balls at all.

[02:35:33.580 --> 02:35:34.480]
They're a bunch of cowards.

[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:35.780]
Well, Neil, here's what I want to know.

[02:35:36.140 --> 02:35:36.660]
They're going to jellyfish.

[02:35:36.980 --> 02:35:37.780]
They continue to play.

[02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:40.780]
Like Peter, like Peter Wrell, they'll see the play, Joe, and I'll ask you.

[02:35:40.860 --> 02:35:42.900]
If you have been scored Murphy for the last two games.

[02:35:43.160 --> 02:35:44.040]
And they've gone in.

[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:46.220]
And they've gone in plus minus at this point.

[02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:46.800]
Right.

[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:49.160]
And Murray's thinking, why is he playing these players that can play with these players?

[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:51.320]
Oh, you're so Murray, Murray's thinking.

[02:35:51.320 --> 02:35:53.280]
Now you're getting a dangerous territory.

[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:54.680]
He's not.

[02:35:54.700 --> 02:35:56.220]
I used to watch him when he was up in the Philadelphia.

[02:35:56.620 --> 02:35:58.560]
And he did the same bonehead move that he was down here now.

[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:00.160]
See, he likes to play games.

[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:05.320]
Even though the team is doing very well right now, you've got to understand we're playing some really, I mean, the islanders last night were horrendous.

[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:06.620]
But it's this nice that we're winning.

[02:36:06.860 --> 02:36:08.240]
But you've got to keep it in perspective.

[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:10.020]
We're not playing very good teams right at the moment.

[02:36:10.380 --> 02:36:15.940]
But this guy, what he's showing me, the way he likes playing head games with these guys, and he's trying to cycle and all that.

[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:16.860]
It doesn't work.

[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:18.340]
It doesn't work.

[02:36:18.740 --> 02:36:21.500]
He's only been to the veterans that are actually performing fairly well.

[02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:24.480]
Like that game earlier in the year, he benched Spayla and Whitney of all people.

[02:36:24.860 --> 02:36:26.480]
And before you know, the season really got rolling.

[02:36:26.620 --> 02:36:28.780]
He's telling people he doesn't like Ray Whitney as a player.

[02:36:28.780 --> 02:36:29.440]
He's too small.

[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:33.460]
And at any time, all he is is leading the team in goals and assists and points.

[02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:35.540]
And you name it and he is unbelievable.

[02:36:36.140 --> 02:36:36.500]
And in the meantime.

[02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:37.220]
Made a great pass.

[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:39.580]
I made a great play on the first goal last night for Carcner.

[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:41.800]
May so super play in a perfect pass.

[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:43.060]
I mean, this kid is unbelievable.

[02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:44.320]
And we got a coach well.

[02:36:44.540 --> 02:36:45.460]
He's too small, you know.

[02:36:45.460 --> 02:36:49.620]
And yet, over and off, he gives away and the offense is on every single day.

[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:52.780]
Two words naked pictures.

[02:36:52.980 --> 02:36:53.880]
Just keep that in mind.

[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:54.840]
Naked pictures.

[02:36:55.080 --> 02:36:55.700]
Okay, thanks.

[02:36:55.800 --> 02:36:56.680]
Okay, I have a great day.

[02:36:58.680 --> 02:36:59.180]
That's right.

[02:36:59.280 --> 02:36:59.640]
The Murray's.

[02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:01.340]
We even know the name of the goat by the way, it was Billy.

[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:04.780]
The Murray's and a Billy goat.

[02:37:04.820 --> 02:37:07.900]
And he's got a he's got a closet full of those pictures.

[02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:09.020]
You he ain't going nowhere.

[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:09.320]
Eddie.

[02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:12.080]
He's going to be an all star in this in this organization.

[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:13.100]
Someday you watch.

[02:37:13.100 --> 02:37:13.980]
He's going to be an all star.

[02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:14.960]
Anybody believe it?

[02:37:14.960 --> 02:37:15.180]
No.

[02:37:15.300 --> 02:37:16.660]
No, I'll start giveaway artists.

[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:21.720]
In fact, the rumor is that he was playing Santa Claus at the malls this Christmas because

[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:23.980]
he's had so much practice given stuff away.

[02:37:25.420 --> 02:37:26.860]
9 minutes after 1 at 5.

[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:28.200]
60 WQAM.

[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:28.980]
You.

[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:30.080]
Yeah.

[02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:31.120]
Go.

[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:31.580]
Just.

[02:37:32.140 --> 02:37:36.740]
I guess we're going to a plane on your organ life, that is a master.

[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:39.080]
They were planning and you're looking too.

[02:37:47.620 --> 02:37:48.840]
Come on.

[02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:48.840]

[02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:52.200]
You're working for it.

[02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:59.520]
You're working for it.

[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:06.180]
She's doing me a sample.

[02:38:06.940 --> 02:38:07.180]
Why?

[02:38:08.260 --> 02:38:09.000]
You're so mad.

[02:38:09.060 --> 02:38:09.060]

[02:38:09.060 --> 02:38:09.060]

[02:38:09.060 --> 02:38:32.160]
Do you want我 right?

[02:38:43.300 --> 02:38:44.920]
I'm telling you what to just be escaping.

[02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:46.120]
Cut America 1998.

[02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:49.440]
All the American men learned better aim is muddy important man.

[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:51.460]
One third to one-fourteen boys, move it along.

[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:53.040]
One-fourteen at five sixty QA.

[02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:55.080]
We got all three day lines open here.

[02:38:55.780 --> 02:38:57.940]
All the P.O.R.L. fans are there in Dave County today.

[02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:02.180]
Five-six seven oh five sixty, pound five sixty on the 18 T wireless line.

[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:05.340]
Here's a lady in four-lawnerdale.

[02:39:05.340 --> 02:39:05.660]
Hello.

[02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:08.940]
Hello.

[02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:10.700]
I have some money in the drive-through called Kumbah.

[02:39:11.100 --> 02:39:12.720]
It was a little black one.

[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:15.280]
I wanted to call you because I thought she'd appreciate that name.

[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:15.920]
Kumbah.

[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:16.960]
Kumbah.

[02:39:17.340 --> 02:39:17.740]
Kumbah.

[02:39:17.820 --> 02:39:19.980]
I rode that ride in Bush Gardens.

[02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:21.240]
Yeah.

[02:39:21.660 --> 02:39:22.380]
And listen, I want to have...

[02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:24.960]
I heard you're making guide cars to Street Sells Weed out here on the street corner.

[02:39:25.100 --> 02:39:25.720]
His name is Kumbah.

[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:26.120]
Yeah.

[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:29.320]
I was wondering if you still have your Pop Belly pig?

[02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:30.720]
Yes, I do.

[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:31.220]
You do?

[02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:31.740]
No.

[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:32.620]
You don't?

[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:33.760]
Pop Belly pig.

[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:34.340]
Yeah.

[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:36.380]
I mean, the one Al Goldstein had, I never had one.

[02:39:36.500 --> 02:39:37.420]
Al Goldstein's got it.

[02:39:37.420 --> 02:39:38.980]
I thought you had one because I know you're...

[02:39:38.980 --> 02:39:40.360]
I used to know your neighbors were well...

[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:41.040]
That uh...

[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:42.040]
That was to the north of you.

[02:39:42.980 --> 02:39:43.620]
Tom Crowder.

[02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:45.120]
I have no idea.

[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:45.640]
Oh.

[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:46.800]
I had a Pop Belly pig.

[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:47.600]
I never had a pig.

[02:39:47.900 --> 02:39:49.420]
I thought it was very fun in the house.

[02:39:49.900 --> 02:39:50.280]
Oh, okay.

[02:39:50.580 --> 02:39:50.900]
No.

[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:52.740]
Okay, well, can I call somebody a...

[02:39:52.740 --> 02:39:53.320]
A D-bag?

[02:39:53.480 --> 02:39:53.700]
No.

[02:39:54.820 --> 02:39:55.600]
Oh, my God.

[02:39:55.700 --> 02:39:57.320]
We have an open line in Broward to and Dade.

[02:39:57.460 --> 02:40:01.560]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty, and pound five, sixty on the 18 T wireless line.

[02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:02.360]
Was that cute or what?

[02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:02.960]
Was that the...

[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:03.080]
No.

[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:03.720]
No, not really.

[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:04.660]
That was pathetic.

[02:40:04.660 --> 02:40:06.140]
Here's a mobile avid chura.

[02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:06.440]
Hello.

[02:40:06.900 --> 02:40:07.940]
Hey, and you know how's it going?

[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:08.400]
Okay, sir.

[02:40:08.740 --> 02:40:09.700]
Hey, I want to tell you something.

[02:40:09.820 --> 02:40:14.000]
Every time I hear that bit with the lotion and the basket and the cosmetic surgeon,

[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.360]
no matter how many times I hear it, I still laugh my ass off.

[02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:18.440]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:19.140]
Yeah, it really does.

[02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:20.380]
Let me have a look at it.

[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:20.580]
Let me have a look at it.

[02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:26.400]
It's hot to use the only sport where you can really get into the game if you're there.

[02:40:26.840 --> 02:40:29.580]
You know, like as far as like baseball TV is kind of boring.

[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:30.660]
It's a football, it's all right.

[02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:31.140]
Yeah.

[02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:35.340]
But it's constantly the only sport where you really get more out of it by going to the game.

[02:40:36.380 --> 02:40:38.020]
I think that's true with any game.

[02:40:38.180 --> 02:40:39.140]
Why would you say that?

[02:40:39.420 --> 02:40:40.340]
Although football, I don't know.

[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:41.740]
Football is perfect for television.

[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:44.180]
I gave up after about five years of it.

[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:48.680]
I gave up going over the dolphin games because it just suited for television better.

[02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:50.940]
I'll be honest with you.

[02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:54.520]
When you go to a professional football game, depending on where you're sitting,

[02:40:55.080 --> 02:40:57.340]
it almost looks like a high school sporting event.

[02:40:57.460 --> 02:40:58.040]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:40:58.040 --> 02:41:03.800]
Yeah, it doesn't have the same excitement or the same drama in person as it does when you're watching on TV.

[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:07.200]
Football, in fact, television may be, and I felt what it is today.

[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:11.100]
Yeah, I went through the Bronco game and I was actually on the field and actually had to that.

[02:41:11.180 --> 02:41:12.600]
I smoked a cigarette with Larry Little.

[02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:13.180]
Yeah.

[02:41:13.500 --> 02:41:14.880]
Number 66 with a whole thing.

[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:15.240]
Yeah.

[02:41:15.580 --> 02:41:17.380]
And I was pretty impressed with that.

[02:41:17.540 --> 02:41:19.040]
But let me ask you a question on something.

[02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:24.000]
Why is it that only people who go to the game to watch the fights never understand the game?

[02:41:25.260 --> 02:41:30.140]
Well, you answered your own question to a theoretical question because if that's the only reason you go,

[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:31.600]
that means you don't understand the sport.

[02:41:31.820 --> 02:41:35.580]
But why is hockey going to sport where they can fight except for boxing, of course?

[02:41:36.060 --> 02:41:36.180]
Yeah.

[02:41:36.780 --> 02:41:39.540]
Why don't they have balls and they don't have balls in baseball?

[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:42.000]
Well, but you get ejected.

[02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:44.840]
I mean, here you get a couple of men of penalties come back in the game.

[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:47.060]
Well, because it's a much more physical game.

[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:51.360]
They're not, you know, they don't go back and hold hands in the title like they do in football, you know.

[02:41:51.540 --> 02:41:52.440]
Yeah, more physical.

[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:53.220]
All right.

[02:41:53.300 --> 02:41:53.660]
Thank you.

[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:54.040]
Okay.

[02:41:54.140 --> 02:41:54.720]
Have a great day, pal.

[02:41:55.020 --> 02:41:59.680]
It's a real man sport hockey is supposed to football, which is basically a panty sport.

[02:42:00.060 --> 02:42:03.060]
Everybody knows that anybody watching those guys holding hands in the huddle.

[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:04.700]
That's a great club you moron.

[02:42:04.780 --> 02:42:06.400]
We have an open line in Broward to indeed.

[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:07.340]
5, 6, 7.

[02:42:07.400 --> 02:42:09.320]
I mean, they were those real tight pants.

[02:42:09.420 --> 02:42:12.420]
You know, and they're grabbing each other around the crouching, they're rolling around in the mud together.

[02:42:12.660 --> 02:42:13.780]
I mean, what do you call it?

[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:15.380]
That's a great club you moron.

[02:42:15.380 --> 02:42:19.840]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:42:20.180 --> 02:42:23.120]
Quarterback comes up, puts his hand under the center's record.

[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:24.280]
I mean, what is that?

[02:42:24.620 --> 02:42:28.620]
What kind of a thing is that one guy comes up and sticks his hand under another guy's ass?

[02:42:29.220 --> 02:42:29.860]
What do you call it?

[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:31.520]
That's a great club you moron.

[02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:37.780]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line as we're coming to a bitter conclusion today.

[02:42:37.900 --> 02:42:38.460]
I can smell it.

[02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:40.180]
Here's a mobile in western.

[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:40.500]
Hello.

[02:42:41.140 --> 02:42:41.820]
Hey, Neil.

[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:42.360]
Yes, sir.

[02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:44.000]
I agree.

[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:46.580]
Everything you're saying about a little bubble out there on the ice.

[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:51.260]
But what kind of captain do you feel it's got in the middle of me?

[02:42:51.260 --> 02:42:51.840]
Meaning what?

[02:42:52.740 --> 02:42:54.520]
I don't think he does nothing for the team.

[02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:56.220]
Okay, well, I'm real happy to hear that.

[02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:57.040]
See, there you go.

[02:42:57.180 --> 02:42:58.840]
There's a guy, another one of the original team.

[02:42:59.020 --> 02:43:02.020]
A guy that really goes out there digs and works and gives it his all.

[02:43:02.260 --> 02:43:03.560]
And this guy's talking to trying to keep him.

[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:04.360]
See what I'm saying?

[02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:07.600]
Okay, one call left on the board.

[02:43:07.740 --> 02:43:09.240]
We suddenly hit a brick wall here, baby.

[02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:12.500]
We were rolling along yesterday for a Monday spectacular today.

[02:43:12.540 --> 02:43:13.280]
Pretty damn good.

[02:43:13.340 --> 02:43:15.760]
And now all of a sudden it's like, oh my god.

[02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:17.520]
So that mentioned about that gigantic animal.

[02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:18.800]
They all drove to the Golden Glades.

[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:19.560]
Where do we sign up?

[02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:25.600]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:28.680]
139,502 for center one.

[02:43:28.840 --> 02:43:30.620]
We're definitely going over 140 grand.

[02:43:30.700 --> 02:43:31.940]
We're going to break the record this year.

[02:43:32.060 --> 02:43:32.860]
Thank you, everybody.

[02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:33.580]
You helped us out.

[02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:36.600]
And thanks to once for doing a spectacular job.

[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:39.720]
And thanks to Sam and Chris and everybody in the WhatsApp name.

[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:40.580]
What was his name?

[02:43:40.700 --> 02:43:41.200]
The other guy, Lou?

[02:43:42.780 --> 02:43:43.100]
Yes.

[02:43:43.620 --> 02:43:45.280]
Who helped us with the Q&M van out there.

[02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:46.820]
We were able to travel thousands doing that every day.

[02:43:47.060 --> 02:43:48.040]
Got a phenomenal total.

[02:43:48.220 --> 02:43:48.760]
Really nice going.

[02:43:49.320 --> 02:43:50.280]
And next year you know what I'm thinking?

[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:51.860]
Well, I'll tell you off the air.

[02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:54.980]
So seriously, we could do a thing with the Phil Henry deal.

[02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:56.100]
We could make a deal with Phil.

[02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:58.900]
Where we would like in the spring.

[02:43:59.780 --> 02:44:02.980]
Make available a certain number of his CDs for their charity out there.

[02:44:02.980 --> 02:44:07.760]
If we were able to take like a similar number and pedal them for center one in the fall.

[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:10.840]
And raise yourself another 20 or 30 grand.

[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:11.420]
That sounds good.

[02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:13.920]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:44:14.020 --> 02:44:14.240]
Hello.

[02:44:16.140 --> 02:44:17.160]
Mobile in Miami.

[02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:19.560]
Have a nice life.

[02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:20.040]
Okay.

[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:20.880]
Another coward.

[02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:22.600]
Mobile in for Lauderdale.

[02:44:22.660 --> 02:44:22.840]
Hello.

[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:24.440]
Yes, sir.

[02:44:24.940 --> 02:44:25.280]
Hi, Neil.

[02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:29.740]
I bought a 94 Corvette convertible two years ago.

[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:33.520]
And lastly, I bought it for 27,000.

[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:33.700]
Yeah.

[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:36.760]
Last week I traded the car in.

[02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:40.980]
The dealer gave me 26,000 on a new 99 convertible.

[02:44:41.020 --> 02:44:41.520]
And you like that?

[02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:42.880]
It is incredible.

[02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:43.980]
The car.

[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:44.940]
Oh, it's a big one.

[02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:48.040]
Now the 99 is just I love my 99.

[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:49.460]
I'm just obsessed with this car.

[02:44:49.500 --> 02:44:50.620]
This car is so blind.

[02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:51.680]
I got a natural blue.

[02:44:51.980 --> 02:44:52.160]
Yeah.

[02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:54.260]
And it's just the car does everything.

[02:44:54.480 --> 02:44:55.440]
I got the pewter.

[02:44:56.640 --> 02:44:57.520]
Incredible cars.

[02:44:57.640 --> 02:44:57.780]
Yeah.

[02:44:58.320 --> 02:44:59.360]
Absolutely incredible car.

[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:02.240]
Why anybody who can afford a Corvette,

[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:04.180]
we go out and spend twice as much money

[02:45:04.180 --> 02:45:06.940]
for some stupid ass expensive sports car

[02:45:06.940 --> 02:45:07.980]
that makes a lot of noise

[02:45:07.980 --> 02:45:10.500]
and that requires all kinds of real expensive repairs.

[02:45:10.860 --> 02:45:11.360]
I don't get it.

[02:45:12.060 --> 02:45:13.580]
It doesn't really look very good.

[02:45:14.060 --> 02:45:15.880]
I drove the 94 for two years.

[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:16.420]
Yeah.

[02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:18.560]
And I got basically what I paid for it.

[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.440]
And I bought this car and had a thousand miles on it.

[02:45:21.500 --> 02:45:22.640]
It had been titled once before.

[02:45:22.860 --> 02:45:23.000]
Right.

[02:45:23.580 --> 02:45:25.940]
And I saved about 8,000 off of sticker.

[02:45:26.060 --> 02:45:26.340]
Beautiful.

[02:45:27.240 --> 02:45:29.220]
And when I sold a car in two or three years,

[02:45:29.380 --> 02:45:31.180]
I'll probably get back close to what I paid.

[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:33.080]
And the thing scares the heck out of you.

[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:34.180]
When you push that pedal down,

[02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:35.680]
it was just incredible.

[02:45:35.800 --> 02:45:35.920]
Right.

[02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:37.420]
Hey, thanks again.

[02:45:37.540 --> 02:45:38.320]
God bless you, sir.

[02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:39.600]
I drive it in good health.

[02:45:39.980 --> 02:45:41.740]
We have an open line and Broward to and date.

[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:44.100]
Any interest here this last part of the show?

[02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:44.320]
No.

[02:45:44.580 --> 02:45:46.020]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:49.240]
Pound 5, 60 on the AT&T Warrows line.

[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:51.540]
Trace them a little bit today.

[02:45:51.560 --> 02:45:52.740]
A little bit too much hockey talk.

[02:45:52.740 --> 02:45:54.280]
I keep saying I'm never going to do this again.

[02:45:54.280 --> 02:45:55.800]
But after last night's experience,

[02:45:55.800 --> 02:45:57.940]
which I just cannot understand these people.

[02:45:57.940 --> 02:46:00.780]
And I especially can't understand the inconsiderate people.

[02:46:00.900 --> 02:46:02.900]
And yes, I will keep talking about you on the year

[02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:05.780]
until you stop pulling the same craft every time you show up there.

[02:46:05.900 --> 02:46:06.100]
Okay.

[02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:09.880]
Over and over and over again.

[02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:10.280]
You're inconsiderate.

[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:12.380]
You're obnoxious is what you are.

[02:46:12.460 --> 02:46:12.700]
Okay.

[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:14.260]
I don't give a crap who you are.

[02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:17.860]
If your conversations are so goddamn important

[02:46:17.860 --> 02:46:19.380]
and earth shocking,

[02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:21.500]
then go out into goddamn lobby and have them.

[02:46:21.740 --> 02:46:22.960]
Go into T-Roman have them.

[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:25.080]
And let the rest of us,

[02:46:25.220 --> 02:46:27.360]
let the 100 or 200 of us who are in that joys,

[02:46:27.460 --> 02:46:28.620]
who are appreciates the game.

[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:30.500]
Let us see what's going on out there, okay?

[02:46:32.280 --> 02:46:34.760]
I didn't invest my long two and a half or three minute drive

[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:36.080]
all the way from my house to the arena,

[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:38.180]
so I could sit there and watch the back of somebody's head.

[02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:42.160]
Here's a mobile in North Miami Beach.

[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:42.380]
Hello.

[02:46:42.880 --> 02:46:43.440]
Hello, Neil.

[02:46:43.600 --> 02:46:43.960]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:44.420 --> 02:46:47.100]
Yeah, this is the guy from, I called you a while back

[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:49.420]
in San Luis Obispo, remember?

[02:46:49.680 --> 02:46:49.860]
No.

[02:46:49.860 --> 02:46:54.660]
Well, last year it was and I ordered some CDs from you.

[02:46:54.860 --> 02:46:55.000]
Yeah.

[02:46:55.160 --> 02:46:57.580]
I'm here in town now and listening to the show.

[02:46:58.100 --> 02:47:00.460]
And I wanted to tell you a thing happened

[02:47:01.260 --> 02:47:04.720]
with a guy on a, on a merit online.

[02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:05.360]
Yeah.

[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:09.500]
I put in one of my screen names that I was selling

[02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:10.740]
synthetic shammies.

[02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:15.260]
And the guy wrote me back from some place called Florida Natural

[02:47:15.260 --> 02:47:19.160]
and he says that I had no right whatsoever to use the word

[02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:22.240]
chamie, the HA M O I S.

[02:47:22.460 --> 02:47:22.660]
Yeah.

[02:47:23.060 --> 02:47:26.120]
And that word's in the dictionary and he says he's got a copy right

[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:27.320]
on the name.

[02:47:27.760 --> 02:47:27.960]
Yeah.

[02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:29.100]
So I wrote him an actual copy.

[02:47:29.100 --> 02:47:31.040]
Ask him if he's got a copy right on the name douchebag,

[02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:32.040]
see if he knows that one.

[02:47:32.300 --> 02:47:33.880]
I'm going to, I'm going to ask him that.

[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:36.500]
But anyway, I just wanted to tell you that I've been

[02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:38.340]
playing your show since I got here.

[02:47:38.440 --> 02:47:40.400]
I'm a regional, I live in California.

[02:47:42.020 --> 02:47:44.980]
And I ordered your CDs last year and I'm going to,

[02:47:44.980 --> 02:47:46.780]
I'm going to get the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

[02:47:46.780 --> 02:47:47.580]
okay. And thank you so much.

[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:49.600]
You have a great life and a good luck with that personality

[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:50.080]
transplant.

[02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:52.460]
We have an open line in the two of men day five six seven,

[02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:55.520]
they sounded like a, a little like him five six seven,

[02:47:55.520 --> 02:47:58.600]
oh five 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:00.540]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:00.880]
Hello.

[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:01.840]
Hello.

[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:02.540]
Yes, sir.

[02:48:02.900 --> 02:48:05.460]
Yeah, Neil, I say, like, say, I listen to you every day.

[02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:06.380]
I really love your show.

[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:09.500]
One thing you talked about a while back when these basketball players

[02:48:09.500 --> 02:48:10.700]
have to agree 100%.

[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:13.220]
I hope they don't pay on one red cent.

[02:48:13.900 --> 02:48:18.400]
I think they're overpaid and I really don't have any sympathy for them.

[02:48:18.420 --> 02:48:18.660]
Yeah.

[02:48:18.860 --> 02:48:21.540]
And, uh, and I really appreciate the job that you're doing, Neil.

[02:48:21.900 --> 02:48:23.840]
And if you've got a chance, can you play that Buffalo Bill song?

[02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:24.440]
No.

[02:48:25.460 --> 02:48:28.060]
Oh, the, but he always talking about the, I thought he was talking about Buffalo Bill,

[02:48:28.060 --> 02:48:28.820]
our Buffalo Bill.

[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:30.100]
He's talking about Phil Henry.

[02:48:30.220 --> 02:48:30.920]
What's that call?

[02:48:32.420 --> 02:48:32.840]
The bill.

[02:48:32.980 --> 02:48:33.720]
I know what it's called.

[02:48:33.860 --> 02:48:36.140]
This stalling, having you learned by now with a, uh,

[02:48:37.100 --> 02:48:39.700]
stall artist I am sitting on the stall.

[02:48:39.820 --> 02:48:41.860]
Well, Buffalo has a football team.

[02:48:41.860 --> 02:48:43.820]
The greatest in the land.

[02:48:43.940 --> 02:48:46.300]
Man, everybody thinks they're great.

[02:48:46.660 --> 02:48:48.160]
I say really hard.

[02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:49.440]
The Buffalo Bill.

[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:50.540]
I don't know what that's all I want.

[02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:51.220]
See what I mean?

[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:53.060]
So just sing along.

[02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:54.620]
When you say my amnesty.

[02:48:54.740 --> 02:48:56.440]
When you say Buffalo Super Bowl.

[02:48:56.540 --> 02:48:58.860]
And here's that Buffalo Bells.

[02:49:00.860 --> 02:49:01.940]
Buffalo Bells.

[02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:05.360]
Degraded team in the history of human race.

[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:05.780]
Degraded team in the history of human race.

[02:49:05.780 --> 02:49:08.120]
That's Buffalo Bells.

[02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:09.500]
Degraded team.

[02:49:10.860 --> 02:49:12.920]
Inflized bread and canned beer.

[02:49:14.820 --> 02:49:16.040]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:49:16.460 --> 02:49:18.800]
And you're, and you're jazzed up that redneck stuff.

[02:49:18.940 --> 02:49:20.140]
Listen to that banjo.

[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:22.540]
Holy sweet god listen to that.

[02:49:22.780 --> 02:49:25.640]
When you say Buffalo Bill's, it don't sound so redneck.

[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:26.160]
You do it.

[02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:29.340]
Everybody sing along now.

[02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:30.420]
Are you Bill fan?

[02:49:30.700 --> 02:49:31.180]
Here we go.

[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:35.520]
Where's the Buffalo Bill's are the best teams?

[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:37.760]
They have the best record over the last five years.

[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:40.140]
We can't wait to the Super Bowl for a hard time.

[02:49:40.260 --> 02:49:42.740]
Which is more than I can say for this scum second season.

[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:44.100]
And they're at the greatest.

[02:49:44.420 --> 02:49:46.420]
Because they really like their uniforms.

[02:49:46.780 --> 02:49:49.800]
They share his hellbeat the heck out of having a fish.

[02:49:49.940 --> 02:49:53.400]
Y'all the hell, because they're not Buffalo Whole Bells.

[02:49:53.620 --> 02:49:55.340]
The best football teams.

[02:49:55.880 --> 02:49:59.080]
What I ever seen in the history of my life.

[02:49:59.180 --> 02:50:02.260]
They are the Buffalo Bells.

[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:04.140]
The Buffalo Bells.

[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:06.900]
The whole of Jim Kelly, the greatest quarter back in the league.

[02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:08.820]
Yeah, everybody.

[02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:10.780]
That Buffalo Bells.

[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:12.900]
That's a Buffalo Bells.

[02:50:13.260 --> 02:50:16.360]
And they've been around longer than the stinkin' rotten fish.

[02:50:16.660 --> 02:50:19.380]
Well, that's a Buffalo Bells.

[02:50:19.500 --> 02:50:20.900]
Buffalo Bells.

[02:50:21.760 --> 02:50:24.180]
What would you rather have as a pet a Buffalo or a fish?

[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:26.820]
Okay, 126 and 560 WGQAM.

[02:50:27.340 --> 02:50:29.880]
We have 72 open lines in date, 400 and broard.

[02:50:29.980 --> 02:50:33.760]
567, 05, 60, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:35.300]
Don't forget that micron PC bowl.

[02:50:35.300 --> 02:50:36.380]
The night anybody's gonna be watching.

[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:37.220]
It's gonna be listening.

[02:50:37.260 --> 02:50:37.940]
It's gonna be there.

[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:39.360]
Okay, thank you.

[02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:41.660]
Then, so, get away from the ball, motherfucker.

[02:50:42.880 --> 02:50:44.080]
Car theft is on the rocks.

[02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:47.500]
In America, a car was stolen every 12 seconds.

[02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:49.560]
What can you do to protect your car?

[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:53.740]
An expensive car alarm system won't protect your car from being stolen.

[02:50:54.280 --> 02:50:56.980]
The club won't protect the valuables inside your car.

[02:50:57.540 --> 02:50:59.980]
But a big black guy named Ben Kamp.

[02:51:00.180 --> 02:51:01.700]
You don't worry from the car, motherfucker.

[02:51:02.560 --> 02:51:05.380]
Or less than you'd pay for an expensive car alarm system.

[02:51:05.740 --> 02:51:07.420]
And even less than you'd pay for the club,

[02:51:07.700 --> 02:51:11.420]
you can get a big black guy named Ben to protect your automobile.

[02:51:11.880 --> 02:51:13.340]
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

[02:51:14.380 --> 02:51:15.480]
It's simple to use.

[02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:19.500]
Just leave the big black guy named Ben in your car whenever you get out.

[02:51:19.900 --> 02:51:21.040]
And he does the rest.

[02:51:21.420 --> 02:51:26.120]
Whenever anyone gets within six feet of your car, Ben simply gets out of the car and tells them.

[02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:27.620]
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

[02:51:27.620 --> 02:51:33.060]
Listen to these testimonials from people who use a big black guy named Ben.

[02:51:33.260 --> 02:51:37.200]
It's always nice to have someone to ride with, although he really doesn't say much.

[02:51:37.540 --> 02:51:39.100]
Just get away from the car, motherfucker.

[02:51:40.980 --> 02:51:41.720]
That's about it.

[02:51:42.280 --> 02:51:44.760]
I didn't get a big black guy named Ben to chat with.

[02:51:45.220 --> 02:51:46.480]
He got him to protect my car.

[02:51:47.020 --> 02:51:49.020]
It's the best investment I've ever made.

[02:51:49.660 --> 02:51:51.040]
My name of it isn't that great.

[02:51:51.560 --> 02:51:53.100]
There have been a lot of car thefts.

[02:51:53.340 --> 02:51:56.880]
I can't tell you how many times I've tried to get away from the car, motherfucker.

[02:51:57.420 --> 02:52:01.980]
Knowing that I've got a big black guy named Ben, protecting my car, let's me sleep better at night.

[02:52:02.440 --> 02:52:02.860]
Calm down.

[02:52:03.200 --> 02:52:04.880]
1-800-1 big guy.

[02:52:05.240 --> 02:52:07.880]
That's 1-800-1-BIG-GUI.

[02:52:08.820 --> 02:52:13.520]
And instead of hearing this, you'll hear this.

[02:52:13.840 --> 02:52:15.340]
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

[02:52:15.820 --> 02:52:17.740]
Thank you 1-30-560-WDQM.

[02:52:17.800 --> 02:52:19.080]
I'm going to save these two other things.

[02:52:19.220 --> 02:52:23.880]
This Howard Beal column about Channel 4, which is falling apart with the seams and how they suck and loosen their ass.

[02:52:24.360 --> 02:52:26.220]
The other one about the...

[02:52:26.740 --> 02:52:29.300]
The dancing, the happy people, the history of the football dancing.

[02:52:29.760 --> 02:52:30.360]
They'd be doing it.

[02:52:30.420 --> 02:52:30.960]
They'd be styling.

[02:52:31.060 --> 02:52:32.000]
They'd be a jukin' and jive.

[02:52:32.080 --> 02:52:33.480]
Don't there's that ball hitting the bokeh brine?

[02:52:34.120 --> 02:52:36.080]
I shouldn't only show up now that I brought him some cash.

[02:52:37.180 --> 02:52:38.980]
We have an open line in Broward, all three in date.

[02:52:39.220 --> 02:52:43.220]
5-6705-60 and 0.560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:52:43.260 --> 02:52:46.740]
We're coming to a very bitter pill to swallow in here today.

[02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:49.060]
I wonder what that's all about, huh?

[02:52:49.220 --> 02:52:50.520]
You think it's that pure real stuff?

[02:52:50.720 --> 02:52:52.720]
Yeah, I think that they wouldn't know who now he is.

[02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:55.000]
Including the people that we're cheering and carrying on.

[02:52:55.060 --> 02:52:56.060]
They also don't know who he is.

[02:52:56.800 --> 02:52:57.680]
Here's a pompe-no.

[02:52:58.400 --> 02:52:58.400]

[02:52:58.580 --> 02:52:59.540]
Good afternoon, Uncle.

[02:52:59.600 --> 02:52:59.900]
Neil, welcome.

[02:52:59.900 --> 02:53:00.220]
Yes, sir.

[02:53:01.840 --> 02:53:03.960]
You're right about the fans in the arena.

[02:53:04.260 --> 02:53:05.460]
We've talked about this before.

[02:53:05.820 --> 02:53:10.640]
I had the occasion of evening to sit up in one of the automobile dealers' suite.

[02:53:12.020 --> 02:53:13.820]
And you know, right below us is Club level.

[02:53:14.060 --> 02:53:21.720]
And these jerks are standing up just waving at the screen and waving at the time I had to put my hand on a guy's shoulder and say...

[02:53:22.540 --> 02:53:23.160]
Sit down.

[02:53:23.440 --> 02:53:23.580]
Yeah.

[02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:25.160]
You know, put your ass in the seat.

[02:53:25.360 --> 02:53:28.020]
And you know, regarding the knowledge of the fans,

[02:53:28.740 --> 02:53:31.320]
Gune, I grew up and we learned the game in the same way.

[02:53:31.820 --> 02:53:32.780]
Hockey night in Canada.

[02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:33.340]
Mm-hmm.

[02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:33.780]
Okay?

[02:53:34.180 --> 02:53:34.380]
Yeah.

[02:53:34.400 --> 02:53:36.260]
I can't one of these TV stations here.

[02:53:36.380 --> 02:53:39.120]
Butch up, roll a pair, and bring us Hockey night in Canada.

[02:53:39.120 --> 02:53:43.600]
Because there's no hockey fans that are well, if you get yourself a small dish and stop being defeated.

[02:53:43.600 --> 02:53:44.080]
I have it.

[02:53:44.280 --> 02:53:44.920]
Well, there you go.

[02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:47.880]
I have it, but I'm talking about the fans who don't know the game.

[02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:49.820]
We've learned the game of the athletes.

[02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:52.340]
You know, you're missing the point.

[02:53:52.340 --> 02:53:54.580]
The fact is that it's very easy.

[02:53:54.640 --> 02:53:55.420]
It's very simple.

[02:53:55.560 --> 02:54:00.000]
If you want to make the effort, if you want to go there and watch the game or if you want to watch my television,

[02:54:00.340 --> 02:54:02.980]
all 82 Panther games are on television this season.

[02:54:03.260 --> 02:54:04.780]
That's the sixth year we've had it here.

[02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:06.400]
There's nothing difficult about it.

[02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:07.220]
It's exciting.

[02:54:07.480 --> 02:54:08.140]
It's cintillating.

[02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:08.640]
It's great.

[02:54:08.840 --> 02:54:11.860]
Although quite frankly, most of the games we play this year aren't so exciting as cintillating.

[02:54:12.140 --> 02:54:12.940]
It's like last night.

[02:54:13.260 --> 02:54:15.940]
Two-thirds of the game was spent like in La La land.

[02:54:15.940 --> 02:54:19.660]
It was about five or six or seven minutes there at various parts.

[02:54:19.880 --> 02:54:21.600]
They're like back and forth like a real hockey game.

[02:54:21.980 --> 02:54:23.500]
Most of them have been coma affairs.

[02:54:23.820 --> 02:54:26.220]
But if you really want to learn it, these people don't care.

[02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:27.360]
They don't have that much of an interest.

[02:54:27.680 --> 02:54:29.040]
It's just a social event.

[02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:30.240]
It's a place to go.

[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:31.200]
It's something to do.

[02:54:31.320 --> 02:54:32.300]
You're absolutely right.

[02:54:32.420 --> 02:54:33.340]
They have no interest.

[02:54:33.900 --> 02:54:36.660]
You should see the people up there in that family's lounge.

[02:54:38.120 --> 02:54:38.260]
Yeah.

[02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:40.080]
And they're just like sitting around.

[02:54:40.340 --> 02:54:42.700]
And I'm running to get back to my seat.

[02:54:42.700 --> 02:54:45.340]
You know, and they're just sitting there.

[02:54:45.420 --> 02:54:46.700]
Hey, listen, you can go out there.

[02:54:46.780 --> 02:54:50.760]
When I, you know, what was as soon as the TV time out, life comes out in a little pink light.

[02:54:50.920 --> 02:54:52.360]
I run out if I have to take a leak.

[02:54:52.540 --> 02:54:56.840]
And if you could see the thousands of people that are milling around out there in the middle of a period,

[02:54:56.840 --> 02:54:58.560]
while the game is going on, they don't care.

[02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:00.720]
Hang out.

[02:55:00.940 --> 02:55:02.320]
Have a good one, I'll call me back to you.

[02:55:02.500 --> 02:55:02.800]
Take care.

[02:55:03.620 --> 02:55:04.580]
It's just this guy.

[02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:05.620]
He doesn't understand.

[02:55:05.820 --> 02:55:07.220]
He's from a hockey player.

[02:55:07.220 --> 02:55:09.620]
This is not a hockey player.

[02:55:09.860 --> 02:55:10.040]
Is it?

[02:55:10.060 --> 02:55:12.300]
No, no, no, no.

[02:55:12.820 --> 02:55:15.540]
No, no, no, no.

[02:55:15.980 --> 02:55:16.340]
No, no, no, no.

[02:55:16.340 --> 02:55:17.040]
Oh, no.

[02:55:17.100 --> 02:55:18.320]
Oh, no, no, no.

[02:55:18.860 --> 02:55:21.360]
No, no, no.

[02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:22.400]
That's it all.

[02:55:22.800 --> 02:55:23.580]
Shut up.

[02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:24.100]
Shut up.

[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:26.700]
We don't care.

[02:55:26.900 --> 02:55:27.700]
They don't want to know.

[02:55:27.940 --> 02:55:32.260]
There are no hockey fans, it's like looking for a needle in the goddamn haystack, right?

[02:55:32.320 --> 02:55:32.540]
Yes.

[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:35.280]
Open line in the Broward Too and Dave.

hello yes sir

[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:45.660]
oh i've well i was a weird connection

[02:55:45.660 --> 02:55:49.260]
uh... yeah i have a thing to plan about no matter where you go down here

[02:55:49.260 --> 02:55:50.140]
for sports

[02:55:50.140 --> 02:55:53.640]
the people just love to stand up in front of you understand that they're

[02:55:53.640 --> 02:55:56.640]
ruled their inconsiderate they don't care about it whether anybody else

[02:55:56.640 --> 02:55:58.260]
can see it back there but they're probably

[02:55:58.260 --> 02:56:01.380]
in sense over the fact that there's always a bunch of actually want to see

[02:56:01.380 --> 02:56:02.460]
what's going on out there

[02:56:02.460 --> 02:56:04.620]
although they're ready to fight with you over it

[02:56:04.620 --> 02:56:08.520]
i i i went to that uh... now i don't know any football game but what is the

[02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:09.140]
devor game

[02:56:09.140 --> 02:56:10.620]
uh... the other night yeah

[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:12.760]
and uh...

[02:56:12.760 --> 02:56:14.060]
same problem that the guys

[02:56:14.060 --> 02:56:17.440]
like four of them stand up every single play

[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:20.880]
and they're encouraging everybody out the round them to stand up to

[02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:23.740]
uh... i don't understand that

[02:56:23.740 --> 02:56:26.060]
well i think i'll maybe a little bit too much tailgating

[02:56:26.700 --> 02:56:27.480]
problem that okay

[02:56:27.480 --> 02:56:30.120]
well one of those money night games you know that's for sure

[02:56:31.140 --> 02:56:31.580]
uh...

[02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:35.500]
the funny thing i heard the other day uh... when you were doing uh... just

[02:56:35.500 --> 02:56:37.720]
you were playing all the different cards what had you know

[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:41.240]
uh... i didn't realize that uh...

[02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:45.760]
the jewish real jewish man named i said the car warning system for the actual

[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:49.500]
phone call oh sure i actually called in we made him into a star that's right

[02:56:50.120 --> 02:56:51.000]
that was the best

[02:56:51.460 --> 02:56:53.560]
that's why i guess i

[02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:54.720]
i would like to hear

[02:56:54.720 --> 02:56:58.100]
that phone call again if you get an opportunity to play that you mean the original

[02:56:58.100 --> 02:56:58.500]
thing

[02:56:58.500 --> 02:57:01.000]
yeah i i i i i i i i would prefer to have a heart

[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:02.900]
i can't believe somebody actually

[02:57:02.900 --> 02:57:04.400]
talk that way

[02:57:05.260 --> 02:57:07.600]
i heard a uh... commercial

[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:09.040]
on your station

[02:57:09.040 --> 02:57:12.580]
yesterday about one o'clock in the afternoon

[02:57:13.340 --> 02:57:16.240]
something about uh...

[02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:18.500]
a voice would uh... speak out

[02:57:19.460 --> 02:57:22.540]
if someone approaches your uh... automobile

[02:57:23.100 --> 02:57:27.100]
and i'd be a voice of a big black something rather

[02:57:27.660 --> 02:57:28.480]
would come out

[02:57:28.480 --> 02:57:29.500]
and say

[02:57:29.500 --> 02:57:31.280]
get away from my

[02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:32.020]
automobile

[02:57:32.740 --> 02:57:35.100]
or you're too close to my automobile

[02:57:35.900 --> 02:57:36.620]
you beg

[02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:37.700]
mf

[02:57:37.700 --> 02:57:39.860]
i object seriously

[02:57:41.340 --> 02:57:43.120]
profanity like that

[02:57:43.740 --> 02:57:48.600]
on on the radio and i i object to the

[02:57:49.180 --> 02:57:49.980]
profanity

[02:57:49.980 --> 02:57:52.080]
and that type of advertising

[02:57:52.080 --> 02:57:55.340]
i believe in free speech but that's too far

[02:57:55.340 --> 02:57:56.360]
i don't hear

[02:57:56.360 --> 02:57:57.160]

federal communications commission

[02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:06.980]
because no kind of that kind of language

[02:58:07.500 --> 02:58:10.220]
is certainly not acceptable on on

[02:58:11.060 --> 02:58:12.000]
public radio

[02:58:12.660 --> 02:58:15.000]
it might be alright between individuals

not on the radio

[02:58:17.340 --> 02:58:19.240]

and i'll put it up to happy quanza

[03:00:03.520 --> 03:00:06.980]
and i'm just kind of curious is that why are we endorsing this

[03:00:07.640 --> 03:00:10.900]
well what we endorsing it why that i don't even know what it is i know it's a

[03:00:10.900 --> 03:00:14.360]
black it's an african holiday what what is it i mean i don't like how it is

[03:00:14.360 --> 03:00:16.320]
my understanding is that the african christmas

[03:00:16.320 --> 03:00:16.620]
yeah

[03:00:16.620 --> 03:00:19.000]
and well let me ask you're we in africa

[03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:22.760]
well so what's what's what's it's called more pandering the herald is the

[03:00:22.760 --> 03:00:24.480]
greatest pan to run the face of the year

[03:00:25.020 --> 03:00:27.280]
i i agree with you i just it's really

[03:00:27.700 --> 03:00:31.400]
ruined my morning because you know we we endorse the week we were right when

[03:00:31.400 --> 03:00:34.640]
i wake up on the fifth of may every right i don't pick up the sun settle on

[03:00:34.640 --> 03:00:36.380]
the front page they happy single the mile

[03:00:36.380 --> 03:00:42.060]
i i i i know i don't care who you are what color what

[03:00:42.060 --> 03:00:45.940]
yeah as long as your productive member of the city it's called divide and

[03:00:45.940 --> 03:00:49.900]
conquer divide and conquer it's partly a whole establishment game plan in this

[03:00:49.900 --> 03:00:54.060]
country is to compartmentalize the country and do a especially with minorities

[03:00:54.060 --> 03:00:57.100]
like blacks is to convince them that all of a sudden they're not really

[03:00:57.100 --> 03:01:00.660]
american their africans they have a separate culture they have a separate

[03:01:00.660 --> 03:01:05.080]
language they got ebonics and bubonics it's all a bunch of bullcrap i i told

[03:01:05.080 --> 03:01:08.600]
garbage i i agree with you know i said it's and that's why brought up this thing

[03:01:08.600 --> 03:01:11.820]
yesterday about uh you know i don't want to single it like Lamar Thomas i mean

[03:01:11.820 --> 03:01:15.180]
he's just one of many all these guys these black athletes that go out there

[03:01:15.180 --> 03:01:19.120]
and and it's embarrassing it's humiliating it sets racial relations back a

[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:22.440]
hundred years and even on most white people would lie to you and tell you oh

[03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:25.960]
it's entertaining he's and it's not entertaining it's embarrassing it's a

[03:01:25.960 --> 03:01:29.120]
jibass nigger thing to do and that's what america's sitting back and thinking

[03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:33.380]
when they see that i'm not entertaining about it yeah but i wonder why more people

[03:01:33.380 --> 03:01:36.960]
don't stand up i mean because most people are cowards for the same reason

[03:01:36.960 --> 03:01:39.960]
that most people won't tell you they don't believe in god they know it's a bunch of

[03:01:39.960 --> 03:01:42.960]
bullcrap they're scared as hell to die because they know that when they die

[03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:46.440]
they go in the ground and they rot they're not going to tell you that oh the lord

[03:01:46.440 --> 03:01:50.100]
often having the pearly gates tell him a bunch of crap like that the pearly gates

we're not going to renew you and then rick rally came in and carried on like a petal and child

and he factures the guy back and while we put the uh best the strongest act we've got in the morning

[03:04:29.160 --> 03:04:32.860]
that's why we're putting rick and suds on it and this is the same guy that was going to blow him out

[03:04:34.380 --> 03:04:39.580]

pay the ducks at home at all at all yeah which really sucks uh huh well anyway i want to talk

[03:07:06.320 --> 03:07:13.460]
about i agree with you uh 1500 percent now with this uh you dance all fans p2o well you know

[03:07:13.460 --> 03:07:17.720]
they jump on how come everybody that is calling me today is all agreeing the ones that

[03:07:17.720 --> 03:07:23.820]
are because the people that agree a they don't listen to show be no that that that's not true

[03:07:23.820 --> 03:07:29.300]
okay absolutely incorrect okay they don't know anything about hockey a b if they were to call

[03:07:29.300 --> 03:07:33.540]
you show they're you know they're gonna they're gonna say oh it's a great you know they don't know

[03:07:33.540 --> 03:07:38.640]
what are they gonna say nothing they're gonna say absolutely nothing because they're in the fog

[03:07:38.640 --> 03:07:43.440]
just like the rest of the fans down here that's do with anything when it's going be

[03:07:43.440 --> 03:07:49.240]
there cheering for Whitney they you know it's just these are the same people that um you know

[03:07:49.240 --> 03:07:53.160]
i mean i mean i mean Whitney scores one of the most beautiful goals in the history of the team

[03:07:53.160 --> 03:07:58.060]
and he gets like a half a line in each column by David J. Neil and Michael Russo in the papers today

[03:07:58.060 --> 03:08:03.220]
nothing ever again it'll be a highlight goal on every hockey show all over north america for the

[03:08:03.220 --> 03:08:07.460]
rest of the season and here you get like a half a line because you got bozos writing about stuff

[03:08:07.460 --> 03:08:11.000]
they don't know what they're writing about like David J. Neil writes that all of the islanders go

[03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:15.180]
pulled them within one when they never got closer than two in a whole game there you go they

[03:08:15.180 --> 03:08:19.180]
like time they were within one was when it was none nothing one nothing nothing nothing nothing

[03:08:19.180 --> 03:08:24.520]
going back to the bracket why is it that it seems like the most imbosiled people work in broadcasting

[03:08:24.520 --> 03:08:30.280]
you excluded but like how you read that memo yesterday what other business would write a memo

[03:08:30.280 --> 03:08:35.500]
about coffee cups yeah i used to be in the business and i remember reading these notes about

[03:08:35.500 --> 03:08:42.360]
balloons and uh remotes and the stupidest things like that call please don't use the coffee cups i

[03:08:42.360 --> 03:08:48.400]
mean and this is a supposedly uh semi-core-quote major market uh-huh TV station yeah

[03:08:48.400 --> 03:08:52.640]
in Canberra, Marshall you know what though oh wait wait till i read you this piece tomorrow on this

[03:08:52.640 --> 03:08:56.980]
to channel four thing it's unbelievable you should read memos from bronca that would kill a few

[03:08:56.980 --> 03:09:03.840]
good days okay great memos from wins especially remember uh David Havley oh yeah now i don't want

[03:09:03.840 --> 03:09:06.660]
to give you have a great day pal i don't like it deep breath that's how it like peat the board

[03:09:06.660 --> 03:09:11.300]
up we have two open lines in date five six seven he's getting to him first to identify himself

[03:09:11.300 --> 03:09:16.020]
because he's so chronic now good guy but really chronic five six seven oh five six eight pound five

[03:09:16.020 --> 03:09:21.500]
six the only eighteen two wireless line it'll life beat here's Kendall hello new how's it going

[03:09:21.500 --> 03:09:25.140]
okay sir all right i'm a seasoned ticket holder for the passage i listen to your show every day

[03:09:25.140 --> 03:09:29.460]
with this is the first time i ever called all right and uh first of all i was going to tell you

[03:09:29.460 --> 03:09:33.620]
about the mighty duck game but the guy uh yeah i just got a brain shot and that kind of

[03:09:33.620 --> 03:09:36.660]
played the duck sugar last year or the year before i know you actually do play the duck

[03:09:36.660 --> 03:09:41.700]
time yeah i have season tickets up in the upper level and i have a few things that i noticed every

[03:09:41.700 --> 03:09:46.320]
game if you haven't pointed out okay first of all the scoreboard operations why is that guy fired yet

[03:09:46.800 --> 03:09:50.500]
not the guy that's operating the clock but the guy that's putting up the graphics stuff there

[03:09:50.500 --> 03:09:55.960]
yeah during the washing game when they showed the goalie match up and the starting line up you

[03:09:55.960 --> 03:09:59.740]
didn't notice it because i know you were to talk about this one for all of coldly

[03:10:00.300 --> 03:10:07.440]
they spelled his name cold jizz cold jizz right yeah instead instead of zigg maybe that's

[03:10:07.440 --> 03:10:12.340]
something else on their mind yeah and then last night uh kavasha kavasha scores a goal

[03:10:12.340 --> 03:10:17.440]
they put them up there for a penalty it's a panthers penalty only kavasha two minutes

[03:10:17.980 --> 03:10:21.360]
instead of panthers go or you do understand that most most of those people that are being

[03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:25.600]
don't know kasha from kavasha they don't know the difference you know the people up there have no clue

[03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:29.280]
what they're doing yeah you're just getting paid whatever it is for the hour the bill you know the

[03:10:29.280 --> 03:10:33.600]
the fact that the sound guy has still got a job as many weeks into the season with the horrendous job

[03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:37.840]
that he's done uh i guess if you got a job there you have a job for life for whatever reason

[03:10:37.840 --> 03:10:42.000]
and that that was another thing on it to talk about was the sound they put speakers up in the

[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:46.520]
upper level uh like little cube speakers yeah you i know you said in the lower level

[03:10:46.520 --> 03:10:50.400]
oh and by the way somebody told me i don't want to say who told me but little birdie told me

[03:10:50.400 --> 03:10:55.260]
that when they put the speaker system in there the speakers have all been installed backwards

[03:10:55.600 --> 03:10:59.820]
which is why it sounds so bad that wouldn't surprise me no i'm not making that up that's a true

[03:10:59.820 --> 03:11:03.980]
story the speakers were installed backwards well you know they put these speakers up in the upper

[03:11:03.980 --> 03:11:10.260]
level halfway through into the season yeah and some games they use them and like just like last night

[03:11:10.260 --> 03:11:14.540]
they don't use them and i know you say it's too loud in the lower bowl but in the upper bowl last

[03:11:14.540 --> 03:11:18.680]
now you couldn't hear anything really you can't hear anything why can they just turn those speakers

[03:11:18.680 --> 03:11:24.740]
on in the upper level i mean it's ridiculous they put these speakers up there they weren't up there

[03:11:24.740 --> 03:11:27.820]
at the beginning of the season yeah they put them up there now and then they don't use them

[03:11:28.380 --> 03:11:33.500]
and last night you can hear the guy mumbling well that's what we had the week before so it kind of

[03:11:33.500 --> 03:11:38.720]
balances out yeah yeah that one game i believe was a capital game right pretty loud yeah i got

[03:11:38.720 --> 03:11:43.860]
to where he was saying and then the go lights too i mean they go on when they don't score they don't

[03:11:43.860 --> 03:11:47.380]
go on when they do score oh and they don't have to worry about where i said them going on when

[03:11:47.380 --> 03:11:50.560]
they don't cause they just don't go on period where we are you couldn't see them for love or

[03:11:50.560 --> 03:11:54.400]
money and it's just it's not going to change they don't care they don't give a crap and like i

[03:11:54.400 --> 03:11:59.500]
said when you got 19,500 people in there and 19,000 of them think that a big black eye who can't

[03:11:59.500 --> 03:12:03.540]
skate is the great hockey player and the guy to get excited about how do you expect the fans to

[03:12:03.540 --> 03:12:07.500]
make a ruckus and say we want to be able to see the go lights when a goal is scored they don't care

[03:12:08.440 --> 03:12:12.040]
unbelievable and then how about the glass every game that piece comes off at the top

[03:12:12.040 --> 03:12:17.400]
yeah when you buy all the parts that you know use the auto body a joint so don't work out

[03:12:17.400 --> 03:12:22.960]
have a great way i knew your plan hey listen we're having a good time are we having a good time

[03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:27.860]
there you but we're having a kick-ass time 153 at 560 wqa m
