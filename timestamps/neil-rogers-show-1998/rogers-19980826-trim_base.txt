[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.160]
In fact, we ought to be a

[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.360]
So somebody's watching anyway

[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.580]
It said to the uh to those reasons. Oh gee. I'm munged on my beautiful shirt. Sorry not

Seriously if you had any idea how good these were you'd be foaming at the mouth with anger that you didn't get it. I didn't share

[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.900]
It says to those responsible for airing the neo-roundgers TV show pardon me while I pukes what it says

[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.060]
I realized that all I have to do to avoid this pus is change of the channel

[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.520]
But I gave it a second look because I didn't believe the s-h-e spots when I accidentally heard this effing lunatic for the first time

vomit and snot

[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.760]
In other words, it looks appetizing, but it's not

[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.740]
How on earth can you possibly make public airways available to this sick baguette and it sure as hell says a great deal for the

[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.960]

[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.640]
God

[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.940]

Joe as a matter of fact who is ordinarily over there on the board during the show Joe has left

[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:21.680]
And right now we just have like an empty stool. Okay. There's just a big stool over there where Joe used to be

[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.640]
Well, what are you laughing about? He's got to listen to Warrant from Marty and Sammy Sosa

[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.440]
Because this is your goddamn jockstrap station. It's your sports intensive station man

[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.960]
And Warrant for Marty he be probably one of the most articulate x-jocks that I've ever heard my goddamn life not

[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:42.040]
He belongs on the era like my little dog belongs on a year making the guttural

[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.400]
Winning sound

[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.920]
He belongs on ear like like that music belongs on a year Warrant for Marty

[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.460]
So it's been nice knowing you. We'll do the best we can. I'll just sit here and eat

[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.640]
Where we going here's Miami. Hello

[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.460]

[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:30.460]
No, I don't don't get don't get your hopes up. Okay, there's nothing this place here is so goddamn small

[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:38.480]
What I was just had visions of five things firing at the same time like you did nothing is gonna fire okay the only thing I might get fired is

[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:40.400]
Yeah

[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.480]
Yeah, I got a bunch of crap here like these village people. Why does she keep sending me village people?

[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:51.240]
Is she think they're a bunch of fags listening to this show? Is that what it is what the hell's wrong with her? Was that what it is?

[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:52.680]
Like I said

[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:59.080]
Come on, come on. Oh, there you go. Well the one button that I needed to be down there it popped up

[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.860]
We got the Geno Vannelli

[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.800]
Who's related to millie

[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.160]
Millie Vannelli. Oh, that's this real screamer. I just took it. Oh, you don't want that believe me

[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:14.520]
You don't want to be calling that in your collection. I guarantee they'll come with a fly swatter and a butterfly net and take your ass away

[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.700]
I took all the good stuff out of here, which I good stuff would be an example look at all the buttons

[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.180]
You know

[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:30.520]
We don't have any room here for Christ makes it's like doing a goddamn show in a broom closet. What do you want from me?

[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:36.120]
When there's little tiny broom closet. Oh, yeah, we saw it on TV. It looks like a nice beautiful studio to watch

[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.300]
Yeah, good good luck to you. Hope you have good success with your show in here

[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.980]
Look at that. They're all gone to waxy right now. We got two calls left on the board

[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.180]
567 05 60 pound 560 on the 18 T line

[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:55.160]
That goes to show the loyal audience that we got I come on here. I take a chance made a bad calculated error there

[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.620]
Announcing that warrants from Marty's interviewing the great sami soso of the Chicago Cubs on waxy

[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:06.400]
790 and my loyal audience that we can't find with a goddamn search party is watching that whammy show at night

[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:11.300]
My big fat loyal audience. They're gone in a heartbeat all the good CDs are gone, which they weren't that good in the first place

[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.340]
We're having a pretty good day today not too bad

[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.080]
Under the circumstances a great lunch from hops

[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:23.660]
But as soon as they discovered that there's someone else for them to float they just float away just like a bunch of

[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.240]
hummingbirds and heat

[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.900]

we know there's no live racing all this week because they're resurfacing the

[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.280]

[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.000]
is it just on the third floor would have like a very limited simlecasting thing

[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.220]
or is it uh... we were acquiring mines what i don't know what's going on up

[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.860]
there and nobody will tell us

[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.880]
for years i've been fighting the good fight trying to do something for my good

[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.260]
sponsors who pay their good hard earned money and thanks to people like my

[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.540]

everybody in their brother i don't want to have people show up there and

[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.980]
i'm expecting they can go on a fourth floor and sit in their box around the

[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.380]
floor of webtoon hill are going to be sitting

[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.420]
and that there will be windows open even if it's only for the simlecasting and

[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.760]
then fight out the fourth floor is closed tonight and if there's no meal in

[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.820]

no chance here's kendall hello yeah it's going to okay sir you listen i was done with the

[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:53.920]
post office the other day just moved into a new neighborhood right yeah so i go in there and i

[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:59.040]
asked the guy i said hey you know when is it that you're gonna go ahead start you know sending the

[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:03.680]
mail to the neighborhood when when do i stop calling it over here to pick it up so he tells me

[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:09.020]
oh there's two criteria so i go what's what's one of them because well first of all they have to

[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:14.560]
have fifty percent or more than done before we come deliver the mail that's all right and i

[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:19.900]
said what's the second criteria so he tells me he goes well what happens is that we have a surveyor

[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:26.060]
a guy that goes out every month and there can't be any road or any construction in your neighborhood

[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:30.680]
going on that impede the guy from delivering the mail of course you don't want to get in my journey

[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.600]
and all messed up you don't want to be driving through slopp and all of that so i tell him i

[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.820]
go i don't understand how can you say that you're going to deliver at a fifty percent when there

[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:44.160]
can't be no construction going on so he goes well it depends some neighborhoods go ahead and they

[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:49.000]
start building from front to back and i go what now kind of neighborhood is that that builds from

[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.940]
front to back a build whenever whoever buys a lot you know so i say well basically you're telling me

[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:57.180]
that i'm not going to get the mail until the whole complete neighborhood is done every trucking

[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:02.400]
god's creation is gone you as well i'm not saying that what i'm saying is that you know i said okay

[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:09.680]

[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.880]

Amsterdam or to wherever you're going they fly a non stop from here to Brussels right right then

[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.740]
