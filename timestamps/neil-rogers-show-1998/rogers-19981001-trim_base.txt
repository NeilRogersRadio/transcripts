[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540]
The science following.

[00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.540]
What I call a dirty square dance.

[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.860]
Up with the pit go down with the fence, in with the pickery, everybody dance.

[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.760]
Girls win rags on up against the walls, guys with a heart on promenade dolls.

[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.420]
Girls grab your partners, permanently by the balls, drag them down the length of the halls.

[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.660]
All right.

[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.080]
Make up my hollars, make them shout, what you pretty has up against is now.

[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.920]
First lady goes, taking lady pass, third lady finger up the porch, guys I have.

[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.000]
Finger out, crawling into halls, now release the more guys balls.

[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.600]
Down with the petticoat, up with the fence, dancing to end of the dirty square dance.

[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.700]
Tosito are ricking, I'm tired now, I think I'm gonna go grab me some french fried potatoes.

[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:42.680]

[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:41.400]
So we may have to actually come on here and start begging for cigars, begging for stogies and of course if we get some good ones we'll have to talk about them unfortunately. Hate to break the news to you. So anyway our center one thing officially kicks off this weekend and this I could do the rest of the show here today without even breaking for commercials about this. We'll be at the borders in Galar over by Galaria in for Lauderdale this Saturday October 3rd from noon to 2 and then I find out through the grapefine.

[00:03:44.920 --> 00:04:11.000]
I find out through the grapefine that we're gonna be at pizza loft this next Tuesday night October 6th from 6 to 8 p.m. I had suggested to screw in when she came down here a couple of days ago. After she gave me this list of dates which I'm not gonna be here half of these dates and we had to try to get this straightened out. I had suggested since she had pizza lofts to get you for the day on my birthday when I'm not gonna be here. That maybe we could move that to Tuesday and let me know you know like revise the list and let me see what's really going on here.

[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:20.880]
Well come to find out that our exotic promotions guy over there Sam the sham who must have lots of naked pictures of lots of people in this company to keep that job.

[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:30.600]
Come to find out they put a press release out yesterday announcing that this coming Tuesday night October 6th will be at the pizza loft from 6 to 8 p.m. with our center one best and

[00:04:30.660 --> 00:05:00.640]
real stuff. Did they send us a copy of the press release. Did anybody tell us about it. Did we discuss it and find with me. Are we gonna be there. Yeah, we'll be there. But would it be nice for us to know about these things. I know you're starting to get picky again. Your secondary. That's right. We're small potatoes because it's Sam and Luan. They're the ones that are in charge of this. They're the ones that are gonna make this thing fly. What tell do we know about raising money for charity anyway. And also that phone number for center one. That's what I'm gonna be doing. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this

[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:30.540]
special phone line or to the best of me. Let me let me let me straight it out for you. There are two volumes this year. Volume one is great stuff. And volume two is like kind of like the old Neil unplugged stuff. That's like a little X rated with no bleeps in it or anything like that. With all the words that you want to hear. So there are two great volumes to make up for last year when we didn't have one. And that's center one number which will be working. Bell South assures us sometime today tomorrow. So she just called. Like I said, Bell South assures us the delay in getting the line

[00:05:30.540 --> 00:06:00.380]
working is because of the hurricane. Everything is because of the hurricane. That's a good excuse for everybody that can't get the rack together. 954. 563. 3600. That's gonna be the number. It will be working tomorrow to order your best of Neil for 97 and 98. Volume is one and two cassettes. CDs. Whatever you like. 20 bucks a pop which all goes to center one. 954. 563. 3600. But at any rate, as far as this is center one promotion is concerned, it's interesting. And I've been telling you all along and very honestly, I have no reason to make this up.

[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:30.320]
That Sam, the sham and the nephew, the so called promotion department here, the incestuous relationship, the people that have the naked pictures of people that work here. And do absolutely nothing have been totally, absolutely 100% beyond the shadow of a doubt uninvolved in his promotion. Which is why we couldn't do it last year, even though I wasn't on the air here yet. Nonetheless, starting October one, I was on the payroll, right? Yeah, there you go. Nice job if you can get it. And we were hoping to do it last year to raise all that money for center one.

[00:06:30.320 --> 00:07:00.300]
But Gregory didn't want to put up the front money. So I put it up this year made by $10,000 donation early just so we have the front money to print the CDs and cassettes because this is such a cheap ass outfit. And yet they want to, you know, they run in these promos on you're like somehow this is a Q and promotion. They want to take credit like, Oh, look what we're doing in our promotion department is really involved in this. Aren't they? No. It's embarrassing like everything else that goes on here. It's embarrassing. So I'm starting to make up a short list. Maybe you want to think about this today. Of people who are in the office, I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office

[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:30.280]
I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office.

[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.960]
Oh, we can't do remotes on this day and we can't do remotes on Sundays because we got

[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.140]
to often games as if he needs to be there.

[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.720]
As if somehow he's like irreplaceable and needs to be there for us to pull these things

[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.000]
off.

[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.880]
Was he there with any of our other appearances for a center one?

[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:45.100]
No.

[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.880]
For Camilo South.

[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.140]
No.

[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.800]
Ready the other money we ever raised in the past.

[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.060]
No.

[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.900]
Did we somehow get through and make it then raise a lot of money without Sam the sham?

[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.520]
The QA.

[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.160]
Okay.

[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.760]
1014 at 560 QM.

[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.140]
Now you tell me some asshole at the fan in Denver has called us and given you a bunch

[00:07:59.140 --> 00:07:59.520]
of crap.

[00:07:59.520 --> 00:07:59.560]
Yeah.

[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.600]
WQIM.

[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:01.980]
Too bad.

[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.080]
Maybe I'll call back.

[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:04.680]
Maybe.

[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.800]
Because Jim Leeland's having a press conference today and what time do we know what time

[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.720]
the press conference is?

[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:10.340]
Joe.

[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.320]
We already know that he's leaving and that he's going to go to a managed Colorado.

[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.340]
We already know that.

[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.780]
Anybody with a brain knows that.

[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.440]
What time is it?

[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.020]
1045.

[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.700]
1045 and we'll put it on for a few minutes.

[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.360]
Get the emis to real world there from Jim Leeland.

[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.600]
There's a good guy but not stupid enough to stick around here.

[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.440]
How come that guy didn't call back from the fan in Denver?

[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.920]
What was he giving you a bunch of crap about?

[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.660]
I don't understand.

[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.240]
What is there to bitch you out about?

[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.920]
Because we're not going to sit and have a long chat with him about it.

[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.120]
We're not doing a sports show here between 10 and 2.

[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:42.920]
Is that okay?

[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.600]
Is that all right?

[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.400]
Jesus Christ almighty.

[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.440]
He sports nerds who think that there's nothing else going on in the world besides

[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.620]
somebody running around with a jock strap on.

[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.580]
We're in a middle of a worldwide depression baby.

[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.860]
Not just recession one, the verge of a worldwide depression and people are worried about his

[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.300]
Jim Leeland going to be managing the marlins again next year.

[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.260]
No way Jose.

[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.740]
We can't even get a straight answer.

[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.320]
Is John Henry really by the team?

[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.740]
Are we ever going to get an answer on this?

[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.660]
Is there going to build them in a arena, a stadium of this?

[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.200]
Are they going to build them a pup tent?

[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.920]
Where's the money going to come from?

[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.460]
Fred Graham by the way, good article in the paper today baby.

[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:17.760]
Nice going.

[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.140]
Right on target.

[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.480]
As we continue searching for more money to build stadiums and arenas for millionaires

[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.120]
and billionaires.

[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:24.800]
Nice going.

[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.380]
But some jackass over there in Denver is very upset over the fact that we're not all

[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.880]
worked up into a friends here because Jim Leeland is making an announcement today.

[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.960]
Here's a call from Houston.

[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:36.300]
Hello.

[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:37.840]
Neil.

[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.380]
Yes sir.

[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.960]
Hey, I just want to tell you that the internet saved my life because I moved to Atlanta

[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.100]
about a year ago and I still managed to listen to you at least once a week or so.

[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.480]
Right.

[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.560]
And I'm in Houston.

[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.280]
Would you move there?

[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.100]
No, I'm just working here and I got in the hotel I'm flipping around for the ballgame

[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.960]
and I passed Larry King Live with Rob's Piro.

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.360]
Oh, is that incredible or what?

[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.640]
I was laughing my ass off.

[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.000]
And here's what he had to say.

[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.360]
I saw a clip on the news this morning where he's talking about Clinton ought to resign

[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.520]
and they ought to take up a petition drive to force him to quit.

[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.520]
They have a candlelight vigil and caravans of trucks carrying these petitions from all

[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.280]
corners of the universe.

[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.260]
Oh my god.

[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.340]
Larry with that little sanctimonious rolling up his sleeve dude do all over the place.

[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.140]
I know how to do a torture.

[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:20.600]
Yeah, right.

[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.060]
Unbelievable.

[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.680]
It was funny.

[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.580]
And you know something.

[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.420]
And the interesting part of it is and I'm sure Larry didn't mention the fact that all

[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.500]
a Ross Piro supporters have abandoned him and discussed when they found out what a pony

[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.320]
he was and a total BS artist.

[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.600]
And half the fault calls he were taken were set up calls like, Rob, you're great.

[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.760]
We're going to run for president.

[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.200]
Right.

[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:42.540]
Right.

[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:42.960]
Right.

[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.640]
Leave it to Larry, baby.

[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.020]
He knows how to suck like nobody even Monica could take lessons.

[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.100]
I've been doing this along.

[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:49.940]
Yeah, we know Larry.

[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:50.740]
It was great.

[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.060]
Okay, have a great day, pal.

[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:52.620]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.260]
And a great life.

[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.320]
Hey, Larry King pumping up a little Ross Piro again.

[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.220]
Gotta roll up your sleeves and do do do.

[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.980]
Biggest bullcrap artist that ever came down to play snake royal salesman.

[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.120]
Little bigoted means spirit and nasty prick.

[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:06.220]
Fony baloney.

[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.040]
Oh, yeah, they're going to they're going to set up a hoodie or mess up my daughter's wedding

[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.560]
because they're trying to make us look bad.

[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.500]
Oh, yeah, they're sabotaging his daughter's wedding.

[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.100]
Paranoids, I got a clinic, egotistical prick.

[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.000]
And people went out and voted for him for president.

[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:20.740]
How do you like that?

[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.840]
Of course, he had screwed around because it would touch him.

[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.340]
Speaking of people touching each other, somebody finally said this to me, this cliping from

[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.540]
I guess I was on vacation when this came into paper.

[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.120]
Bishop of state battle heats up is what it says.

[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.200]
We're talking about the late and bishop.

[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.580]
Anybody remember the late and bishop?

[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:40.100]
No.

[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.200]
Of course you do.

[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:42.620]
How's Andrew?

[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.440]
Have a nice day.

[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:43.680]
Right.

[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.500]
The fight over the estate of Channel 10 anchor and bishop is getting down right ugly it says.

[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:54.200]
Helen Buckner, longtime companion of the famously dignified bishop, is being sued for a million

[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.800]
dollars in damages by radio personality Sandy Payton, who ironically received the bulk

[00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.840]
of bishop's estate.

[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.560]
How do you like that?

[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.640]
I would love to keep you all to myself.

[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.680]
That must be what she told her just before she croak.

[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.540]
The waxy talk, myster was posed with bishop, especially toward the end.

[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.060]
It doesn't say which end.

[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:17.100]
When she helped care for bishop who was battling cancer, bishop charged, uh, changed her.

[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:17.980]
Let me say it again.

[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.900]
Bishop changed her will seven months before she died, giving Payton 75% of her 1.1 million

[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.740]
dollar IRA.

[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.300]
Oy!

[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.080]
Buckner, who originally was supposed to get the largest piece of the pie, but broke up

[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.640]
with bishop in 1991, was given bishop's candle home and the rest of the IRA.

[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.700]
Last month, Buckner filed a court notice implying manipulation of the will.

[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.020]
I've been slandered and defamed Payton told insider it's got to stop.

[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:48.020]
In a July letter to Payton, Buckner unsuccessfully offered a settle the dispute of Payton Pater,

[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.480]
another 142,000 from the IRA.

[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:55.600]
The incentive for Payton to settle changed the will because of a lesbian relationship with

[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.660]
the divorced Payton.

[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.420]
How do you like that?

[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.380]
It's not because you're associated with a gay person that your gay weener said,

[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.940]
Sandy has an impeccable reputation and it's been trampled.

[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.020]
Said Buckner, lawyer Lee Schollinger, I'm surprised they want to air this out.

[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.140]
When it got there and it out.

[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.940]
I would love to keep you all to myself.

[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:13.900]
Nice going, Sandy.

[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:20.500]
And it's really interesting that now that she's dead, only after you're dead are you supposed

[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.200]
to say this.

[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.240]
Now they're saying that where's that term again?

[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.660]
Not because you're associated with a gay person that your gay.

[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.760]
So they're actually coming out now and saying that Anne Bishop was a guy.

[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.840]
Not that we didn't know that.

[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.000]
Not that it's a great revelation.

[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.060]
But now that she's dead, it's okay to say it.

[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.520]
Is it okay?

[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:38.900]
Okay.

[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:39.660]
There you go.

[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:40.980]
Yeah.

[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.120]
You better tell Rob Kaplan that okay.

[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.520]
It's not because you're associated with a gay person that it necessarily makes you gay.

[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.400]
Necessarily, all he's worried about.

[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.200]
Better to draw him a diagram.

[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.520]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:53.920]
Hello.

[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.020]
Neil.

[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:55.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.520]
What's going on?

[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:56.980]
Not much.

[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.340]
That guy kind of stole my thunder about Rob Ferrell.

[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.260]
I'm switched around and I'm watching a little soccer, I'm watching a little baseball.

[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:02.900]
That's a mad.

[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.640]
And then I see Rob's on there.

[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:11.240]
And I couldn't help but get past that he kept calling her a vulnerable young woman.

[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:11.820]
Oh, yeah.

[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.340]
Votable.

[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.520]
I mean, with her other knee pads, presidential knee pads.

[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.120]
Actually, you're very good at getting a little bit of a ball.

[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.240]
A little bit of ball there.

[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.440]
And today, you know, it could be that she was actually the one that instigated this.

[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.320]
Yeah, wow.

[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.360]
She already says that it's not just in the star magazine.

[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.000]
It's in the, uh, Kenneth star report.

[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:31.660]
It's in there.

[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.720]
She admits she, she brags over the fact that she went there and instigated and floated

[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.440]
with him and to show him her ass and yada yada and all the other stuff.

[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.880]
She admits that proudly.

[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.960]
Well, he's got to have some kind of morality.

[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.720]
He's saying in this and that and that.

[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.420]
I think Larry made some kind of association with it.

[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.880]
If you were the, if you hit, you're, uh, you had a, your CEO, follow about us and that

[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.480]
and got busted.

[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.000]
Well, if he was doing lanterns, he'd be out of the right away, even though Larry said,

[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.220]
what if he tripled profits and everything's running great?

[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.820]
And they're going to, oh, I fired him.

[00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.160]
No doubt.

[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.260]
No question right away.

[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:00.660]
Yeah.

[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.200]
And Larry's asking him, what's you?

[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.360]
What if you were the CEO?

[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.640]
Oh, Larry, how could you ask me something like that?

[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.040]
He's crazy.

[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.520]
He is crazy.

[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.260]
He's crazy.

[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.660]
Well, however, uh, crazy like a fox, but Larry keeps putting him on her again.

[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.780]
I mean, who in America?

[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.640]
Who in the right mind wants to hear that little puddle whack or anymore?

[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:16.460]
Not I, sir.

[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.660]
In addition to which I wouldn't be surprised if he takes it up the leggoes, what I heard.

[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:20.740]
All right, Dale.

[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.480]
Have a great day.

[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:21.960]
Thank you, D.

[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.920]
OK, 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 18 T wireless.

[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.400]
I'm going to get any response here today.

[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:27.680]
No.

[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.840]
I'm going to wake up the natives today.

[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.080]
No.

[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.460]
Got the big hockey game tonight at the new Macarena.

[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.960]
That'll be my first event.

[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.080]
I've been in there three times, but this will be my first time actually seeing a game.

[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.020]
And the thing that really distresses me, my luck, my luck.

[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.540]
I'm reading about the game tonight.

[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.100]
And it says the rank at National Car rental center will become a virtual test tube when

[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.140]
the panthers play the Carolina Huracun's tonight.

[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.980]
In what is an NHL experiment that few members of the league seem to care for, the center

[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.460]
red line won't be in use.

[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.600]
I'll call a chalky.

[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.840]
I mean, give me a break.

[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.220]
The one game experiment will be examined to determine if it leads to greater scoring.

[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.600]
Panther coach Terry Murray hates the idea.

[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.460]
And I's gone, Terry.

[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:06.900]
I went on target, sweetheart.

[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.540]
I don't agree with it.

[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.140]
But Murray said there are too many bad habits taking out the red line as stupid trial.

[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.380]
It will change evaluations on our defenseman.

[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.920]
You couldn't fall to play if he gets caught on a breakaway tonight.

[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.520]
Absolutely correct, sir.

[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.980]
Who now wants to go to a hockey game where they got no center red line and where they

[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.760]
like changing the rules and making it up as they go along?

[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.100]
Well, it's only a nice evasion game.

[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.600]
What they're bad enough to begin with.

[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.860]
So I think like maybe one period tonight and checking out the entire arena and the food

[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.180]
stands and stuff like that, that'll be good enough for us.

[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.300]
5'6'7", 05'60", 05'60", on the 18t wireless line.

[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.780]
Let's go to...

[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.460]
Even a guy from the fan in Denver didn't call back.

[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.260]
So let's see.

[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.900]
Between Allen and when we get the...

[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:51.940]
They got nothing these people.

[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.220]
We got a new CD from Tracy Nealy.

[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:54.840]
We got what?

[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.460]
A new CD from Tracy Nealy.

[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:57.640]
What do you mean?

[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.280]
A new CD.

[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:00.980]
Being one.

[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.200]
What is it?

[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.220]
Pure disc or three?

[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:14.840]
Yeah.

[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.080]
Meaning what?

[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:17.820]
Just one of them?

[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.360]
Yeah, just one.

[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.260]
And I got more coming.

[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.280]
And then as after that wasn't bad enough and we opened up the paper this morning on the

[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.300]
front page, which was it?

[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:36.920]
They're here, I guess.

[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.600]
Now, their turncoat, Willie Logan, sparts for Jeb Bush.

[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.280]
There you go.

[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.400]
He's all bent out of shape because he was too liberal for the Democrats up in Tallahassee

[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.220]
and so they pushed him up.

[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.040]
You know, too liberal.

[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.360]
So he's going to endorse Jeb Bush.

[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.400]
That makes a lot of sense.

[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.820]
Willie Logan, baby, he's the highest profile black Democrat to endorse Jeb Bush.

[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.020]
We got Jews for Bush.

[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.080]
Schwarz is for Bush.

[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.720]
And he, you know, they might as well call off the election because that Bubba there,

[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.200]
Buddy McKay, got two chances none and much, much less than none.

[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.120]
See, we don't have people anymore that stand on any kind of principle that stand for

[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:09.400]
anything.

[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.980]
It's all strictly a personal thing.

[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:12.920]
You know, you pith me off.

[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.800]
So therefore, I'm going to be a turncoat now.

[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.220]
I'm going to, you know, even though it's totally flies in the face of everything that

[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.880]
makes any sense for me, I'm going to support a right wing lunatic called Jeb Bush.

[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:23.380]
Nice going there, Willie.

[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.160]
You jackass.

[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.800]
Now, what are these?

[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:27.740]
What is this?

[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:28.620]
What are we doing?

[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.220]
Are we doing something new and different here today?

[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.980]
Are we doing what?

[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.480]
Something new and different that they all say anonymous.

[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.900]
Is that what that is all about?

[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.760]
Here's anonymous on five.

[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.060]
Hello.

[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.000]
Hello.

[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.300]
What are we doing with these people?

[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.600]
What are you doing in there?

[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.720]
I just put them on hold.

[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:49.200]
Yeah.

[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.480]
And here's Tallahassee.

[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:51.720]
Hello.

[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.460]
Hey, Neil.

[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.100]
Yes, sir?

[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.480]
I listened to only one of Georgia's shows all the way through the religion show.

[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:56.920]
Yeah.

[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.100]
And despite the fact that I actually went to synagogue yesterday, I liked the great deal.

[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:01.820]
Yeah.

[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:02.840]
I'm glad you're back, though.

[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.260]
Please, no more Michael Jackson.

[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.820]
You can only take so much of that.

[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:06.240]
Yeah.

[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.340]
So actually, not Michael Jackson, but the Jackson Five.

[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.680]
I agree with you about politics in Florida.

[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.420]
I didn't tell Hathy or living in Tallahassee right now visiting down south.

[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.340]
And as soon as you get pushed, get elected, I want to get the hell out of that town before

[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.460]
turns into, you know, before they start putting up the camp.

[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:23.660]
OK.

[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.460]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.480]
OK, five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.160]
As the Neil Rogers show comes to a brutal screeching halt.

[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.900]
This is the end this week, by the way.

[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.320]
It's very fitting that yesterday was young Kipper.

[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.680]
Young Kipper is over by the way.

[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.640]
Now the coast is clear.

[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.320]
Oh, too late.

[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.080]
Don't make any difference.

[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.060]
Does anybody care?

[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:42.340]
No.

[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:46.720]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.500]
While the other Toyota dealers advertised the QA.

[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.940]
The work you're creating over here in my life is the reality.

[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.760]
Down, down, down, down, down.

[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.520]
Mark is going down, down, down, down, down.

[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.860]
Mark is going down, down, down, down, down.

[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.100]
Dark market is down.

[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.460]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.120]
Well, my brookers calling.

[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.860]
And he's telling me the market's fallen.

[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.660]
Now he's standing by his window.

[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.820]
Falling.

[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.160]
Coming, jump with me.

[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.280]
My socks, socks, socks, are fading.

[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.920]
They even know, even know I'm just a heavy trading.

[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.640]
To hit the pavement, I'm in the sub-hating.

[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.400]
Coming, jump with me.

[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.160]
Mark is precious.

[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.280]
Our life is precious before my very eyes.

[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.360]
Stocks on jumping, then on jumping.

[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.140]
Oh, bear the coffin, just outside.

[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.980]
Now I'm standing, 50 floors above where I'll be landed.

[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.760]
Oh, why family, I will be stranded.

[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.560]
Coming, jump with me.

[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.640]
Oh, oh, oh, the economy.

[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.540]
Oh, my God, this is killin' me.

[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.600]
I've got about 70 down points already.

[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.740]
And probably going to go for another 2,300 today

[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:16.600]
before the day is out.

[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.520]
Japan's going to be open-night in Europe.

[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.920]
I mean, Europe is really big time today.

[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.520]
All over Europe, Germany, London, Paris, Zurich.

[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.920]
And a couple of months ago they were all telling us,

[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.320]
oh, baby, don't worry, we've already

[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.940]
factored in the age of factor and the Russian factor and don't worry about that

[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.740]
in ebby joseph koana kareem Abdul Schwartz was telling us hey don't worry about it

[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.780]

Yeah, I was shocked. I thought he'd be coming back. Yeah, sure he did. I thought on the outside chance to get a little slow. Yeah

[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.520]
He's coming back in a black body condom looking like Dan Radler in the storm. Go ahead Donnie

[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:47.280]
Wishful thinking but he's grateful to the organization and the fans. He said they go to Colorado

[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:53.000]
No, no, he said he hasn't talked to anybody. He will not talk to you. That's a lie. No, he says he hasn't talked to anybody

[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.500]
He's gonna take his time. No Jim Leland hasn't talked to anybody

[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.980]
He is a man of his word if nothing else now. I'm pretty good. Oh you are such a suck. Oh no, he really is

[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:05.060]
What are you auditioning to replace Guilty now? Is that it? Oh come on

[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:11.500]
Come on nail go ahead Donnie. He's appreciates everything that that Wayne and Don smiley did for me

[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:16.360]
He was very impressed with John Henry and with John Henry and wishes everybody the best but at this point

[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.000]
He's gonna just he said it was a major decision for him to him

[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.940]
This was shocking the world that he wasn't come back because to him you know to him

[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:28.240]
It's a shock that he's not coming back. I mean he he feels it made here comes as a great shock to me

[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.720]
Made a song. Yeah, but he has no plans at this time. He said he hasn't talked to anybody

[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.900]
But he will he will talk to people and see what happens

[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.060]
Yeah, but at this point, you know, he's gonna sit by the phone. He doesn't have to manage this year

[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:47.060]
But he will it will it for the right situation like Neil Rogers is gonna sit by the phone weight for the phone to ring

[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:52.620]
Exactly, right, you know you got all the point in over the phone like Glenn Campbell right right and

[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:58.080]
You know, he's a rhinestone cowboys gonna sit there and wait for the offers to pour in doesn't matter if it's a L or N

[00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.560]
Cosure cowboys

[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:07.220]
So basically that's it the biggest decision to Marlon history right now Jim Leeland leaving the organization. Oh

[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:11.460]
God, all by the way you put that is so dramatic. I'm just almost spent at this point

[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:14.060]
You know the the most momentous okay

[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.340]
I thought that maybe like the sailor the team would be a little more momentous. Wouldn't you think so?

[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.880]
Well, the sailor the team without Jim Leeland

[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.100]
I think this is bigger Jim Leeland

[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.700]
Because he's not gonna be here. He's in other words

[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:30.320]
If John Henry comes along and we build a new stadium and they actually spend some money and get a couple of pictures on there

[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:34.140]
That that's not more important than having Jim Leeland is that what you're saying? I don't want to argue with you

[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:37.920]
Don't know I just want to make you understand what you're saying, but that's the expert you're the bad hasn't happened

[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:43.020]
You demand that hasn't happened yet. Yeah, right? I mean, so that this point is the biggest decision

[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.300]
That's that's right up to this moment. This is the most

[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.800]
You know, would you say this is more important than them winning the world series

[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:54.340]
This is the biggest decision. That's not a decision. That's an actual occurrence. Okay, the biggest decision

[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:58.960]
Yes, yeah, and the biggest announcement we didn't have to announce that they were winning the world

[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.560]
Now is that I think the world and then Greg Reed not pushing in the five or fifteen million dollars to help by the team

[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:09.580]
Is it a bigger decision than that? Well, that was yeah, that was a momentous occasion. Yeah, that was true. That was pretty shocking to all of us

[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:14.600]
The fact that Greg didn't write his own personal check this matter fact. I think we work here. I'm pretty shocked by that

[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.480]
Well, because he is pretty giving isn't he was he's pretty free with the money

[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.040]
That's it. He says doesn't matter

[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:23.520]
Really national league or American league for all those who say he doesn't want to manage in the American league

[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.600]
It just really depends on the job and if the right one comes along

[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.020]
They'll take it if not he'll wait you know a couple years or next year until

[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.280]
And he's out and he's out he doesn't

[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.800]
He really impressed with John Henry

[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.440]
But he didn't really want to wait for the time to want to wait for the time table to rebuild again. Right

[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.640]
Okay, thanks Donnie. No problem. Great job. Hey, thank you now

[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:51.600]
Okay, 1057 at 560 W Kismence the reaction and Jim Lee Lens leaving are you shocked? Oh, yeah, are you is this momentous? Uh-huh

[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:56.680]
Woo. I don't know if I'm going to be able to continue throughout the day. We're just starting to build just a little tiny bit of momentum there

[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:03.800]
Poio trap accounts got a lot of money. So you can take the state concealed weapon permit course for only $30 on

Is Jim Leland announcing he's not coming back to the Marlin? Oh, they don't give a crap about their fans

[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.080]
They're like big government as long as they keep paying the money. They don't really

[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.820]
Care what the fans they don't give a flying crap is that what you're saying sir?

[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:37.400]
Money and that's out why we're all on a recession right now because the big business is just taking too much of cram in their pocket

[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:15.780]
He's the only one who uh, he's full of crap. He's a little torp who has nothing to say about anything. He's an idiot

[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.780]
What do you know? And all those people who supported him and worked for him found out what a phony he was

[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.340]
And that's why all his organization

[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:26.380]
Disbanded and they all left and walked away and discussed when they found out what a little egotistical phony twerp

[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:32.840]
He was I worked for him. Yeah, and I'm feeling the reform party. Well, you must be the one left. You must be the reform party

[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.460]
At least he gave us a party to be able to

[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:42.020]
He didn't give you crap. Okay. All he did was give you his ego and sit there and pontificate and talk about your glittering

[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:47.260]
Generality about ruling up your sleeves and dusting off the old studies. He didn't know his ass from your elbow

Okay, he's the only one who would give us true numbers. He would see the only one who wouldn't who when numbers about what

[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:40.300]
Well, sir. I can't stand this old ass town. You don't understand this you've never been a Charlotte County apparently

[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:44.060]
I've been through it real fast. Oh god Neil. Oh, you don't blink

[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.020]
Don't blink if you come to this town because that you oh

[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:50.840]
Well, I'll tell you since we got back on a year and four Myers-Man and responses been

[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:54.820]
Under what I think that's the problem. I think putting us back in four Myers is what killed us

[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:57.560]
Well, you know what do you believe or not? I can pick you up in my car radio

[00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:00.280]
But I listen to you more times than not. I listen to you on the internet

[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.160]
I am a circus circle side of the mannequin

[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.540]
um, yeah

[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.600]
And I just want to I do have a question though about this Saturday

[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:14.060]
Which board is bookstore and fundraiser bulls-rider you're gonna be at that's okay? Okay, noon to two

[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:20.460]
Noon to two okay. I just lie to okay. I just lie to okay. I just lie to okay. I just want to make sure fact

[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:24.020]
I wouldn't be surprised at all audience shows up. I wouldn't be probably 40 50 people

[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:29.080]
Well, listen you got my votes there and okay. I want to reiterate with those colors that before

[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:33.540]
I mean I was flipping channel last night myself and Ross Perot is an apple. I mean

[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:37.240]
I'm tired of Larry King bringing him on but he that little ninja makes it makes the ass

[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:40.800]
You know, if Larry King would stop putting him on he would just go away and do everybody a favor

[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:45.080]
But you know Larry. He must be alone on 50 dollars as long as 50 dollars. No way

[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:48.420]
Maybe he's gonna have Larry's baby next. Okay, pal have a great day. I'm gonna do you say bye

[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:52.260]
Okay, we have all the day lines wide open here five six seven oh five sixty

[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:55.760]
Ponet see that thing about the cue me, you know, I said here and thinking about that

[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.640]
There's certain play it there's certain play it there's certain play it

[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:02.360]
There's certain places where they're like an unlimited basically number of potential listeners

[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:06.860]
But when you look at the demographics of this market, you know, you got to realize that I've been here long enough

[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:09.980]
I've saturated this market in other words everybody who might ever listen to this show

[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:13.220]
They already either are listening or not is the case maybe and that's it

[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:21.260]
Because when you when you start eliminating you know just by process of elimination the enormous chunks of people who are never going to listen to this station

[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:28.120]
Or this radio show or any English language show. I mean, there's no chance those people are gone and they're always going to be gone

[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:33.000]
As opposed to being like an living and breathing place. We're almost everybody speaking in glaze

[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:40.540]
And there's a possibility that someday somehow you might actually expand your horizons and start talking to new and different breathing people

[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:49.280]
So here's a mobile and West Palm Beach. Hello, you know, this town has nothing to offer a bunch of roofs out there. Yeah

[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:57.460]
You might as well get the doggy book out and see who's breed a dog is smarter. You know, we get more response with that. I'll guarantee you that I went

[00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:58.780]

[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:05.760]
Open line and Broward and all two-ed-aid five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on a mobile one line

[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:09.980]
Yeah, you're real funny. I'll tell you. I'll write about you in my memoirs

[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:12.340]
Here's a mobile in bokeh. Hello

[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:18.320]
Mobile in bokeh. Hey now. Yes, sir. Yeah, when it comes to Clinton

[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.660]
Have you been wearing your presidential knee pads?

[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:22.120]
Phil

[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:27.800]
When it comes to Clinton. What does that have to do? What is with what I'm doing? Have to do with Clinton, sir

[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:29.960]
Well, like you know like throughout your ass

[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:35.820]
Open line and Broward five six seven. See, let me say it again. They're all listening

[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:40.640]
They're all listening including this guy every single day of his life up there in bokeh

[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:45.060]
Or wherever in hell he is because he can't really get a job in a real place. So he's in bokeh

[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.000]
He's on the periphery of like a real market

[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:49.280]
sweet water

[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:58.340]
But he's up there listening air be god damn day, but he's got nothing to say so air be called in the show is another homophobic shot

[00:53:58.340 --> 00:53:58.860]
God

[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:05.440]
God for this bag and honor radio because where else with assholes like him have an outlet for his

[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:07.540]
Whatever it is his sputum

[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:08.360]
right

[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.780]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:17.440]
Neil yes, sir God how you doing? I'm doing okay. Ah this time man is sicker than ever

[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:23.940]
It must have taken sick pills that we got was gone. Hey, you realize the other ones and in the yellow pages you don't have a

[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.420]
number in the yellow pages

[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.180]
The only one who doesn't have a number

[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:32.920]
Study QA of course because that might cost extra you don't expect them to do that to you

[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:33.640]
Yeah

[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:42.640]
All the economic indicators we've got low unemployment low inflation we have about a beat but a boob at a

[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:47.200]
And they're not one of not any single one of them has got any idea what they're talking about

[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:53.220]
Even though they can dazzle you with their bullcrap and with their alleged knowledge. They don't know what they're talking about

[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.280]
Including Abby Joseph Jaree a Karimla Jabara Schwartz Cohen

[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:04.020]
At the Goldman Sachs. Oh, yeah, there's no problem. That's 10,000. Maybe doubt 1000

[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:05.820]
Maybe she's got an extra

[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:07.780]
Maybe that's the problem

[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:12.780]
So I don't want to suggest that you should start hoarding cash like real soon like now

[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:16.300]
But that might be a real good idea

[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:19.020]

[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:33.320]
Just amazing. Go away for one week

[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:38.320]
Nine days everything was rolling along singing a song been kind of a desperate summer

[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.060]
But not the worst ever we somehow were managing come back here

[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:45.800]
It's like somebody just pulled a plug when you pull that plug out of the bathtub and all the water just go

[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.580]
Just get sucked right down here

[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:50.200]
Like one big gigantic suck job

[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:57.080]
Here's Pembert Pines. Hello. Hey, how's it going? Okay. Uh, you're going to the game tonight, right? Yes, sir

[00:58:57.080 --> 00:59:00.180]
I'm trying to get tickets. Uh, do you know if they have Panther packs?

[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:02.200]
Yeah, they do all they do

[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:06.160]
I don't know about for the exhibition game. I would assume they do they have them for all the other games

[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.040]
Yeah, I'd be good

[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:10.480]
Yeah, I bit to do you know, I mean let me take a look at the thing here

[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:14.500]
Tickets about 3000 remain as all it says, but it doesn't tell you anything about the

[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:16.120]
Yeah, it doesn't say price or anything

[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:21.900]
But they got tickets left that's good. I'm gonna. I've been there once on hockey fast. It was great. Yeah

[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:27.060]
But I'm just glad we got a great place to go now. I just hope we have a product on the ice that's the problem

[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:33.300]
No, I don't think so nothing at all less. A lot of these young kids. I mean, they're talking about this nilson kid and at the parish kid

[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:35.700]
And you know, we keep hearing about all these kids in the organization

[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:40.520]
And then they had a big article about radicte de Vorak yesterday about how he's maturing and he's a leader

[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:46.360]
You know, he showed me nothing last year. So it sounds to me like a lot of the same BS, but I'm hoping for the best. Oh, yeah

[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:49.960]
I mean, let's put it this way of course. Come to worst. We have all the other teams out there look forward to

All for mental help you. I don't know. It says like if you want to know about the bus schedule job

Detective John Rody said an officer spotted a posting on the internet September 22nd

[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.660]
Touting the food court restroom at the mall

[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.000]

Narendjo said it was too out on the restroom and the two instead agreed to meet a day deserted parking lot across the street from the mall

[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:43.000]
Once into parking lot Narendjo stepped into Rody's unmarked police car

[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.860]
Unzipped his pants again and started touching himself

[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:50.980]

I mean the people in the audience are laughing hysterically right now at you that's what they're laughing at because they know you're a bozo

[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:21.920]

How about things number one? Did you see the new thing that they're gonna be doing for football with the first down marker going across the field

[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:51.180]
There's must have a yellow stripe on the floor. The viewer can see it like they were trying to do with the hockey a yellow stripe

[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.100]
Yeah, oh

[01:18:54.600 --> 01:19:00.700]
Well, there's the there's the admission that the product sucks their finally that's the thing that Fox was doing when they put that glowing puck on there

[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:03.260]
What they were trying to say is the game is watered down in the sucks

[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:06.740]
We got to do something to juice it up and now the NFL is in the same thing

I'm having another great day in the big city right then bother me. I'll take the money. Thank you

[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:11.920]
I don't know if you've touched on it yet or I'm touching it right now with a story on the paper

[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:15.880]
I got my thumb on it. Yeah about looks like we might have to be polishing up our old

[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:18.560]
Gustaf and boots with jet bush getting support from

[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:22.820]
Really Logan that's right from one of those shards is yeah right on the front page

[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:26.640]
I mentioned that before nobody out here cares about it nobody this audience gives a crap

[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:32.100]
We got the Jewish journal endorsing jet bush the other day yesterday on yom kipper one of the greatest acts of

[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:36.180]
Blast for me in the history of the human race and today we got really Logan, which is no surprise

[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:41.880]
We already knew that because he's looking his wounds those aren't the Jews for Jesus people are they know these are the Jews for jester

[01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.780]
Um, I was that these are the Jews for masochism

[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:51.360]
I'd also like to thank you Neil for helping me

[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:56.880]
Maybe open up my mind a little bit, which I know is the point that you're just trying to get across to a lot of people

[01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:02.020]
That's uh, I've been reading a lot of books on uh, you know, on philosophy and on religion and stuff and

[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:06.580]
Just trying to get my mind made up. So let me ask you this seriously. Why is it so complicated?

[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.460]
Why do we need yeah, I was to come to work this morning

[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:15.240]
I was thinking about the guy that called me yesterday about Madeline O'Hara and her family like disappearing and about maybe they stole a bunch of money

[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:18.300]
Why does there need to be an American atheist organization?

[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:27.020]
I mean, I can understand you know the ACLU and organizations like Freedom from Religion Foundation that deal with legal matters that go into court to protect those from religious fanatics

[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:28.200]
I understand the need for them

[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:33.700]
But why does there have to be an atheist organization a Christian organization a Jewish organization

[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:37.720]
Well, what what does the need for it? Why can't you just believe whatever crap you want?

[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:42.860]
Just be a decent person don't bother anybody else. No harm. And that's it. What do we need all of this for?

[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:44.660]
There's nothing complicated about it

[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:49.020]
Nobody's going to heaven nobody's going to hell nobody's gonna have after life

[01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:52.320]
Nobody's gonna be coming back at you. It just uh, that's it

[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.260]
You know the whole point was with the whole thing

[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:58.420]
Especially you really see it in the really crazy, you know Muslim religions and stuff that

[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:02.660]
That the afterlife is really crazy religions like there's some that aren't

[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:05.180]
Oh, I guess okay all religions that you got

[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:10.040]
The Jews uh, yeah with the chickens on their head in Israel yesterday waiting to for the assay

[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:15.560]
They don't understand that it doesn't work from a down from of what they didn't have it look at the way water flows

[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:19.340]
Okay, the sins of the chicken are flowing down into their bodies

[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.120]
That's the problem of the orthodox Jews

[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:26.640]
That's why they're crazy than a bed book the sins of the chicken are in their brains now

[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.280]
The whole thing was related and eventually it flows all the way down and they turn into a bunch of chickens

[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:35.700]
This is what they turn out to be you know the whole thing is it just it's to me

[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:41.660]
It seems like it diminishes the life in what we have here on earth because it doesn't mean squat when you think about eternity

[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:46.420]
I mean what what eternity isn't every ridiculous. It's called fear of death

[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:52.200]
That's exactly what you go and step on a cockroach and you start and after you stop on that thing and kill it

[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.600]
Better than crap you ask yourself is that thing uh making a comeback?

[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:58.480]
I think it is gonna make a comeback. Yeah, that's the problem

[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:03.000]
Me I also like to uh, say we'll play hang up, but I think George is the next one job

[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.360]
He did a hell of a job and he's gonna be doing a show permanently starting tomorrow and uh, I know increase in pay and I'd like to

[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:13.200]
If possible maybe get his CD uh, what what are the chances of that? Best of George. That's coming out this week

[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:13.840]
Thank you

[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:16.520]
Okay, here's the best of George

[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:23.480]
Okay, we have an open line in date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t wireless line

[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:27.380]
We've been trying to tell you for a hundred years now. It's all a bunch of crap and you won't listen to us

[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:34.060]
Tells wrong with you people out there. Oh, I got a chicken on my head. Well, Jesus Christ even Carmen Miranda look better than that

[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:39.020]
They got a dead chicken on their head or maybe this is a dead chicken or a live chicken

[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:42.700]
I think it's a live chicken or a live chicken and they're waving it around

[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:49.400]
I give no meaning to the word chicken. Yeah, the sins of the chicken are flowing downward. Don't you understand?

[01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:53.960]
Now if they would stand on our head and put the chicken, which it don't work too good

[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:54.480]
I don't think

[01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:01.520]
That would be can you see that balancing act standing on your head on a live chicken? By the way, can multiple people use the same chicken

[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:08.260]
Multiple chickens or do you each have to have your own chicken only in Westland? How much sin can work in full?

[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:11.400]
60 WQC

[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:15.540]
The Neil Roger shale show me yours. I'll show you mine

[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:28.960]
Come on dux tv with the Dutch subtitles. There's Jerry Springer doing it baby with all those sparkes

[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:31.720]
You know good miserable. No good try that

[01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:34.900]
Oh

[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:39.720]
Over and over like 60 minutes or 58 minutes of that then Jerry comes on and kind of like a politicizes

[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:43.920]
Well, you do understand relationships are important. We have two open lines and brown earth

[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:49.280]
5 6 7 0 5 60 and pop 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:54.300]
We just figured out through in a break while there's so many smart Jews in the world most of them are egg heads from having at the

[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:55.920]
Yeah from having that chicken on your head

[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:00.680]
Right, how did I know in the very first words? Who that saw Miami little stick

[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:04.600]

[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:54.100]

God try it. You'll eat it. Oh, it's how many perks out there

[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:04.360]
You can enjoy Arizona. Don't go out the way. Yeah, but the people have run this

[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:09.700]
This Canyon Ranch because it's a big one. It's not enough to be hanging out in Arizona. You have to be over a hundred

[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:12.240]
Well, what I do is see I

[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:16.520]
I make statues for them and they give me room free. Yeah

[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:20.900]
I'm not free right I bought it and and they're gonna open a place in Vegas

[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:25.500]
We'll put the spa in in conjunction. You don't play school to volunteer

[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:30.000]
The guy was just talking about that. Oh, yeah. No, you're volunteer right

[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.860]
Well, Canyon Ranch is gonna have a piece of that. I mean the spa stuff like that

[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:37.600]
And they're healthy food and molecular uh-huh

[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:42.160]
I'm the guy that made it a little rave with me last year. Great. Oh, I final it every day

[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:45.300]
I'm squeezing it right now. Just thinking about it

[01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:50.000]
We want this year, man. Who I want what? Yeah, I will not look like we're sick with my rave wouldn't it?

[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:54.320]
That's good. No, no, no, I'm sticking with Ray. He's my man. He's

[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:59.480]
Hey, I can lend an eye so didn't see it when that you go right so see the after game

[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:04.460]
Sit in what do you mean when you sit sit in for me? What does that mean? I mean you said you wouldn't be able to go to the opening day

[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:08.060]
Okay, well, he just get cut off. Okay. We have an open line. I see now

[01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:12.980]
This is a very nice guy who made a nice thing for me, but you know something at this point in my life

[01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:16.500]
I'm just I'm becoming bitter. Am I becoming bitter? Uh-huh

[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:21.660]
Because I'm not giving away those tickets yet. I don't know for sure

[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:24.300]
I'm probably not going to be here next weekend not this weekend

[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:27.760]
We got of course the big thing at the borders and then Tuesday we got the thing at pizza law

[01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:32.820]
But to follow in weekend October like 9th and 10th and whatever those dates are

[01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:37.900]
I'm probably going to be out of town, but there's a chance I might not be all depending

[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:43.740]
And this guy who did a very nice thing for me he turns out to be a freeloader too

[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.700]
Can we sit on your tape? No

[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:49.900]
The answer is no

[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:56.540]
If you do something nice for me, don't do it because you're going to like out like in a godfather, you know

[01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:59.240]
You're going to come back for the funeral later on

[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:06.320]
And that they may never come but that better be better move but about your outsider and so on look how they master create my boy

[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:07.260]
You know all that business

[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:15.280]
Jesus I just it just because most people that do nice stuff for us here at a show they ask nothing and return

[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:17.840]
Self-help con Joe

[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:23.600]
Resoli all those people they ask nothing and return Gary the sign man nice people

[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:27.740]
You know they don't want nothing to read what they don't want anything to return

[01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:34.160]
But then it's just because I mentioned I mean she I don't want any tickets

[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:37.260]
I don't want to go to any ball games. I'm just going to lock myself in a house

[01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:44.140]
Because this god damn town there is nothing there's nothing else here, but freeloaders. That's all we've got

[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:48.320]
That's the name of this town. What do you got? What do you got? What do you I got nothing?

[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:52.520]
I got nothing. How about your dog? He'd wrap a good come on. I'll take it

[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:56.160]
Jesus Christ

[01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:00.840]
You can't even joke about these things

[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:06.420]
I mean god forbid that I should make a joke about those tickets and right away I wouldn't within a matter

[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:08.680]
You can't buy a god damn call all day long

[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:14.460]
But as soon as you make some comment even obviously jokingly about hockey tickets or basket

[01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:18.300]
How about some tickets for the NBA they're not even playing for Christ sake. Oh

[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:22.840]
Oh, you'll take them I thought you would

[01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:29.280]
60 wq amp preacher shoots himself during sermon

[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:35.800]
Jacksonville a youth minister was in critical condition saturday when after accidentally shooting himself in the head

[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:39.680]
During a sermon as he waved to gun and compared Russian roulette with sin

[01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:43.460]
Melvin nurse and boy he could assure you one

[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:48.680]
35 was at university medical center after shattering his skull with a blank when the

[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:50.740]
37 caliber handgun discharge

[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:56.100]
He fired and then he fell. I thought it was part of the sermon that he was supposed to fall said Anthony spate

[01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:59.300]
Pastor at the living wake Christian fellowship church international

[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:04.760]
But I got up there. I stopped water the carpet the congregate said pastor. This is real something's happened

[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:07.960]
I began to pray for him and add someone called the fire station next door

[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:11.980]
Nurse had fired the gun over his head several times about it going off

[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:14.860]
So the shooting caught the congregation by surprise

[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:19.360]
He was using Russian roulette to make a point about the consequences of sin

[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:25.560]
Witnesses said the ministers said the nurse opened the gun cylinder and inserted a blank sponus cylinder

[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:29.340]
Each time he discussed a specific sin he'd repeat the same motion

[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:33.700]
Though a blank the casing still contains a hard cardboard type wide

[01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:37.740]
That ejects several feet when fired police said

[01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:40.140]
New police nor church members knew who owned a gun

[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:45.160]
Spate said nurse often preached about the dangers of crack cocaine and sweet car crime

[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:48.080]
But he has to give a sermon on Thursday about gun use and sin

[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:52.080]
Spate said he allowed nurse to give the sermon in lieu of a weekly Bible study session

[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.600]
But didn't know nurse had a gun

[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.780]
He was nursing it

[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:58.100]
Nurse had been preaching for a short time when he took a gun out of a small case

[01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:02.780]
And referred to a passage in the New Testament book of James that deals with sin and death spate said

[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:04.200]
I think it deals with guns

[01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:06.660]
Oh, they didn't have no guns back then today

[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:08.720]
Geez they couldn't have had too good of a time

[01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:14.600]
No one they were always writing about sin and all that crap, huh? They didn't have no guns. Let me have it a good time

[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.720]

I know that strikes you particularly hard because you're such a militant Cuban, but nevertheless

[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:43.500]
If that's what it takes if that's what it's we've got to deal with no lojolios on here

[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:46.520]
Because there isn't there's not one

Every maybe five months one in five months. We got a holy or a call this show

[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:53.720]
That's got anything except those little pranks or we'll get our own bull grow. That's it

[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:14.080]

Yeah, how you doing? Okay. I want to go see the arena. Yeah, and I'm a supporter of you on those lights

[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:34.020]
I can't believe they use the same life with the arena. I think they just transferred them over

[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:37.040]
They still got the same little dinky redled red gold ball

[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:40.380]
Yeah, I think they just moved them over. They just decided not to spend the extra money

[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:43.380]
I don't know ridiculous. It's been all that money on that on that uh

[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:46.760]
Have any people ever been to a hockey game in like a real arena? No

[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:50.640]
All they have to do is watch a Canadian channel. I mean, yeah, they don't even have to go

[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:52.480]
They're going to watch a Toronto game or

[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:54.980]
A Canadian game come on

[01:44:55.880 --> 01:45:00.000]
Right they have the correct life or even in Tampa even as you read next over there

[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.840]
I know how to have a goal. I said they want to go to school

[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:04.340]
It like looks impressive and exciting and the like

[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:09.660]
They're like something goes on instead of like a little dinky Christmas ball goes on like at the arena

[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:10.480]

Um happy for the coach that he's funny in other place to go. You know more power to him

[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:23.060]
We disappointed him. I think we've really legged down

[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:28.100]
Even though the team played well last year but uh all the scoops that these people did you know in the management

[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:32.460]
You know more power to him, you know let him go and do whatever he has to do. Thank God bless Jim Leland

These are animal squeezers man. I mean they're out of their minds. I don't understand how come

And they're worried about a chicken being dressed up, you know being chased and being fried

I mean, I hate to break the news to them. Guess what chickens do wind up on the grill. Okay. Why don't you remember every day?

[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:18.500]
Remember the commercial with the cows they were shooting at the chicken sirens or whatever the heck it was back then for beef or

[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:20.820]
Chicken or how come they didn't get upset about that?

[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:27.800]
Beats a hell out of me. I don't know. Anyway, any other thing is I read the paper. Yes, maybe they're maybe they're in the wrong religion

[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:32.820]
Uh, I read in the paper yesterday something about that there's gonna be hard to get cell phone calls and

[01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:38.280]
Yeah, so what's what's the big deal these people can't do it out there?

[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:42.360]
So I'm gonna say I'm glad you mentioned that because I was gonna talk about that the other day

[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:45.800]
I am so ecstatic that it's gonna be there's nothing that is

[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:50.920]
Phoneier or more below anyer than watching assholes on cell phones at a sporting event

[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:55.440]
I can understand if it's a doctor if it's an emergency call which usually they have a beeper

[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:01.980]
But uh, but other than that assholes on cell phones it at hockey games and sporting events those people make me want a bar

[01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:07.640]

[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:24.760]
Oh

Hound

[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:31.300]

[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:31.300]

[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:32.800]
Man

[01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:41.980]
is not the existence I wanted.

[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:46.300]
Someone's gonna find us.

[01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:49.240]
Back's back to pocket chains.

[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:52.300]
Our containers decomposed.

[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:56.600]
I shoulda give you some phenopharbit, tall.

[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:01.560]
So don't get me some phenopharbit, tall.

[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.280]
We'd vodka and some apple sauce.

[01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:09.840]
Shots totally into math.

[01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:10.980]
Oh, sucks.

[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:12.240]
The way it's held back.

[01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:16.600]
When we join our nucks, got shot then we waited for

[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:17.520]
Hey, hope up.

[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:19.480]
We for a.

[01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:21.100]
Hope up.

[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:26.600]
The end of the head explain now we meet up with our space

[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:27.000]
plate.

[01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:30.360]
Right on the space plate.

[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:33.120]
Just means you could still be.

[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:36.480]
I don't know.

[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.280]
I didn't know Brian Andrews was Jewish by the way.

[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:39.540]
Do you hear what they were talking about on Channel

[01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:42.440]
7 last night that he was wandering around the studios with the.

[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:44.720]
On his head.

[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:51.420]
We have two open lines in date 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line.

[01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:53.520]
Sure missed that old Brian Andrews.

[01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:54.720]
What's that in your mouth?

[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:56.780]
Here's a coconut grove.

[01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:57.000]
Hello.

[01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:58.260]
I know.

[01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:00.160]
I like to know when you're going to be at border.

[01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:01.140]
Saturday.

[01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:03.020]
Okay, because I have a gift for you.

[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:03.420]
Saturday.

[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:04.540]
Saturday no.

[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:05.660]
Two borders in the gallery.

[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:07.540]
Gallery, wasn't it?

[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:08.880]
Where is it?

[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:09.280]
Yeah.

[01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:11.660]
East sunrise over by the beach right by the gallery.

[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:12.980]
It's a mall.

[01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:16.080]
Well, it's it's a free stanny, but it's next to the gallery.

[01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:16.980]
Okay.

[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:17.600]
What time?

[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:18.000]
No.

[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:18.260]
No.

[01:52:18.860 --> 01:52:19.760]
Okay, I'll see you there.

[01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:20.220]
I'll be there.

[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:20.560]
All right.

[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:23.840]
Okay, we have two open lines in date 5 6 7 0 5 60.

[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:25.360]
Oh, we finally got some cigars.

[01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:27.320]
We threatened to start smoking other brands.

[01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:28.980]
And John penis.

[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:29.980]
Yes, I could use a cutter.

[01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:30.720]
It would be very nice.

[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:35.080]
I don't want to like just chew off the end like some kind of a disgusting, you know, like

[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:35.880]
some old red neck.

[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:38.220]
Just chop off the old end, spit it out.

[01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:40.060]
All the way to us, spit it out.

[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:41.400]
Oh, yeah.

[01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:42.160]
Oh, yeah.

[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:44.140]
You never know what you're getting into these days.

[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:45.600]
You know, you got to be real careful.

[01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:47.580]
Okay, let's see.

[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:53.360]
Do a little clip here on my, on my part, doma reserve, numero, uno.

[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:54.100]
There we go.

[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:55.500]
Now I feel like a real man.

[01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:58.180]
I wonder we couldn't get any goddamn calls on his short last three days.

[01:52:58.180 --> 01:52:59.760]
We're smoking a bunch of bogus cigars.

[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:03.540]
How do I can people respect you when you got a bunch of crap in your mouth, huh?

[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:05.300]
Put something good in there.

[01:53:05.420 --> 01:53:06.120]
Look at our deadlines.

[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:08.380]
Look at them go out as soon as I lift the stoke up.

[01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:12.740]
5 6 7 0 5 60, pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line.

[01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:14.560]
Or we're supposed to say Miami date County.

[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:15.360]
Maybe that'll do it, huh?

[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:20.900]
305 5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the 18 T whatever that is.

[01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:22.160]
Here's Miami.

[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:22.500]
Hello.

[01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:24.640]
Miami.

[01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:27.400]
Okay, let's try a mobile.

[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:28.280]
It was Palm Beach.

[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:28.500]
Hello.

[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:30.580]
Hey, Neil. How you doing?

[01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:31.160]
Okay, sir.

[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:36.560]
I heard you mentioned today this morning about, they're losing the red line for this game tonight.

[01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:37.040]
Mm hmm.

[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:40.480]
And that's probably not going to fly.

[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:41.640]
And I hope it doesn't fly.

[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:42.840]
It's stupid.

[01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:45.560]
And I'm pissed off that they're doing that again that I'm going to go to.

[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:46.760]
What a wasted time.

[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:49.720]
Well, I mean, if they want to resort to the roller hockey crap,

[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:51.440]
let them go ahead and do that to that game.

[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:52.960]
This is the real game.

[01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:53.180]
Right.

[01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:53.700]
Just leave it alone.

[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:59.080]
But what I wanted to ask you was, and I had heard that they were going to go back to the standard size crease.

[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:02.880]
Yeah, well, not the standard size crease.

[01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:04.380]
They've chopped off the edges.

[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:05.620]
Oh, okay.

[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:07.020]
So they're going to square it up again.

[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:08.360]
It's still going to have a blue thing.

[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:10.760]
No, they're not going to, let me say it again, they're not squaring it up.

[01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:15.440]
They've chopped off the edges on either side of the, uh, the, uh, uh, uh, post.

[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:16.380]
Of the wall.

[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:16.660]
Okay.

[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:18.380]
They don't have that overlap on the post.

[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:18.680]
Right.

[01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:19.560]
Okay.

[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:22.920]
Now they're going to extend the back ends behind the net.

[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:26.240]
They said they're going to widen that that area.

[01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:28.280]
Supposedly, they've already done that.

[01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:29.120]
Really?

[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:29.640]
Yeah.

[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:36.260]
Because I'd say if you want to open up a hockey game like, you know, like the European, that's one of the changes they made this year is that they moved it.

[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:39.160]
I forget how many feet out from the, uh, from the boards.

[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:42.120]
Well, that'll work because they'll take guys like Ray with you, man.

[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:43.780]
That'll open their game wide open.

[01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:44.060]
Yeah.

[01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:47.260]
You know, I don't say too much about Ray Whitney.

[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:49.620]
You know, how these guys are like the other day.

[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:52.820]
I had my fingers crossed just like you, man.

[01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:56.520]
Right after they signed them as like, come on, come on, don't screw this up.

[01:54:57.260 --> 01:54:59.960]
But anyhow, I'm out of material meal and closing.

[01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:03.220]
DJ, you're a gold-tending douchebag.

[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:03.980]
Okay, see you pal.

[01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:04.640]
See you there tonight.

[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:09.500]
Okay, we have one call left in the board and then it's, uh, mo-con, baby.

[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:18.660]
Well, I guess five six seven, oh five sixty, that's our toll free number for any place in a goddamn world.

[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000]
Come five sixty on the 18 to wireless life for you, uh, cell phone people.

[01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:30.260]
Here's Tamarack. Hello.

[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:31.820]
Now, yes, sir.

[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:36.100]
I had some lady complaining about you at the young kick-or-service is the other day.

[01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:36.360]
Good.

[01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:36.840]
Incredible.

[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:38.800]
Okay, great guy with the eyes.

[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:40.620]
Guy with the eyes.

[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:41.280]
How do you like that?

[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:42.400]
That's how desperate we are.

[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:46.720]
We got the old guy with his $25 million bet that Clinton's going to get the impeach.

[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:48.400]
And then we got the guy with the eyes.

[01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:52.480]
We got the guy with hockey is, uh, is soccer on eyes as a skate or whatever.

[01:55:52.600 --> 01:56:00.560]
His one line is you are the most useless, the most pathetic, the most unbelievable audience in the history of the human race.

[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:01.800]
It's, it's just pathetic.

[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:04.900]
All I keep thinking about is that paycheck.

[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:15.260]
That's the only thing that drives me that forces me that continues to a cause me to go through the motions of getting into that Corvette and showing up in this place every morning and doing this exercise.

[01:56:15.940 --> 01:56:19.360]
Because this week, as of this week, it ceased to be a radio show.

[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:22.580]
It's now an exercise and agonizing exercise.

[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:27.760]
One line left on the board here is a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:29.900]
Hello.

[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:31.800]
Mobile in Miami, yes, sir.

[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:32.760]
Hey, thanks.

[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:37.680]
Um, I think just a couple things would you continue to bash the bush, please?

[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:43.360]
Meaning jet bush, of course, because I can't stand the guy and everything you say about it.

[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:51.560]
These people don't care about jet bush, Willie Logan, the Jewish journal, no matter what I, what it is that I have to say about it, they got no retort, no response, no interest.

[01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:54.100]
None. And that's why he's going to win in a landslide.

[01:56:54.100 --> 01:57:00.220]
A man who's never been elected dog catcher, he's going to be the governor of the state in a landslide because these people couldn't care less.

[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:04.960]
I'm afraid you're right, but just keep on bashing the bush once a day if you don't mind.

[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:07.100]
Another thing, you know how it shows up.

[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:14.540]
I can't believe that New York, mass crazy, the cause of some down and that's supposedly the highest rated radio show.

[01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:22.520]
All I got news for is the highest rated radio show in this market, two hours got an 11.8 share in the last trend that just came out and is making more money than God.

[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:27.980]
So what can I tell you how it's doing? Okay, and I guarantee that if Howard opened up the phones, I was asking for people to call him.

[01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:36.460]
He wouldn't be sitting there begging and pleading and carrying on day after day with a highly rated legend show like we're doing here with one call on the board.

[01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:44.500]
Just really pathetic two open lines and date all three lines in power to these people have anything to say about anything.

[01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:45.800]
No, they're out of material.

[01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:51.720]
We used to get guys at the end of a call and say I'm out of material. I'll see you now the whole audience collectively.

[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:56.720]
She just opened up their window and yell out the window. We're out of material. Have a great life.

[01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:04.480]

Well, what do you mean check it out? What is there to check out?

Oh, well, did you I think you're a CB and a tape. He was a comedian. Are you dead now?

[01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:33.160]
But who is Bill? Bill Hick. Bill Hick. Bill Hick. I thought you were talking about an old hockey player. You used to play with a Rochester Amherst.

[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:36.400]
No, no. Yeah, you mentioned that before. I'm going to have a more name.

[01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:39.120]
No, I haven't checked it out, pal, but I'll get to it one of these years.

[01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:46.060]

Neil. Yes, sir. I heard a promo for you this morning from you this morning. You're talking about Don and Bob's.

[01:58:52.960 --> 01:59:00.740]
Yeah. You know that they recovered the Naga hide and I believe they sold it to some lawyer.

[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:06.380]
I think, but they, you know, the place you got all new Naga hide. It used to have the holes in there.

[01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:15.500]
What do you mean the holes? The holes in a Naga hide. I can always think of all the high school kids using those holes.

[01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:19.560]
And then they went and put a brand new cover over everything.

[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:23.620]
Yeah. The high school kids were using the holes for what?

[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:31.500]
I see your option. Yeah. I must have never said on those spots. I would say.

[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:35.680]
Oh, don't give me that needle. What? I went up my wife went to Brighton.

[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:39.580]
Well, we're going to have an argument about whether they had holes in the seats that Don and Bob's.

[01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:42.300]
No, the argument is whether you ever use them or not.

[01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:44.800]
Oh, whether I use the holes. Yeah, I used to use them all the time.

[01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:47.880]
Okay. Okay. Thanks for the good news, sir.

[01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:49.800]
What is this man talking about?

[01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:55.240]
For even having assholes called in here about the Naga hide at Don and Bob's on Monroe Avenue and Rochester.

[01:59:55.240 --> 02:00:01.240]
Oh, man, yet too much of that goddamn chocolate almond for a fudge frozen custard for you, pal.

[02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:18.360]
Here did the high school kids are doing their humping the holes in the seats. Right.

[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:21.940]
You'll see this guy at Westland and his name will be in a paper next year.

[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:22.740]
I guarantee you that.

[02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:28.140]
In fact, as soon as this guy walks into Don and Bob, they say we don't want you're doing.

of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of our little bit of a little bit of our little bit of a little bit of a little bit of water, and now let's get out first. Hey, Zoe, where are you guys coming to this class? Super Uh-Ring in the room.ide of water, see you guys...

[02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:57.120]

[02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:57.120]

[02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:57.720]
As have been on the internet, I had empieza a short way, and our hands were hairy.

[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:01.440]
It's alone not being able to sell its house for 27.5 million.

[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:01.880]
Who?

[02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:03.820]
You got to...slice, alone.

[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:04.260]
Yeah.

[02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:06.460]
The same asshole as yesterday.

[02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:11.180]
Okay, we have an open line in Broward, two of them, and all of a day.

[02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:13.820]
One call on the board. One lonely call after this asshole.

[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:15.540]
I call yesterday with the same week material.

[02:15:15.860 --> 02:15:17.640]
Oh, well, this time was clear enough I could understand it.

[02:15:17.740 --> 02:15:19.560]
Thank you very much, sir, for getting a better phone.

[02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:23.920]
56670560 and pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:28.800]
Here's the Fort Lauderdale, hello.

[02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:43.120]
Here's a mobile in Cooper City, hello.

[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:44.740]
Oh, hi, Neil.

[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:45.320]
Yes, sir.

[02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:48.560]
Did you touch on...I don't have a lot of stuff.

[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:49.100]
I touched it.

[02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:52.300]
Did you touch on the damn Quizz and Berry Dying today?

[02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:53.460]
Who?

[02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:57.020]
Dan Quizz and Berry used the pitch for the Kansas City Royale.

[02:15:57.040 --> 02:15:58.460]
Oh, yeah, he died at the age of 45.

[02:15:58.660 --> 02:15:58.960]
I saw it.

[02:15:59.100 --> 02:16:02.040]
Well, when you see that I touch on it, what is there to discuss?

[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:03.720]
Well, I'll just be glad.

[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:04.360]
He had a brown thing or something.

[02:16:04.620 --> 02:16:06.560]
Yeah, he was a super pitcher.

[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:10.380]
And Neil, I'm just trying to call it a failure board, buddy.

[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:11.460]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:12.180]
You're welcome, sir.

[02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:13.220]
And to say how to Dan.

[02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:17.720]
Well, you know, he's in that big baseball diamond in the sky somewhere.

[02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:20.040]
He's up there with the jury diamond up there in the sky.

[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:21.880]
We have an open line in Dave.

[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:22.400]
One in a row.

[02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:25.240]
At 5.6.7.0.5.60.5.60 on him.

[02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:28.340]
I guess what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to go back to polls.

[02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:31.600]
We'll have to come up with topics like bandage killed four hours yesterday.

[02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:32.540]
I knew.

[02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:33.740]
I knew what he was doing at.

[02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:35.680]
It was really a different drag.

[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:39.780]
Four hours on how come you're not watching Monday at football anymore.

[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:41.480]
How come the ratings are not what they used to be, etc.

[02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:41.900]
And so on.

[02:16:42.100 --> 02:16:43.500]
When in four seconds you could say,

[02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:44.620]
because the game is tough.

[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:45.400]
That's why.

[02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:48.300]
Because people don't want to watch a crappy product.

[02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:49.020]
There you go.

[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:51.800]
Here's a mobile in Kendall.

[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:52.120]
Hello.

[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:53.420]
Any odds of going.

[02:16:53.620 --> 02:16:53.900]
Okay.

[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:57.340]
All right. I guess nobody's in Miami is just a quick response.

[02:16:57.340 --> 02:16:59.700]
I guess there's still scared of a jury still coming by.

[02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:00.840]
Hurricane George.

[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:03.500]
There's been scared by Branko across there anyway.

[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:09.000]
I wanted to touch upon what was it that happened about baseball.

[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:13.580]
What's happened with a Dave County's open 5.6.7.0.5.60.

[02:17:13.580 --> 02:17:15.220]
on a mobile one line.

[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:18.160]
It's so you keep putting that same jackass on over and over.

[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:19.300]
That's one of yours again.

[02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:22.120]
You think of me the same one.

[02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:23.760]
They're all the same.

[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:25.080]
They're all it's one person.

[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:25.440]
Okay.

[02:17:25.740 --> 02:17:28.420]
It's one person in about 50 million different bodies.

[02:17:28.660 --> 02:17:30.020]
It's all the same little person.

[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:32.540]
Here's Tamarack. Hello.

[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:33.480]
Neil.

[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:34.020]
Yes, sir.

[02:17:34.220 --> 02:17:34.700]
Okay.

[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:37.640]
A few weeks back you were talking about an issue.

[02:17:37.700 --> 02:17:40.520]
Travel leisure magazine with the top cities to visit.

[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:41.140]
Yes sir.

[02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:44.380]
I wasn't the top cities to visit it was the top cities in the world.

[02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:46.220]
Allegedly, here we are.

[02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:47.340]
You know, we're going to get that.

[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:49.920]
I was at San Evan, the public's when Dixie Eckers, Walgreens,

[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.800]
and went to a new stand today and I couldn't get it.

[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:55.560]
I did see a travel leisure magazine today but it said fall and winter issue.

[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:57.160]
I thought you said it was like a September issue.

[02:17:57.440 --> 02:17:58.020]
Yeah, whatever.

[02:17:58.500 --> 02:17:59.660]
Well, whatever one is out now.

[02:17:59.700 --> 02:18:00.660]
That's the one that it's in.

[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:03.780]
Okay, because you know, you wasn't on the cover.

[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:04.680]
Did you look on the cover?

[02:18:04.820 --> 02:18:05.360]
What did it say?

[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:07.340]
Yeah, it didn't say anything about that.

[02:18:07.340 --> 02:18:08.020]
Then you ride a look.

[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:09.180]
Okay, can't get it.

[02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:12.840]
We have an open line in Broward all in Dade County, all 20 or 500 lines in Dade.

[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:14.740]
5, 6, 7, I'm not going to do this.

[02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:17.840]
I'm going to play some music, relax, do some of my commercial breaks.

[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:20.200]
I worked my ass off these three days.

[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:23.220]
I've done about 600 days work in these last three days.

[02:18:23.220 --> 02:18:24.080]
Is it been worth it?

[02:18:24.180 --> 02:18:24.340]
No.

[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:24.840]
Of course not.

[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:29.480]
Me talk about the inverse proportion of, you know, something in and something out.

[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:31.640]
You've been so good to me.

[02:18:31.820 --> 02:18:32.180]
Oh yeah.

[02:18:32.180 --> 02:18:36.440]
This world where mine.

[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:41.800]
I'd give you the flowers.

[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:44.280]
The birds end up being.

[02:18:44.780 --> 02:18:47.160]
I'm just sitting here, standing in my mind.

[02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:47.680]
It's connected.

[02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:48.740]
You'll be being up there.

[02:18:49.620 --> 02:18:50.240]
You to come.

[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:52.000]
I'd give you anything.

[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:54.040]
Why, it's connected.

[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:55.340]
I beat dynamite up there.

[02:18:55.700 --> 02:18:56.720]
But baby.

[02:18:57.420 --> 02:19:00.680]
So I'm sitting here with my microphone open and I think on the ears, is on the ear out there.

[02:19:00.740 --> 02:19:01.260]
What is it, David?

[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:03.540]
Danny wants to answer what?

[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:07.720]
Danny wants to dance for me?

[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:08.040]
No.

[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:11.460]
The shoes on too, what?

[02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:18.160]
It's the TV show when you come right down to it.

[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:22.140]
It's, I don't want to get them up sick because they're already like on the way out.

[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:25.680]
They're already all, yeah, just an inch away from the unemployment line.

[02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:28.640]
And of course we are going to have a real bad recession, guys.

[02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:29.580]
I don't want to get you depressed.

[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:34.300]
I don't want to get you like down and out and hit you below the belt when it really hurts the most.

[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:35.740]
But you know, it's what it is.

[02:19:36.540 --> 02:19:38.680]
Because they're phasing us out there on whammy.

[02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:40.360]
We're phasing us out here on Q&A.

[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:43.580]
The audience is phasing me out of their lives and I can understand, I can relate to it.

[02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:45.040]
I still got a few nickels to rub together.

[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:47.420]
126 is 5K.

[02:19:47.420 --> 02:19:52.440]
We have an open line, a date one and an an anemobo one line.

[02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:54.000]
Here's a mobile in line.

[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:54.420]
Hello.

[02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:55.640]
Neil.

[02:19:55.880 --> 02:19:56.180]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:56.580 --> 02:19:57.020]
How you doing?

[02:19:57.840 --> 02:19:58.880]
I don't want to be a chronic.

[02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:02.440]
This is the third time I've called since you came over to QAM.

[02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:02.840]
Yeah.

[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:05.220]
Okay, that doesn't qualify me as a chronic.

[02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:06.020]
No, it sure doesn't.

[02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:13.940]
Well, in the midst of all the excitement about the hurricane, Rick Fancho has had a classic line as only he can have.

[02:20:14.100 --> 02:20:15.800]
Yeah, thank God it wasn't a human's, yeah.

[02:20:16.060 --> 02:20:17.280]
That was an economic problem.

[02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:17.980]
Something like that.

[02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:21.380]
He said that after we've had 600 reports on it.

[02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:23.360]
I don't want to get a feel bad, but we've heard it.

[02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:24.220]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

[02:20:24.220 --> 02:20:25.100]
It's okay, don't be sorry.

[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:27.700]
Are you going to go to borders anytime soon?

[02:20:28.260 --> 02:20:28.400]
No.

[02:20:28.860 --> 02:20:29.260]
No?

[02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:29.780]
No.

[02:20:30.220 --> 02:20:31.140]
Okay, thanks.

[02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:35.040]
Okay, we have two open lines in date two and anemobo.

[02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:39.260]
56670560, don't forget we'll be in borders by the gallery and four-letter day.

[02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:40.540]
This is Saturday, noon to two.

[02:20:40.940 --> 02:20:43.380]
And pizza love next to the October 6th, 6th, 8th, VM.

[02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:46.300]
Call me again in three years, pal.

[02:20:46.900 --> 02:20:47.740]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:48.080]
Hello.

[02:20:50.260 --> 02:20:51.200]
Lady in Miami.

[02:20:53.880 --> 02:20:54.280]
Hello.

[02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:54.860]
Yes?

[02:20:56.300 --> 02:20:57.300]
Hello, is Neal on?

[02:20:57.520 --> 02:20:57.840]
Speaking.

[02:20:58.320 --> 02:20:59.260]
How are you today?

[02:20:59.460 --> 02:20:59.740]
Okay.

[02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:02.560]
Just wanted to give you a little prediction.

[02:21:03.620 --> 02:21:03.840]
Yes?

[02:21:05.220 --> 02:21:06.700]
This is the first time I called you.

[02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:07.300]
Uh-huh.

[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:15.660]
And we just want to say that we know that the Christian, the Christian moral majority will get you off the air.

[02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:16.140]
Oh, really?

[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:17.080]
Yeah, this year.

[02:21:17.420 --> 02:21:18.080]
This year?

[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:18.580]
Yeah.

[02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:19.640]
How are you going to do that?

[02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:22.520]
Ah, because the Christians are the majority.

[02:21:23.380 --> 02:21:27.340]
Well, what the Christian majority, so called, has been trying to get me off the air for 20 years.

[02:21:27.480 --> 02:21:27.800]
You know what?

[02:21:28.020 --> 02:21:28.920]
I'm still here, sweetheart.

[02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:29.860]
We.

[02:21:30.220 --> 02:21:31.120]
We haven't given up yet.

[02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:32.080]
You haven't given up?

[02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:33.080]
Well, let me ask you something.

[02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:34.580]
Why don't you find something better to do?

[02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:36.080]
Like, go help some starving people.

[02:21:36.380 --> 02:21:37.580]
Go feed some of the homeless people.

[02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:39.060]
How do you know I don't?

[02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:42.040]
I'm positive you don't, because if you're busy listening to the show every day,

[02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:45.480]
worried about getting radio shows off here, you don't have time to be doing anything productive.

[02:21:45.800 --> 02:21:45.980]
Oh.

[02:21:46.140 --> 02:21:47.080]
I'm a good Christian lady.

[02:21:47.420 --> 02:21:48.460]
I'm a good Christian lady.

[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:50.080]
No, you sound like a bigoted bitch to me.

[02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:50.540]
Oh.

[02:21:51.100 --> 02:21:51.460]
Oh.

[02:21:53.440 --> 02:21:53.800]
Yes?

[02:21:54.080 --> 02:21:56.000]
You don't think you won't be off the air by then, do you?

[02:21:56.220 --> 02:21:58.620]
I guarantee you, but your life on it that I won't.

[02:21:58.620 --> 02:22:00.420]
Well, we'll see what the Christian majority can do.

[02:22:00.420 --> 02:22:01.400]
Oh, we'll see what that was.

[02:22:01.460 --> 02:22:04.020]
The Christian majority, because I've never quite heard that term before.

[02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:05.200]
I've heard of the moral majority.

[02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:06.540]
I've heard of the Christian coalition.

[02:22:07.080 --> 02:22:08.560]
I've heard of the American Family Association.

[02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:09.960]
The Florida family is a...

[02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:10.820]
The Christian majority.

[02:22:10.820 --> 02:22:12.400]
Is that something you just made up in your mind?

[02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:12.600]

[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:14.200]
The Christian moral majority.

[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:15.620]
Oh, the Christian moral majority.

[02:22:15.740 --> 02:22:16.820]
The Christian oral majority?

[02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:17.220]
Oral majority?

[02:22:17.220 --> 02:22:17.460]
Oral.

[02:22:17.660 --> 02:22:17.940]
Yes.

[02:22:17.940 --> 02:22:18.380]
Yeah?

[02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:19.780]
Oral, is that what you said?

[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:20.500]
No.

[02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:21.620]
Yes, you do.

[02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:23.080]
I didn't say that.

[02:22:23.180 --> 02:22:23.920]
You take it up the...

[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:24.300]
Breakfast room.

[02:22:24.500 --> 02:22:25.120]
You also do that?

[02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:26.040]
You're very mad.

[02:22:26.180 --> 02:22:27.420]
No, I just want to know the truth.

[02:22:27.620 --> 02:22:28.180]
That's all the truth.

[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:29.000]
You'll set you free.

[02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:29.740]
Oh, okay.

[02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:31.260]
You enjoy sex in the breakfast room.

[02:22:31.580 --> 02:22:31.740]
No.

[02:22:32.060 --> 02:22:32.480]
You don't?

[02:22:32.660 --> 02:22:32.880]
No.

[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:33.960]
Well, maybe you'll try it.

[02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:34.260]
No.

[02:22:34.700 --> 02:22:35.100]
Oh, yes.

[02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:35.580]
No.

[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:36.400]
I think so.

[02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:37.740]
Why do you say that?

[02:22:37.740 --> 02:22:38.620]
You know what it says in the Bible?

[02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:39.980]
Those who say, uh...

[02:22:39.980 --> 02:22:40.160]
No.

[02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:41.220]
What they really mean is...

[02:22:41.220 --> 02:22:41.440]
Uh-huh.

[02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:42.440]
That's not true.

[02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:44.520]
That's what it says right there in Leviticus.

[02:22:44.700 --> 02:22:44.820]
Where?

[02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:47.120]
Roy, right on the first page.

[02:22:47.320 --> 02:22:47.940]
Uh-huh.

[02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:50.900]
You better go read your Bible, sweetheart.

[02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:51.700]
You don't know crap.

[02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:54.560]
The Christian moral majority.

[02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:55.920]
Right, we're going to get you off the ear.

[02:22:56.180 --> 02:22:58.780]
It took like 30 seconds to get her to untwist the phone

[02:22:58.780 --> 02:23:00.700]
from her thing before I could finally get her to say hello.

[02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:02.480]
There you go.

[02:23:02.800 --> 02:23:04.120]
Dave County's wide open fives.

[02:23:04.220 --> 02:23:05.340]
That's what we get from Dave County.

[02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:07.420]
That's our contribution from Dave County today.

[02:23:07.540 --> 02:23:07.660]
Oh!

[02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:08.960]
That bitch.

[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:13.760]
566-705-60 and pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:17.200]
I'm going to show up tomorrow just in spite of you, okay, honey?

[02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:19.320]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[02:23:19.500 --> 02:23:19.660]
Hello.

[02:23:20.100 --> 02:23:20.720]
Hello, Neil.

[02:23:20.860 --> 02:23:21.240]
Yes, sir.

[02:23:21.920 --> 02:23:23.940]
Look, I want to tell you about the biggest shambles

[02:23:23.940 --> 02:23:25.780]
that were pulled by Wolley Logan.

[02:23:26.320 --> 02:23:29.040]
You know, there was another Wolley Logan for the politicians.

[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.600]
And this one, the rent out of Opharata.

[02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:34.280]
They never had a meeting.

[02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:36.220]
They never had a personal appearance.

[02:23:36.220 --> 02:23:38.920]
And he got a look on the other men's names.

[02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:41.480]
He can hear about Opharata.

[02:23:41.720 --> 02:23:41.920]
Yeah.

[02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:43.000]
He never had a meeting.

[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:45.120]
Well, I'll send it back to Opharata.

[02:23:45.280 --> 02:23:46.240]
It's a good place for him, okay?

[02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:47.500]
Him and the abushmyster.

[02:23:48.040 --> 02:23:48.860]
Max made in heaven.

[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:49.580]
We have an open line.

[02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:50.600]
And Dave wanted to be rowered.

[02:23:50.680 --> 02:23:54.040]
566-705-60, pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[02:23:55.280 --> 02:23:56.400]
Here's a mobile in sunrise.

[02:23:56.640 --> 02:23:56.780]
Hello.

[02:23:57.700 --> 02:24:00.020]
Hey, maybe that lady earlier should get in the wreck.

[02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:01.140]
Maybe she'll be a little happier.

[02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:02.920]
No, she's taken in the wreck.

[02:24:02.960 --> 02:24:03.680]
Don't worry about that.

[02:24:03.860 --> 02:24:04.300]
You think so.

[02:24:04.300 --> 02:24:06.060]
All those Christians, they love it.

[02:24:06.120 --> 02:24:08.160]
Yeah, well, the jury from the majority said you're going to stay.

[02:24:08.380 --> 02:24:09.660]
So that's more important down here.

[02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:11.760]
Yeah, I can talk about the response this week.

[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:12.600]
I'm going to stay, Max.

[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:13.480]
Don't be thinking about that.

[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:18.200]
I was curious if you went to any of the Panther exhibition again.

[02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:19.200]
I'm going tonight.

[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:20.800]
Did you go to the one before?

[02:24:21.020 --> 02:24:21.580]
No, I did not.

[02:24:21.980 --> 02:24:22.640]
I went out of town.

[02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:24.480]
Did you get the seat on TV at all?

[02:24:25.020 --> 02:24:25.900]
They're not on TV.

[02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:26.660]
No.

[02:24:26.900 --> 02:24:28.220]
I was curious how Sean Berks planned.

[02:24:29.140 --> 02:24:30.380]
Yeah, let me say this to you.

[02:24:30.500 --> 02:24:31.260]
With all due respect.

[02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:34.480]
How guys play any guys play in the exhibition game?

[02:24:34.700 --> 02:24:36.380]
Means absolutely nothing.

[02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:38.980]
Yeah, they're trying to pedal us a big song in a dance.

[02:24:39.100 --> 02:24:42.800]
You do realize now that Kevin Weeks has gone up to play in the Canada,

[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:45.520]
the Canadian national team, because they haven't been able to sign them.

[02:24:45.540 --> 02:24:47.120]
And as Agent wants ridiculous amounts of money.

[02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:51.100]
So really what they're stuck with now, they got Sean Berk and Kirk McLean.

[02:24:51.180 --> 02:24:52.720]
Berk and Jerk is what they got in gold.

[02:24:52.900 --> 02:24:53.900]
And I'm going to tell you something.

[02:24:53.900 --> 02:24:54.860]
We got real problems.

[02:24:55.220 --> 02:24:56.480]
We're going to be letting a lot of puck.

[02:24:56.820 --> 02:24:57.240]
That's right.

[02:24:57.920 --> 02:24:58.420]
Thank you.

[02:24:58.640 --> 02:24:59.520]
Okay, good luck to us.

[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:03.280]
I mean, I realized that they would like to have made some other deal.

[02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:04.280]
They thought they had Richter.

[02:25:04.340 --> 02:25:05.520]
They thought they had Poppant.

[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:08.640]
They thought they thought V and you always think something and jump in the

[02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:09.660]
Come Shop and don't happen.

[02:25:10.860 --> 02:25:13.320]
And they're going to make you a big song in the dance about Sean Berk.

[02:25:13.380 --> 02:25:15.700]
And yeah, he's one of those guys who for a couple of games here,

[02:25:15.820 --> 02:25:18.160]
a couple of games there, very impressive and give you the idea that hey,

[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:21.880]
this guy's really something as opposed to Kirk McLean who once in a while might

[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:23.440]
play a really good game, but not very often.

[02:25:23.740 --> 02:25:24.500]
And that's what they got.

[02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:26.720]
And they kept telling us they were going to approve the gold tending,

[02:25:26.860 --> 02:25:28.260]
to which we say, yeah, right.

[02:25:30.580 --> 02:25:32.080]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:32.680]
Hello.

[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:34.360]
No, yes, sir.

[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:37.720]
Hey, I knew you were used to Republican.

[02:25:38.020 --> 02:25:39.540]
You know what I'm voting Democrat this year.

[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:39.900]
Great.

[02:25:42.020 --> 02:25:42.460]
Okay.

[02:25:43.300 --> 02:25:46.520]
Congratulations, amigo.

[02:25:46.940 --> 02:25:48.020]
And we're tracing the call.

[02:25:48.020 --> 02:25:48.920]
They'll be coming after you.

[02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:52.840]
We have an old effect that lady, that Christian lady because Christian Republican

[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:54.120]
is synonymous now in America.

[02:25:54.420 --> 02:25:57.060]
She'll be coming after you, sir, and showing you what's for.

[02:25:57.100 --> 02:25:58.240]
She'll get your ass off the year.

[02:25:58.240 --> 02:25:58.240]

[02:25:59.020 --> 02:26:00.360]
5 6 7 0 5.

[02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:00.820]
That's right.

[02:26:00.820 --> 02:26:03.400]
You'll get his show off the guy damn air before she gets ours off.

[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:06.380]
5 6 7 0 5 6 the in pound 5 60.

[02:26:06.660 --> 02:26:07.880]
They Christian moral majority.

[02:26:08.220 --> 02:26:09.400]
Good old Christians, baby.

[02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:10.560]
Christian bigot.

[02:26:10.580 --> 02:26:11.500]
Is that what you're saying, lady?

[02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:15.660]
Good old bigot and Christian because as soon as they start talking Christian,

[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:16.980]
you know what they're talking about.

[02:26:17.100 --> 02:26:17.280]
Hate.

[02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:18.480]
That's right.

[02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:19.340]
We hate this one.

[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:20.280]
We hate that one.

[02:26:20.340 --> 02:26:21.280]
We don't like what you say.

[02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:22.760]
Therefore, we're going to censor.

[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:24.780]
We're going to get you off because we can't handle the truth.

[02:26:26.260 --> 02:26:30.140]
Because we should be the only ones to propagandize in Philly, a public with all our bull crap.

[02:26:31.180 --> 02:26:32.120]
Nice going, sweetheart.

[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:32.580]
Crap.

[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:35.280]
And by the way, don't get sore about it.

[02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:36.180]
Crack go, no they're either.

[02:26:36.980 --> 02:26:37.320]
20.
