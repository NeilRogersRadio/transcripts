[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060]
The WQIS.

[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.060]
Diet drug helps obese study finds.

[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.940]
You know my doctor gave me a prescription for Maria.

[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.520]
Give her a Maria.

[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.820]
Give me a prescription for it, which I didn't feel

[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.580]
because he also gave me the literature, which I took

[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.480]
on red and said anybody.

[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.860]
Here's like 700 different categories of people who

[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.080]
should not take this diet drug.

[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.920]
And one of them was anybody who's ever

[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.120]
had a stroke or a TIA, which is like a mini stroke.

[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.600]
And I thought, well, maybe not, because it does make

[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.200]
your blood pressure go up a little bit, a little bit.

[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.280]
Two points.

[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.660]
But at any rate, it says here in this story today,

[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.920]
more than 90% of seriously obese patients lost at least

[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.320]
5% of their body weight while taking the diet drug,

[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.680]
Maria in the first six months of an ongoing European

[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.600]
study, and 54% lost at least 10% of their body weight.

[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.520]
Well, 10% of your body weight, if you weigh like 200 pounds,

[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.540]
that's 20 pounds in six months.

[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.560]
I mean, that's not bad.

[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.500]
But is that great?

[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.420]
Is that worth like jeopardizing your health

[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.460]
and your heart like all those people that were taking a

[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.180]
fend fan, which was the big thing there for all, man,

[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.000]
everybody there brother was on at fend fan.

[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.460]
There were like veterinarians were peddling a fend

[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.040]
fan to people, anybody who was like any kind of a doctor

[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.460]
was peddling fend fan right in prescription.

[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.000]
And then all of a sudden, oh, guess what?

[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.500]
People are dying like flies and their heart valves are

[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.760]
going and all kinds of other stuff.

[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.980]
And people are like winging out from fend fan.

[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.340]
So, you know, if this were something to like in about two

[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.020]
weeks, you could lose about 40 pounds.

[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.980]
That sounds real good to me, but I wouldn't have out

[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.580]
pale pass.

[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.940]
OK.

[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.780]
In fact, anybody else want this prescription from Eddie?

[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.700]
I'll sell it to you.

[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.560]
Hey, listen, you got to raise some money somehow.

[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.240]
The Dow down 87 points already in so I 10 15, which means it's

[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.000]
come down about 220 points.

[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.880]
And so it was up 135, about the nine and 25 minutes.

[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.800]
Absolutely unbelievable.

[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.360]
And you people are worried about it out there to people with no

[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.860]
money at all.

[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.200]
There's a good lesson for all you young people out there.

[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.420]
This stock market man is the biggest scam.

[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.760]
And all these people that they got on here on TV, these

[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.400]
talking heads, but I mean, but they're just a bunch of

[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.840]
shifters.

[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.780]
They haven't got any idea.

[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.380]
They don't know your ass from their elbow.

[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.800]
That's what that's all about.

[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.780]
I mean, they're very entertaining on CNBC.

[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.300]
I have a lot of respect for these people.

[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.700]
They work 12, 15 hours a day.

[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.240]
I never see anything like it in my life, but they have got no

[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.000]
clue in all these experts that they bring on have got less

[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.580]
of a clue.

[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.020]
And then what's that?

[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.460]
What's that broad and Cohen shorts Johnson?

[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.880]
Whatever her name is from Goldman Sachs that they keep

[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.780]
quoting every day, huh?

[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.420]
I wrote it down and Abby.

[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.460]
Abby Abby Johnson Cohen, something like that.

[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.460]
Abby Schwartz, Weinstein Cohen.

[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.000]
That's her name.

[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.280]
Yeah, she's hot going to China.

[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.620]
Oh, yeah, we still see 9,300, 10,000 by the end of the year,

[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.800]
but I mean, but I'm seeing stars in my eyes.

[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.540]
Okay, Abby, you phony bitch.

[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.060]
NFL, the police and the police, they've concluded their

[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.300]
investigation into a top of stance to a sexual assault

[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.120]
accusation against Dallas Cowboys line in Larry Allen on Monday

[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.500]
without filing any charges.

[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.840]
We are suspending our investigation, Dallas police sergeant

[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.920]
Jim Chandler said we're not filing charges against him or

[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.340]
the one more not going to make a grand jury referral, but he

[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.740]
stressed that while the investigation has concluded, Allen

[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.920]
has not been entirely cleared, which whatever that, what does

[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.240]
that mean?

[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.360]
What does that mean?

[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.460]
It is not likely that it'll be reopened, but we are

[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.100]
preserving that as a possibility in the future Chandler said.

[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.380]
The woman said last week that Alan Forthorne had sex at

[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.080]
night point August 24th in the parking lot of Kings,

[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.880]
Cabaret Club.

[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.340]
And of course, Gary Jones said, but I don't know, but like he

[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.760]
always says, and how much of a check do I have to write to

[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.360]
what in this one?

[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.740]
And that just continues on and on with all your great heroes

[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.180]
out there.

[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.740]
Big non story again in our face.

[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.500]
He wanted a problem.

[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.220]
We got is that like in this town, nothing is happening.

[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.980]
So people keep writing stories in the papers, especially this

[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.780]
sports pages, a non story.

[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.860]
This one even says it's an on story by Michael Russo in a

[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.560]
son central this morning on potpan panthers deal, no news and

[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.360]
none knows.

[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.740]
Right.

[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.800]
Same old crap.

[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.580]
They just, you know, different pictures, different song and

[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.820]
a dance.

[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.940]
Now they got to check out need him.

[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.020]
I see if he's really a pussy.

[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.200]
If his health is okay, if he's going to be able to play, I'm

[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.140]
going to tell you if the Leafs are willing to take Rob

[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.440]
need him.

[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.940]
Are they sure they need brain surgery up there in Toronto?

[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.160]
They need mental health.

[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.180]
We've known that for a long time.

[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.180]
The ghost of Harold Ballard must be making a comeback.

[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.040]
So there's another non story and of course the sale of the

[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.740]
panther, the Marlins, which was imminent like almost any single

[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.440]
day Don Smiley, John Henry.

[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.300]
What was that?

[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.040]
Guadalajal Kuvas?

[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.260]
Is anything happening with that yet?

[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.640]
No, so just continues dragon and dragon and dragon and dragon

[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.720]
and nothing's going on here except we do have Mark McGuary

[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.060]
and a tremendous home ones in vading practice.

[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.560]
It's great.

[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.500]
He's brought a lot of excitement.

[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.440]
But like I said, to me, he's a boring guy.

[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.000]
Oh, but he's hitting those tape measure.

[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.700]
You know something he's still boring.

[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.340]
And if I had to choose, I mean like I hope they both had like

[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.460]
65 would be great.

[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.520]
It's great for the game.

[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.560]
We need something to be excited about because of the

[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.200]
down 114 and then I was down 16.

[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.880]
And it could be another gigantic horrendous day.

[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.460]
We could have a worldwide depression.

[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.280]
So let's at least watch the ball games.

[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.540]

[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.500]
Those guys are only making $7, $10 a year.

[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.760]
I have to worry about.

[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.700]
Here's Miramar.

[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.060]
Hello.

[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.540]
Hey, I'm the new.

[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.900]
How you doing?

[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.700]
I'm doing okay.

[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.640]
Hey, I wrote.

[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.920]
You know, I didn't get to call yesterday, but I couldn't hold.

[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.480]
I had taken out the car.

[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.160]
I wanted to call him.

[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.680]
Thank you for right.

[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.080]
Stewart tickets and it upended my wife.

[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.140]
And I went to a car game.

[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.840]
Good for you.

[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:27.160]
Yeah.

[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.520]
She enjoyed it.

[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.760]
Yeah.

[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.660]
Who'd you go with your boyfriend?

[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.640]
I'm her girlfriend.

[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.740]
Yeah.

[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.280]
Like we story.

[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.880]
Um, we believe it.

[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.360]
And and McGuire story until until he's finally doing something,

[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.220]
uh, doing some drugs or whatever that's making him hit at 95 mile an hour

[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.080]
fast ball or 80 mile an hour curve or a change.

[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.400]
Up.

[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.820]
Get as big as he wants.

[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.040]
I can take care of us.

[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.400]
Yeah.

[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.100]
That's all.

[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.000]
Oh, no, that drug thing.

[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.600]
I mean, nobody's even talking about that anymore.

[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.820]
I know, but although this one guy, the NFL suspended Paul Wiggins for four games for

[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.760]
taking that Andrew, uh, because he bought it at a health food store in Eugene, Oregon,

[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.140]
didn't realize it was banned by the NFL.

[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.760]
Yeah.

[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.260]
Which I don't understand why it is banned by the NFL, because it's still it's just a food supplement.

[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.020]
I'm also a player.

[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.920]
I don't know the rules anyway.

[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.300]
Yeah.

[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.200]
That's all.

[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.580]
Okay.

[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.080]
Thank you, sir.

[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.920]
And have a great life.

[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.520]
And I'm glad your wife enjoyed it anyway.

[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.680]
Okay.

[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.700]
We have two open lines in the Broward one and date five six seven oh five 60 pound five

[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.300]
60 on the, whatever it is, mobile one line anybody else out there who couldn't care less

[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.140]
about the Marlins or about baseball in general.

[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.580]
Are they whipped up into a frenzy?

[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.520]
Are they showing some interest because of this thing with a home run chase?

[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.700]
I think it's great.

[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.560]
It's something in an otherwise boring terminal.

[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.500]
One of the worst summers in the history of anybody's life in recent memory.

[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.960]
It's at least something.

[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.540]
And let me tell you one other thing.

[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.500]
While I'm at it while my armors fall off my head.

[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.380]
Since we were talking about the sports bar with a microphone, you sports gamblers

[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.800]
out there.

[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.340]
You know something far be it for me.

[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.000]
If that's how you want to spend your money, probably more fun and investigate in the

[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.260]
market.

[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.160]
It's probably a lot more profitable these days too.

[00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:03.180]
But it is the, it's the death knell of this station and any sports talk radio station sports.

[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.120]
And then you know something I hear almost none of it anywhere else.

[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.500]
But you sports gamblers out there.

[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.980]
As soon as I hear somebody call any show in a, how do you like in that?

[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.100]
Though do you like in the kickoff?

[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.980]
I said, click.

[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.600]
I mean, I'm going to tell you either the button goes to another station in the off

[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.560]
position or to the CD goes popping in there immediately.

[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.640]
It is terminal.

[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.840]
That would be like my bringing in the program from Pompato Park Thursday morning and

[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.680]
going down every race here and reading a, you know, who won the race?

[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.340]
What did it pay?

[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.780]
What was the time of what did I have?

[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.840]
Terminally boring you sports gamblers out there.

[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.780]
In fact, maybe what maybe we ought to start doing some giveaways to GA.

[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.160]
That would be a tremendous service of your sports station WQM to send a lot of

[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.600]
you people to GA because number one, it might help you with your gambling problem.

[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.040]
And number two, it might get you your calls off the year.

[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.280]
Terminal.

[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.880]
Oh, here's Greg Reed got Georgia's bonus here today.

[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.640]
Does he have it today?

[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.800]
Well, why, you know, I don't understand this.

[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.260]
Why is this man laughing?

[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.280]
Have you ever seen that thing?

[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.320]
Why is this man laughing?

[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.100]
Why is this man laughing?

[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.540]
Unless he's just hosting you.

[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:05.880]
Okay.

[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.300]
I mean, he's been hosting people ever since long before I knew him.

[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.540]
I'm sure that's the story I hear.

[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.060]
But why unless it's a whole job, what is he laughing about?

[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.460]
If it were serious matter, he'd say, Oh, gee, I'm taking care of that.

[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.880]
And of course you'd say, Oh, yeah, sure.

[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.040]
Likely story.

[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:22.460]
I will.

[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.080]
I give it right.

[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:23.520]
Exactly.

[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.780]
That's what he's thinking right now.

[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.740]
We don't have you to see you didn't get that in writing unless you get everything

[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.920]
in writing with these people.

[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.020]
They won't do it for love or an especially for money.

[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.760]
Forget about the love park because there is no love.

[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.680]
No chance.

[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.820]
That's the beastly way, baby.

[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.740]
That's what it's all about.

[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.600]
And so they do the tat dance, but I beat, but I will.

[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.340]
132 at 560 WQA.

[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.800]
So anyway, we had a one share at 1030 last night.

[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.600]
How come we had a zero share at 930?

[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.860]
Because everybody was watching a Marlon game in Mark McGuire.

[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.620]
Did you notice last night, by the way, if you were there or you watched the game,

[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.020]
well, if you were there, you were one of those leaving after his last at bat in the

[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.140]
top of the ninth inning and struck out again.

[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.940]
Mark McGuire, you know, isn't going to be up again because obviously the

[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.380]
Marlins are going to be making a comeback.

[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.880]
Plus it's late 10 o'clock at night.

[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.820]
Everybody got to go home, sleep in this town.

[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.400]
So everybody and their brother is pouring out of there at that point.

[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:13.900]
It was great.

[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.560]
What you'd expect that I'm not blaming anybody for doing that because they didn't

[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.360]
go there to see the game.

[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.400]
They went there to see Big Mac.

[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.680]
That's what they went there to see.

[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.760]
And as soon as his last at bat is over, he gets called out on strike.

[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.340]
See, they're all gone.

[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:25.940]
Unbelievable.

[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.100]
We have an open line in day two and Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60,

[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.020]
on the mobile one line, Hank will be with you live from the sporting

[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.080]
bruise at two o'clock.

[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.360]
And then we got Donnie B Donnie B is going to do condom talk at six o'clock tonight.

[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.920]
We have what that tape by the way over at station.

[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:42.580]
Do we have that?

[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:42.880]
Yes.

[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:43.880]
Can we hear it?

[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.020]
Joe.

[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.140]
Oh, we'd love to hear that.

[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:50.780]
If you do and direct me, it definitely been, you know, teaming up a very nice one,

[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.700]
two power condom.

[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:53.940]
It's really work.

[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.980]
I want to power kind of anybody got a power condom.

[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.440]
Apparently, yes, he wanted to he didn't know whether to say combo or tandem.

[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.720]
And yeah, combo and tandem.

[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.700]
You put them together and you got a big fat condom there, baby.

[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.780]
Here's Miami.

[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.140]
Hello.

[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:12.960]
Okay.

[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.280]
Well, this is going to be just like yesterday all over again.

[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.980]
In other words, the cats got their tongue again today.

[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.880]
I thought we got that out of our system yesterday.

[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.600]
Two open lines in day two and Broward.

[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.500]
We got big Mac going on here in town.

[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.540]
We got all the excitement that anybody could want.

[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.020]
And then some and I asked him, I guess they're answering my question.

[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.240]
Do we care about this?

[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.820]
No, anybody that's not like a baseball or a sports fan,

[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.880]
and never cared about it before.

[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.340]
Do they care?

[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:33.580]
No.

[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.040]
Okay.

[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:34.820]
Thanks for the answer.

[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.100]
And two open lines in Broward, five six, seven, oh five, 60 and five,

[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.580]
60 on the mobile one line.

[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.080]
Beautiful.

[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.740]
Anybody care about the market?

[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.080]
It's up 40 54 points now, by the way, the Dow,

[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.940]
Nasdaq's making a little comeback.

[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:47.700]
It's up and down.

[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.400]
It's all over the place.

[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.520]
It's enough to give you a St.

[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.200]
Vider stance and green apple quick step.

[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.240]
Do they care about that?

[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:52.580]
No.

[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.460]
Here's a mobile in Cooper City.

[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:55.740]
Hello.

[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.100]
Morning, Neil.

[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:57.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.320]
I don't have.

[00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:58.760]
Okay.

[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.560]
I went to the game last night only because Mac was there.

[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:01.760]
Right.

[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:02.920]
Because we're free.

[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.220]
That's because we're free for any other team I wouldn't have went anyways.

[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.660]
But I see them left a couple out of the sky.

[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.940]
Don't know, I got back from cars up there for three weeks.

[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.520]
And I was reading the sun every day there.

[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.100]
And that's what the deal was that their time of pop band for me to my almost

[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:19.400]
cute.

[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.280]
I can't believe the least with you.

[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:21.440]
Yeah.

[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:21.700]
Okay.

[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.760]
Well listen, have a great day, pal.

[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.340]
Okay.

[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.560]
We got one call on the board again.

[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.380]
Here I thought that yesterday was going to be the day just like the market.

[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.480]
I thought we get out of our system like a regurgitation and these people got

[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.680]
nothing to say about any of this.

[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.100]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line.

[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.020]
Maybe it's not only all my cash that's floating before my eyes.

[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.660]
Maybe it's my whole livelihood to the same thing because this town just

[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.180]
right up like a gigantic prune.

[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.100]
Here's our last call today.

[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:47.480]
Miami.

[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:47.820]
Hello.

[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.040]
Hey, Neil.

[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:49.580]
Yes, sir.

[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.900]
First of all, it's my birthday.

[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:51.600]
Okay.

[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.000]
Great.

[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.900]
Finally old enough to be president.

[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:54.660]
Yeah.

[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.600]
Neil, the reason I'm calling, it's kind of an old fire report, I guess.

[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.060]
I don't know.

[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.600]
But this is the thing.

[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.540]
I'm not a pervert or anything, but I collect old playboys.

[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.200]
Yeah.

[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:13.800]
And I'm reading a playboy from 1975 and it has the pig skin preview.

[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.480]
I don't know whatever that I don't know with the college players.

[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.380]
They're picked.

[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.260]
So who's the best college players or whatever.

[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.980]
And there is a guy in there named Kim.

[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.620]
Ro camp with an R.

[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.360]
Yeah, from Michigan state.

[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.740]
I know I'm not a joxton.

[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:35.400]
I know you're not the sports guy or anything, but is this the same Kim

[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.660]
Bo camp to change his name?

[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.940]
Is this could be the same guy?

[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.900]
It's a totally different guy.

[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.180]
Yes.

[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.000]
Was that guy?

[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.020]
So in other words, this guy, Ro camp just happens that he's from the same era

[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.140]
and such a similar name.

[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.680]
Meaning what?

[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:49.860]
No, I'm just curious.

[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.260]
I just think it's quite a coincidence.

[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.840]
In other words, you find that they're like three or four letters that are

[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.640]
different than missing and that therefore it's close enough and it's a match.

[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.320]
Well, there's two letters that are different at the same first name.

[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.620]
No, Kim, let me say it again.

[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:01.880]
No.

[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:02.840]
Okay.

[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.540]
Well, Neil have a great day.

[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.960]
Okay, we have two open lines and they in all of Broward five six seven,

[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.340]
oh, five, this is on, but this is just like a whole new episode in my life.

[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.400]
Here just one you expect that you have some idea what's going on.

[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.300]
Like I've told you for 22 and a half years, all of a sudden these,

[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.480]
they're all in the form of their brokers.

[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.300]
That must be it.

[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.140]
The thousand eighty seven and eighty six.

[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:23.960]
Excuse me.

[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.840]
It's up and down.

[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.260]
It's all over the guy that's up and done more than Kathy Willards.

[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.540]
And this audience, man, they're down.

[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.240]
They're on the outs.

[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]
They got nothing to say.

[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.900]
We got all this big excitement going on in town.

[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.500]
Finally, something going on here today.

[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.960]
Anything to say on the show about it?

[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.160]
No, they call in the prime.

[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.800]
Listen to Hank yesterday driving home.

[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.500]
He's talking about McGuire about so so about this and about that.

[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.540]
First guy, damn call.

[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.720]
Hey, could you like in the kickoff classic tonight?

[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.520]
Oh my God.

[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.920]
I just wanted to kill myself.

[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.660]
Just wanted to kick.

[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.320]
Oh, you think the dolphins could cover the three and a half on Sunday?

[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.160]
I mean, professional gamblers.

[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.180]
That's always God, man.

[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:55.920]
It's all we got left.

[00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:58.920]
Terrifying.

[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.060]
Here's Miami.

[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:01.420]
Hello.

[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:02.500]
Hello.

[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:03.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.260]
Yeah, I think you reached your last night.

[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.520]
I asked the year game.

[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.900]
I got to tell you something and you were funny looking.

[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.400]
You look like a pimple on my butt.

[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.020]
Oh, great.

[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.620]
Thank you.

[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.920]
You must have a lot of them evidently.

[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.160]
I'd like to see a pimple on your butt.

[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:16.420]
Okay.

[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.320]
Send us a picture, pal.

[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:18.960]
Okay.

[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.920]
We got two open lines and Broward all of a day.

[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.100]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line.

[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.440]
Excellent start to the week.

[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.620]
22 B4 11 at 5 60 QA.

[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.360]
If you look at 60 QA.

[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:31.840]
A new.

[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.140]
Fuck you.

[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.140]
There are companies boring.

[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:34.780]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.080]
It's 16 B4 11 at 5 60 WQM.

[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.020]
We have powered 5 6 7 0 5 60.

[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.180]
0 5 60 on a mobile one line.

[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.220]
Here's a lady on a pay phone in Miami.

[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:43.560]
Hello.

[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:44.960]
Is she going?

[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.380]
Well, thank you so much for waiting.

[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.560]
Maybe her quarters ran out.

[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.440]
Don't start that again.

[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.260]
Here's a mobile in Miami likes.

[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:51.560]
Hello.

[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:52.820]
How's it going, Neil?

[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.320]
Okay, sir.

[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.220]
Yeah, I heard that little oracle like punk say something

[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.780]
that actually made sense this morning.

[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.120]
Yeah.

[00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.620]
He said that.

[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.660]
This is having a great home run here,

[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.580]
but McGuire is a great home on hitter.

[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.760]
It deserves all the attention.

[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.560]
It shouldn't be focused on sir.

[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.120]
No, that doesn't make any sense at all.

[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.660]
No, it does not.

[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.260]
This is getting lucky and having a house.

[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.680]
No, so says not getting lucky.

[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.140]
So says a lot younger than McGuire number one.

[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.060]
Do you think it runs to the air last year?

[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.760]
What does that got to do with it?

[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.060]
Well, he's having a lucky year.

[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:20.620]
Let me ask you that.

[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.300]
How many is he going to hit next year?

[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.220]
Maybe he's going to hit 78 next year.

[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.000]
How the hell do you know?

[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.060]
Yeah, but how many years does McGuire hit 50?

[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.760]
This will be the third.

[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.000]
Exactly in a row.

[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:30.640]
Yeah.

[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.080]
So I wouldn't call that luck.

[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.560]
Did I call it luck?

[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:34.060]
What is?

[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.440]
Sir, what are you talking about?

[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.480]
Are you lost it?

[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.440]
Did you lose all your money in a market overnight?

[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.500]
No, not all.

[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.440]
You probably don't have any.

[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:41.640]
What an idiot.

[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.760]
I never said McGuire was lucky.

[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.160]
I said he hit 58 last year.

[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.100]
And that's why everybody expects him to be the one to do it.

[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.000]
Because he's the home run hitter.

[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.480]
But so says a better ball player.

[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.080]
He's exciting.

[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.680]
Can Griffey Jr.'s exciting.

[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.720]
Juan Gonzalez is exciting at seven RBI's last night.

[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.520]
He's got 143 guy named RBI's with him up to go.

[00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.580]
Those are exciting ball players, OK?

[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.220]
And like I said, I hope they both do it.

[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.220]
But please don't try to tell me that McGuire deserves

[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.840]
more publicity than Sammy Sosa.

[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.900]
But anyway, yeah, that's right.

[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.540]
You and Geldie, maybe you can alloke, pal.

[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.700]
I wish you're all the best in the world.

[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.000]
Two open lines in date, five six seven,

[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.820]
five 60, pound five 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.060]
Here's Weston.

[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:21.300]
Hello.

[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.200]
Weston.

[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:24.840]
Oh, hello.

[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.380]
Hi, sir.

[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.240]
First of all, I agree with you on Sammy Sosa.

[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.380]
He's twice more exciting than Mark McWire.

[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.080]
He's a great athlete.

[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.160]
He's having exciting ball players, exciting to watch.

[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:34.760]
Right.

[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.460]
And secondly, I'm going to say that I'm going to say that

[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.700]
did you watch your 930 show last night?

[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.280]
No, I did not.

[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.720]
I was watching the baseball game like everybody else.

[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.020]
Well, I watched believe it or not,

[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.100]
I watched the show last night.

[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.340]
The 930 show must be the one because we had a big 930.

[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.380]
And Jeff Cohen came and delivered.

[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.080]
Boy, I did see that part.

[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.740]
Yeah, 30 twinnings that flipped over and I saw Jeff Cohen's

[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:54.680]
back blocking the camera.

[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.700]
And I saw the very end of it when I threw all the crap

[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.420]
in a waist basket.

[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.440]
That was great.

[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.040]
Thank God they put that in there.

[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:00.720]
Nice going guys.

[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.360]
That was great.

[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.820]
And one other thing are on the Ben and Jerry's fish food ice cream.

[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:08.920]
I wanted to ask you, did you ever try a dastardly match?

[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.780]
No, it's a, uh,

[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:12.320]
I'm in search.

[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.320]
Please, with all due respect, I don't want to hear about

[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.480]
any new ice cream flavors.

[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.280]
I don't want George ordering me secret meals like he did here yesterday.

[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.420]
I was so, I was so psychotic when I left here yesterday,

[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.960]
I wanted to kill somebody.

[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.540]
Any hell in closing, could I call somebody to do

[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:25.800]
a bag?

[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.120]
Go ahead.

[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.720]
Markets for me, these ice cream.

[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:28.520]
You're right.

[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:28.680]
You're right.

[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.360]
You're right about that.

[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:30.780]
Anyway, I leave here yesterday.

[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.260]
First of all, I go down to my car.

[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.540]
I had my oil change.

[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.700]
Did my red vet yesterday.

[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.100]
Okay.

[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.760]
Now, last time I had the oil change in my red vet,

[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.480]
remember what happened?

[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.600]
I'm driving home and I all these high inflation lights come

[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.200]
onto my computer and a car because they'd overinflated the tires.

[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.700]
And I go home and check and 47 pounds in the tires.

[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.120]
And I said, you're, I'm not going to mention who changed the oil.

[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.680]
Okay, don't want to mention any names.

[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.780]
I said to George yesterday when he called for me.

[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.900]
I told him to ask if they could change you.

[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.080]
30 pounds in the tires.

[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.460]
That's what it says in the manual.

[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.760]
That's the correct pressure for those tires.

[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.220]
Okay.

[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.300]
30 pounds.

[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.560]
I know I've got two of them.

[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.100]
Believe me, that's the right pressure.

[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.160]
Guy brings me back the car yesterday.

[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.520]
I pay him and we're going out to the car.

[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.200]
First of all, fat boy Jeff High is out there with the car.

[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.460]
I was already ready to kill somebody.

[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.420]
In fact, there's something I blew it.

[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.680]
That's why I should have nailed right there.

[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:21.440]
Jeff High.

[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.420]
Hey, Pally.

[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.060]
You know, anybody that says Pally, you know, is a real major asshole.

[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:26.420]
Okay.

[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:27.740]
Hey, Pally.

[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.400]
It's like people that say things out of a comic book.

[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.540]
Like like boohoo.

[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.540]
Did you ever hear anybody say boohoo?

[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.280]
No, people don't say boohoo is something out of a comic strip.

[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.560]
Just like people don't say, hey, Pally.

[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.020]
So Jeff High is out there.

[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.600]
So we must be looking for a goddamn job or something again.

[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.300]
Although I don't want the people back in Clearchan,

[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.720]
we'll find out he was over here sucking around for work evidently.

[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:55.160]
So then the guy from the place tells me, oh, we put 40 pounds in the tires

[00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:00.180]
because the sidewall says maximum in pressure PSI-44.

[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.580]
And at that point, I wanted to sit down on the curb out there

[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:05.780]
and just start crying.

[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.260]
I said, but George Polagai,

[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.360]
when before they picked up the car, 30 pounds,

[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.200]
well, we go by the, what it says on the,

[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.360]
we go by what it says on the tire,

[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.700]
even though the customer says this is right and the manual says this is right.

[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.520]
And so, you know, he said, okay,

[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.620]
if you want to stop by in a way,

[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.820]
home will us rate it out for you.

[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.360]
So first of all, I was too pissed off.

[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.300]
Number one is stop by.

[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.160]
And number two, I figured, okay, me because he's telling me,

[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.040]
well, you know, a lot of people like, like it this way,

[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.880]
like you've got a choice, like it makes no difference what it says in the manual.

[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.480]
If you want to stick 40 pounds of pressure in there, go right ahead.

[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.200]
Like all the punks with their big oversized tires, you know,

[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.460]
like I'm going to be 10 years old again.

[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.660]
So I'm driving home about third away up the turn.

[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.540]
Picking, guess what?

[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.680]
Here comes the computer.

[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.280]
High, high inflation front left.

[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.620]
High inflation front right.

[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.820]
They're like being able to move out all of it to God in place.

[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.860]
So I had to go home and dittle around and get the pressure out of there

[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.160]
and get it back to 30 where it belonged.

[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.320]
So other than that,

[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.120]
why can't it came out people communicate in this town?

[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.020]
Can't you speak?

[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.800]
They speak perfect English in that joint.

[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.420]
30 pounds of pressure.

[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.060]
In fact, if you do me a favor, just change the oil

[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.980]
and do whatever goes along with it and check the, you know, the fluid that this,

[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:14.800]
that's all.

[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.340]
Thank you.

[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.180]
Leave my F entire is alone.

[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:17.760]
Please.

[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.760]
Please, those tires only cost like four, five hundred bucks a pop.

[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:22.820]
Just leave them alone.

[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.700]
Please, I'll take care of the pressure.

[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.480]
I check it like all the time constantly.

[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.360]
And there's like an automatic pressure thing on it.

[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.120]
Anyway, on the computer that tells you how much pressure is in the tire.

[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:36.260]
So please, no more 50 pounds, no more truck tires and more court, my Corvette, please.

[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.100]
So where do you think I'm going to do oil change next time, George?

[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.300]
Okay, here's a, oh, she's back.

[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.220]
The lady in the people and I'm hot going to try to kill.

[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:44.620]

[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.680]
Hi, good morning, Neil.

[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.160]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.460]
I'm just going to let you know that the white tire listening.

[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.040]
I'm from Michigan, but now you're 10 years.

[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.540]
And I'm a loyal listener.

[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.840]
You know, I love your show.

[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.980]
I'm smiling here to hear these people think I must complain with my self in the car here.

[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.900]
I love your show.

[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:57.840]
Keep up the good deal.

[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:58.680]
Thank you so much.

[00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:58.900]
Take care.

[00:20:59.160 --> 00:20:59.840]
Okay, see you.

[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.200]
Bye-bye.

[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:00.980]
Well, that was nice.

[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.240]
You actually spent a couple of quarters.

[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.400]
Well, she won't need them later.

[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.920]
We have an open line and dating to a brown word five six seven oh five sixty

[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.040]
pound five sixty on the mobile one line.

[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:11.920]
Here's Kendall.

[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.280]
Hello.

[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:13.900]
Morning, Neil.

[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:14.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.040]
Listen, I hear WQAM made a bid to buy Russian.

[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.380]
I'm promised to pay by check.

[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.980]
Yeltsin says, uh, I can buy Russia right now.

[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.180]
I can cover it with my own check.

[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.860]
Show me the money.

[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.200]
Yeah.

[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.460]
Anyway, uh, you hear like yesterday Bill Gates lost four billion dollars.

[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.140]
And you know, like something I'm really crying for.

[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.340]
I'm really upset about that.

[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.640]
It's not something you know, he can lose all his money.

[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.500]
And he still has like 50 billion left.

[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.140]
Yeah, just breaks my heart.

[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.180]
May we have to translate our money into like sense.

[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.440]
Like, you know, I lost a hundred thousand pennies or something.

[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.340]
That's a feeling important.

[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.940]
You know, let me say it again.

[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.640]
If I could tell you how much I've lost on paper in the last six weeks,

[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.320]
we booked a lot in the street and blow some of these brains out.

[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.920]
I know I just called my, uh, what, uh, FBR, whatever it is called,

[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.600]
the trip savings plan for every time.

[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:03.940]
Yeah.

[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.080]
And, uh, the last figures they have are of July 31st.

[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:13.300]
So they want, uh, you know, give them no figures until September 11th or so.

[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:13.740]
Mm-hmm.

[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.560]
Yeah, I really don't know what the hell.

[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.500]
You know, how much money I got left there, but, you know,

[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.320]
I don't want to get out now.

[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.320]
I don't want to go out there and get a lot of ammunition and canned goods.

[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.540]
I don't want to get out now because, uh, you know,

[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.260]
my retirement is like eight years away.

[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.160]
Don't worry about it.

[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.280]
I figured I can hold on.

[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.700]
Just like Monica says, what goes up must come down or the other way around.

[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.420]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.680]
Good luck to us all.

[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.500]
Like Connie Tim said, two open lines and date and two and brown.

[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.220]
And five six seven, oh five sixty,

[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.700]
pump five sixty on the mobile one line.

[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.620]
That was up 51, that's next down three.

[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.400]
It's just hovering.

[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.920]
Now is not the time to even really pay any attention.

[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.980]
The time to pay attention is like after about two or 30.

[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.700]
In fact, I think they wait till I get home.

[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.220]
Yeah, they have like a spy in my corner.

[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.200]
Oh, he's home now.

[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:55.500]
Okay.

[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.640]
Now let's go eight shot.

[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.000]
Okay.

[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.400]
Because that's what they did yesterday.

[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.740]
I'm sitting there really easily drinking my diet.

[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.220]
So to look at the TV screen, try to digest that meal that I didn't want.

[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.860]
And all of a sudden, it's down to 40 and it's down to 16.

[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.400]
That's dropping 300 and three.

[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.700]
And I'm just sitting there like frozen in suspended animation.

[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.160]
Like what the hell are you going to do?

[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.700]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.060]
Hello.

[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:19.780]
Hello.

[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:20.440]
Yes, sir.

[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.000]
Yeah.

[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:21.440]
Yes.

[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.540]
I hope that guy and the lake's family lakes are still listening.

[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.620]
Either either real moron.

[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:26.980]
Yeah.

[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.200]
Sami, that year, uh, break time out 40.

[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:36.100]
I'm Ron and he had a, uh, he's almost broken, but the body had him in a pitch.

[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:36.520]
Right.

[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.460]
So he really doesn't know what he's talking about.

[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.500]
The guy out 40 home and last year.

[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.860]
And family sources younger than Mark McGuery, he made me,

[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.060]
maybe come on of the most prodigious home run hitters.

[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.480]
Who now knows what differences are made common to you?

[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.640]
Somebody hit last year.

[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:49.940]
Exactly.

[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:55.640]
But by the way, he got 40 anyhow and and and the reason that that's like saying,

[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.800]
well, you know, Roger Maris had 61 to one time,

[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.080]
but you'll never hit more than 39 a day other season.

[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.620]
Well, what the hell difference does it make?

[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.300]
Does that diminish the record many other way?

[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.980]
And the reason he didn't go over 50 is because his arm was broken.

[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.320]
Yeah.

[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.460]
By the way, Neil, I know you go to you a lot.

[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.280]
I just came back from Bobo Beach and the men's Republic.

[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.780]
I met somebody from Italy there.

[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:18.320]
The other film is the plays that they call each care and the capri.

[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.880]
Yes, you're the you scare.

[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:21.340]
Yeah.

[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.420]
Do those are carbilla?

[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.060]
You ever been there?

[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:23.540]
No.

[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.300]
I'm going to use your right now as a matter of fact.

[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.020]
I'm going to say, uh,

[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.880]
cottage or something for my bank account.

[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:30.820]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.220]
Thank you.

[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:31.760]
I'm even urging.

[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.420]
Okay, we got one call on the board.

[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.400]
This is this is not shocking.

[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.620]
This is typical two open lines and they all are powered right open.

[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.160]
Okay, if you don't care about Mark McGuery,

[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.140]
you don't care about the guy damn stock market.

[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.440]
You don't care about any other guy damn thing that's going on.

[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.740]
If you're is anybody in this audience taking meridia?

[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:47.860]
No.

[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.080]
Can they tell us anything about that?

[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:49.380]
No.

[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.500]
Well, what is with these people?

[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.900]
What do they know besides what do you got for free?

[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.220]
5 6 7 0 5.

[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.440]
You know something what I'm going to do?

[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.040]
I'm just I'm not going to fight it.

[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.160]
Today is the day, baby.

[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.300]
I'm just going to clean out those accounts.

[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.200]
Whatever I got left.

[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.500]
I'm going to hop out of plane.

[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:08.880]
The nice zone.

[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.060]
What happened about?

[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.240]
I mean, this is a radio show that a guy sits here and

[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.440]
it throws out 50 billion, 200 thousand things.

[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.040]
And these goddamn people sit there like that.

[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.300]
This is Miami.

[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.260]
This is South Florida.

[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.620]
If you're visiting here, by the way,

[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:25.700]
have one question for you.

[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:26.080]
Why?

[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.900]
What in God's name?

[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.680]
What could you have possibly been thinking about to come here?

[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.700]
This is the end of the goddamn universe here.

[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.840]
Open line into it.

[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.460]
Too and brown.

[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.180]
I'm not going to move.

[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.660]
I'm not going to do a goddamn thing

[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.060]
until we start motivating these goddamn assholes out there.

[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:42.260]
Okay.

[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.480]
The sky's not falling.

[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.620]
That was up 80 points.

[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:45.760]
Joe Kernan sitting there looking.

[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.340]
He's amusing.

[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.300]
I like Joe Kernan.

[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.020]
He's a funny guy.

[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.180]
He don't always ask for him as elbow anymore than the rest of them.

[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.020]
But at least he's entertaining.

[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:51.760]
He's entertaining.

[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:52.900]
That's all we can get.

[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:53.920]
Expect his entertainment.

[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.360]
So what the hell if the world is going into hell in a hand basket

[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.940]
and Bubba's over there talking to the guy

[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.080]
dim Russian college students that are sitting there?

[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:01.920]
What's he saying?

[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.540]
Are those the guys?

[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.000]
They don't know what they're least talking about.

[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.220]
Which I guess makes two of them.

[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.220]
Here's a mobile in the Gables.

[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:08.520]
Hello.

[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.640]
Hello, Neil.

[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:10.160]
Yes, sir.

[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.400]
I'm Don Carrano.

[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.580]
I'm going to get on a bad stuff.

[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.880]
I want to thank you.

[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.780]
My seniors are going around the Akin's diet.

[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.120]
Yeah.

[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.280]
Even though you know you're not on a solid weight.

[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:18.980]
Yeah, you did.

[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.200]
But you can be inspiration.

[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.800]
I lost 40 pounds in a few years and I kept it off.

[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.440]
Oh, thank God that I stay.

[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.000]
See how many lives I stay out there?

[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.240]
I'm three on fish with dough.

[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:27.680]
Huh?

[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.680]
I can't do no fish.

[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.380]
That's all right.

[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.140]
I haven't eaten anything anymore though.

[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.100]
I'm taking good care of the losing him no time.

[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.740]
This is all I want to talk about walking around.

[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:36.120]
Yeah.

[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.280]
I'm also the reason people I talk about Mark McWire

[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.480]
is that after he did have a good season.

[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.660]
But Sammy also was injured

[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.540]
part of the season after the game.

[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:46.240]
That's what the guy just said, right?

[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.300]
But Sammy also is a winning one.

[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.800]
Sighting players like Ken Griffey is a win more exciting

[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.900]
to fit the player in.

[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.820]
I just think that's a 10 Griffey.

[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.960]
Even though he's only got 48 instead of 55.

[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.480]
But it's 10 times more exciting player than Mark McWire.

[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.320]
That's what Mark McWire has a big lot with huge arms.

[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.160]
He can just hit it.

[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.540]
It's just like a toothpick in his hands.

[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:11.140]
Right.

[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:11.580]
Right.

[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.560]
Well, they got a take-off with that guy who turned him

[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.780]
on the steroids and felt things.

[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.260]
There he goes.

[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.140]
Now we got to the bottom of that's right.

[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.660]
Host, they know where they're good crashers.

[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.000]
Okay, go find a good sell pal.

[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.360]
Another great day.

[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.200]
He's got a bad sell.

[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:26.920]
Anybody out there in a bad sell?

[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.180]
We have an open line in day two and brown.

[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:33.120]
We got the deadest guy they have audience in the history

[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.220]
of mankind on this show.

[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.620]
Dead or an adorned ale.

[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.820]
And that was up 79 and Aztec's back in a plus.

[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.540]
It's up five points.

[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.280]
What do you want from me?

[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.580]
Okay, I'm pushing for it.

[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.000]
I'm pulling.

[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:42.600]
I'm squeezing.

[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.180]
I'm doing everything in my power.

[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.200]
I got people in the other room

[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.980]
that buying stock like crazy with bad checks from unsigned checks.

[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.280]
Unsigned checks from whammy

[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.300]
and bad checks from Beasley Reed.

[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:53.740]
Okay.

[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.100]
But at least it looks good on the other thing up there anyway.

[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.140]
It's all psychological.

[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.720]
See, it's all in your mind.

[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.080]
Like yesterday, we're seeing at the an oiler's panic down here.

[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.920]
Of course, there's panic for Christ's sake.

[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.460]
People are peeing in their pantaloonies.

[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.380]
I mean, it's money.

[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.020]
It's all we got.

[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.540]
We should have been sticking it out of the mattress.

[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.660]
We should have stuck in the guy dead banks somewhere.

[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.840]
And they've been cutting us into this gambling game.

[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.960]
And let me tell you again,

[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.180]
chronic gambling is for maniacs, for losers.

[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.220]
I'm so sick and tired of hearing all these gamblers

[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.800]
talking to me and trying to go how they won this and they had a good

[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.560]
like I told you before,

[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.960]
chronic compulsive sick gamblers will never tell you about their losing.

[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.540]
Only about their winnings.

[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.500]
And believe you, me, almost every single one of them

[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.520]
with very few exceptions in the long run lose their ass.

[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.020]
Okay, I feel better now.

[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.060]
1057 at 560 QA.

[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.320]
I'm a huge fan.

[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.700]
You were talking about one of your dollars.

[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:45.280]
Yeah.

[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:46.580]
Is he crazy or what?

[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.440]
Is he sensational?

[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.720]
And talk about a guy that gets no publicity.

[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:50.860]
I'm not on.

[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.380]
Zipity doodah zero.

[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.860]
If you went out on the street in this town and asked people

[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.040]
who one gun dollars was,

[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.360]
they'd cut these some idiot that lives in Halea.

[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.080]
The most phenomenal player there is.

[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.360]
I'm telling you, I want to say that.

[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:01.700]
Number one.

[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.040]
He's great.

[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.080]
He's 50 with a 75 last night.

[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:06.640]
Yes.

[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.000]
Seven of you have two doubles.

[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:08.960]
Just go to one room.

[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.380]
One more.

[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:09.740]
You want.

[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.420]
Maybe a couple more.

[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.380]
Well, you know, no more guards.

[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.700]
You're close to when you're talking about.

[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.180]
Forget that.

[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:15.940]
Forget them.

[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.180]
And listen, I don't want to talk about all these marginal people.

[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:18.520]
Okay.

[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.260]
If you're talking.

[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.500]
No more great.

[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.840]
Like I said, marginal.

[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:23.520]
Okay.

[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.220]
Call the sports you.

[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:24.780]
It's good out of here.

[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.240]
I'm not doing a sports you.

[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:27.780]
I'm talking about a phenomenon that's

[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.100]
become a part of American culture,

[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.660]
which George is very upset about by the way.

[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.060]
Too bad.

[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:31.620]
Let's see.

[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.280]
Let's hear your good topics for today, George.

[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:34.360]
For today?

[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:34.780]
Yeah.

[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.200]
I think what you're talking about off the air

[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.640]
was way better than the.

[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:38.140]
And about what?

[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:38.760]
He thought so.

[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.060]
This town and how they're more.

[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:41.640]
I bet.

[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.020]
But I've already said that a million times.

[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:44.340]
Okay.

[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.260]
There's no point in repeating the obvious.

[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.060]
There's no point making these people suffer

[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.840]
anymore than they have to because we all

[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.580]
happen to be here.

[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:51.900]
They know it.

[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.660]
We have an open line.

[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.420]
How many people do you think are really here

[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:55.900]
voluntarily?

[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:57.200]
Six?

[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.120]
In other words, if they had an option, if all of a sudden

[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.140]
they opened up their bank account tomorrow morning

[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.560]
and was like $10 million in cash,

[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:04.440]
somebody stuck in here.

[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.140]
The money fairy stuck in there.

[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.960]
How many people do you think would stick around?

[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.640]
Five, four, any hands?

[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.040]
Anybody stick around here?

[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:14.920]
I don't see any hands in this style.

[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:15.920]
How about I have the other one?

[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.700]
Many hands going up?

[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:18.320]
Huh?

[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.360]
One.

[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:21.940]
Who is it?

[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:24.640]
Who was it?

[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:25.640]
Oh, Ron.

[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:25.760]

[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.220]
Yeah, well, Ron, he's got problems.

[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.520]
Okay, we have an open line.

[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.520]
It's five, six, seven, oh, five, six.

[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.300]
Yeah, he's not standing here.

[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.040]
He had the money boy.

[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:33.520]
He disappeared.

[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.720]
They wouldn't fight about it at all.

[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.080]
He'd be the first one gone.

[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:37.560]
Here's my main story.

[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:37.900]
Hello?

[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:39.560]
Yeah.

[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.820]
Yes, sir?

[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:47.800]
The West today has proven that a nuclear bomb is the town.

[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.220]
Yes?

[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:49.980]
Recall, rare.

[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.780]
How the dolphins going to win the Super Bowl?

[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:52.940]
Right.

[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.500]
The first call of the...

[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.160]
What do you think of the kickoff plan?

[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:56.940]
It's a good idea, huh?

[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:57.720]
I mean, it's seriously.

[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.220]
When I heard that yesterday, I was so deep-spirited.

[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.440]
I mean, I don't know if it was so close.

[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.040]
What's going on in this town?

[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.680]
Is there any hockey going on now?

[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.080]
The NBA is the ring now, Ron.

[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:07.420]
Right.

[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:08.720]
Is there anything going on?

[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.000]
I mean, the dolphins haven't played one-wheel game yet.

[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.140]
The one thing going on is over at the stadium.

[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.540]
We've got 36,000 people in there for me in this game.

[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:20.380]
And here's some asshole calling up wanting to know who does somebody like, in other words,

[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.480]
who they should bet on in a goddamn ballgame.

[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.440]
The one horse pound, I'm going to say I've been hit by...

[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.280]
God, it's unbelievable.

[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.980]
The one horse pound, and it always will be.

[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.540]
Where's the market goes?

[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:31.820]
Friday, I got a call.

[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.180]
But this is what they're doing now.

[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.980]
Friday, I got a call for a potential base.

[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:35.500]
Yeah.

[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.860]
Basically, the woman said, did you see what the market's doing?

[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.120]
I said, I just got off the internet.

[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.520]
I'm sweating like a pig with corn.

[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.120]
I just got to lose the money.

[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:43.720]
You know?

[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.200]
He goes, how can a child think about, well, you know, you should put your money to this?

[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.040]
Say I said, how did you get my number?

[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:54.520]
He goes, well, I got you off a list of perceptive assholes.

[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:55.700]
Right.

[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.600]
So I said, yeah, I'm out.

[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.420]
Oh, a list of potential suicides, right?

[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.440]
I got a couple of nickels like, you know, a few other people.

[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.200]
And the bottom line is losing that, you know, a few thousand, so forth.

[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.640]
And all the experts say, the course, they even went to...

[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.440]
Now you can't sell.

[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.540]
Now you can't get out because they didn't want.

[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.180]
That's right.

[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.440]
So the bottom line is enclosing my drive cleaners instead of best.

[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.120]
Sometimes you get advice from the strangers people.

[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.460]
He said, the market's not for small people like us.

[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.380]
The big people manipulated the make money, they lose money.

[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.900]
But the small guys that you and me get hurt.

[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:29.600]
I think he's right.

[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.900]
Five to six years ago, the seniors put your money in PDs, your major six percent.

[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:34.460]
You were happy.

[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:34.760]
Yeah.

[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.320]
You didn't sweat like a pig.

[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:37.900]
And the market, what did you do now?

[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.340]
It's up 87.

[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.460]
And the next step on this 12th.

[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.520]
Oh, thank God.

[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.560]
The COVID keeps going.

[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:43.960]
Okay.

[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.100]
Good luck, Mr. Zagizun.

[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:45.860]
Okay.

[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:46.320]
There's a guy.

[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.320]
Thank God I finally heard from somebody else because misery loves company.

[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.540]
And I know nobody gives a crap because I'm making a few bucks.

[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.580]
I'm not going to starve to death.

[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.060]
But it's retirement money.

[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.220]
It's money you save for years and years and years with one thing in mind.

[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.580]
Like, finally, finally I can stop.

[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.280]
Every day of my life coming in and begging people to talk to me.

[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.240]
That's what I get paid to do.

[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.580]
I don't get paid to come in and entertain or talk to people.

[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:09.900]
I come in to get paid.

[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:10.780]
I get paid.

[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.420]
The big people to speak about anything they want.

[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.000]
That's Miami for ya baby.

[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.000]
The dead is God damn placed on the face of their head.

[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:23.640]
And I don't even blame these people to be honest with you because is there anything going on here and out?

[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.340]
Mark McGuire coming to town.

[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.540]
Is the most important exciting.

[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.060]
There's a God damn election today.

[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.700]
Does anybody including me care about it?

[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:29.900]
No.

[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.800]
No, because we're just we're just totally turned off to that crap.

[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.620]
We got the best crooked politicians that money can buy in his town.

[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.960]
Nobody with a brain gives a crap.

[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.380]
there are going to be five percent of the people who are going to vote.

[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.460]
Oh, that's why you're not getting a lot of votes.

[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.060]
All voting.

[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.040]
All out voting.

[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:45.880]
Yeah, right.

[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.540]
Give me a fricking break.

[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.880]
Man, oh man, or shepherds.

[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.920]
And what did I say years ago?

[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.800]
40 years ago, I said, you know, this place is just a fraction of what it could be.

[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:04.240]
And then they finally, they put a bunch of pink and lemon and lime buildings down there

[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:08.200]
in South Beach and got a bunch of drug addicts and fags down there.

[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.160]
And they really, and a few people, you know, big name people, Madonna hangs out in this

[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:12.500]
one of them.

[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.160]
And they really think that they put us on a mat.

[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.080]
They think that they've made this into like a tropical paradise.

[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:21.880]
Here's the Miami.

[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.220]
Hello.

[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:23.340]
Hello?

[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:23.940]
Yes, sir.

[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.220]
I got a thing for free today.

[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:26.820]
Yeah.

[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:27.900]
Dial tone.

[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:34.900]
We have an open line in day, welcome, customer pennies, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 5, 60 on the 18T wireless

[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:35.240]
line.

[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:36.300]
Asshole.

[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.640]
It's 11, 08 at 5, 60 QA.

[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.320]
And if you need to have done that, one good thing.

[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.180]
See, this is still for lining in every casket.

[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.800]
It's 11, 13 at 5, 60 WQA.

[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.240]
And don't forget, Hank's going to be live at the sporting brews today from 2 to 6.

[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.280]
Anything you get out of that red and festive joint.

[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:55.600]
And then we got Donny B. Donny B for another penetrating interview tonight from 6 to 6,

[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:56.700]
30 before the free game show.

[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.720]
I'm going to tell you who's doing a hell of a good job, by the way, since I get accused

[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:00.380]
of knocking everybody.

[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.640]
And that's Blue Shombie.

[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.900]
Now when it comes to doing a talk show, no, that's not his deal, OK?

[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:08.860]
And then Gorsi got settled with Christina Moore, not his deal.

[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:13.380]
But as far as the pregame show and the interviews and his play by play and the still car, Blue

[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:17.840]
Shombie is great, which I was never all I keen on because my first exposure with him,

[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.540]
if you've heard that expression, was with Christina Moore on a talk show, not a talk

[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.040]
show guy.

[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.680]
But great on the ball games and the stuff that he's doing.

[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.500]
Nice going folks to even when he orange here.

[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.480]
So see when somebody does a good job, I'll be the first one to come on and fed you.

[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.900]
And if somebody don't belong on here like Geldie, I'll be the first one to turn in the

[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.640]
second one and third one and over and over again.

[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:36.620]
Can you know what I mean?

[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.300]
That's right.

[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.080]
And what is that call in Florence, Oregon?

[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:39.980]
Can that be for real?

[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:40.260]
Hello?

[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.520]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:42.780]
How you doing?

[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:43.540]
You're in Florence?

[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:44.760]
Florence, Oregon.

[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.760]
Oh my God.

[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.200]
Yeah, I got the hell out of my Amy a couple years ago.

[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:48.580]
Yeah?

[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.040]
Congratulations, sir.

[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.700]
I have no idea about Florence, Oregon, but it's got to be a big improvement.

[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.620]
Come on out and visit.

[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.120]
We need a guy like you out here.

[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:55.800]
Yeah, I'll tell you.

[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:56.340]
Yeah.

[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:02.240]
Just want to say, love looks at your show, especially 3000 miles away.

[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:02.540]
Right.

[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.540]
Thank God for that internet, right?

[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:05.300]
That's right.

[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.160]
It works well for me.

[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:07.820]
Okay, pal.

[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.360]
Well, listen, have a touch with you and Miami.

[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.080]
Have a great life.

[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:10.620]
You too.

[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.580]
And believe me, you're out of be 10 times as happy.

[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:13.020]
You left here.

[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:13.860]
It's a lot worse now.

[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.040]
Oh, I know it is.

[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.420]
My mother still lives down there.

[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:16.780]
Okay.

[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.420]
Get her out of there.

[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.020]
Good luck, pal.

[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:18.760]
Take care, sir.

[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.040]
Okay, we have two open lines in Dadees from Florence, Oregon.

[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:22.920]
I feel like that.

[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.880]
They like to show up there in Oregon, the people on the internet who are listening around

[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.700]
the country, the people who live here, they're not too crazy about me because they know

[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.740]
me better than the people in Oregon.

[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:34.180]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:39.480]
Yeah, we saw you all in, by the way, that's that looney tune, Schmoth, that's got to

[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:39.640]
go.

[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.760]
You see that last night on the 1030 show?

[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.260]
It looked like I had, I don't know what that looked like.

[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.020]
I had underwear on my head or something.

[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:47.820]
It's pretty big, yeah.

[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:49.220]
Yeah.

[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.440]
Well, I got news, I'll give it to Joe Rose and my cover, his head.

[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.540]
Let's go to a mobile in Fort Lauderdale, hello.

[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.220]
Hello, me, all right.

[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:00.540]
Who gets your promos?

[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.000]
I'm looking all over for Ed Kaplan, I can't find them.

[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:03.760]
Yeah.

[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.200]
Well, they got a change in that and they look to get them as you say, Ponder.

[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.080]
Why, what did it say?

[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.200]
Where do you find Ed Kaplan?

[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.240]
Where do you find Angolberg?

[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.300]
Where do you find Ed Kaplan?

[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.180]
You find him at the track.

[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.080]
Exactly.

[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.660]
Where do you find Angolberg at the track?

[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.520]
At the end of the middle of your show, where do you find your lodgers?

[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.880]
Yeah, you're right, pretty weak.

[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:21.740]
Really weak.

[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.140]
Wouldn't it be nice if they told you what time?

[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.220]
Now you're getting, you know, picky with the Bluff Lindsay who you're, like he'd even

[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.780]
be able to find his way to work every day.

[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:30.760]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:31.520]
I'm on a material.

[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.300]
Okay, thank you.

[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:36.720]
Okay, two open lines and day one and Broward, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.800]
Yeah, you, I hate Cliff, you and that Mark Katsa, you become quite a one-two condom.

[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.960]
That was, it was the epitome of WQM.

[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.820]
If I, you know, I'm embarrassed to say that to you, but hey, I had no shame.

[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:49.720]
I mean, I'm working here.

[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.820]
That's the epitome of this station.

[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.600]
Little kids on here, it's like tryouts for little kids.

[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.760]
And Donnie, you know, he's trying like crazy and he's, you know, someday maybe he'll be

[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.120]
on here, maybe not, maybe he'll wise up and get a real job where he gets paid.

[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:08.580]
But a one-two condom, I mean, what are we talking about here, boys and girls?

[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.420]
And that's our idea of, you know, penetrating, exciting, a radio here.

[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.720]
Just get the spots on.

[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.060]
Stop belly it can already.

[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.720]
Nobody wants to hear about it.

[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:19.420]
It's too hot.

[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.700]
The markets in the crapper.

[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.220]
Nobody wants to hear about this.

[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.220]
Just bring the spots on, please.

[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.600]
Here's Miami.

[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:26.920]
Hello?

[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.320]
How about the rocket, man?

[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.480]
He's doing it in Toronto.

[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:37.440]
He's, I believe, it's kind of three, three shout outs and, you know, he's got like 17

[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:37.780]
wins.

[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:38.280]
Yeah.

[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.440]
Probably on his way, another one.

[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.180]
Great.

[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:40.520]
Okay.

[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.740]
Thank you and get a new phone.

[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:43.100]
Okay.

[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.160]
We have, we're not talking baseball here today.

[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.480]
We're talking about the phenomenon of the Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa.

[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.600]
I'm not turning this into a sports joke and I'll care about the rocket.

[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.620]
School the rocket.

[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:53.680]
How about rocket, Richard?

[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:54.360]
How's he doing?

[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:55.680]
How about the pocket rocket?

[00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:01.700]
Dave County's wide open, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 18t wireless line.

[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.720]
Hey, what do you think about the kickoff classic?

[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:04.900]
How about those seminars?

[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:05.920]
Oh, God.

[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.700]
And he knows something.

[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.600]
That's a real sickness here in Florida.

[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:16.840]
More so than any other state in the world is college football is like a mental illness

[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:17.480]
in this state.

[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:21.780]
It's either hercune, gators, seminald and it's like you have to be obsessed with that

[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.040]
for like six months out of the year.

[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.180]
Do I give a crap about any of it?

[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:26.480]
No.

[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.900]
Not in the least, but in fact, hey, I was hoping that the Texas A&M and I don't even know

[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.200]
who to hold anything about Texas A&M.

[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.680]
I watched about five minutes of that game last night.

[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:38.280]
I thought this would really piss Bobby about when he were down 14 to 10 there in the third

[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:38.560]
quarter.

[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.840]
I'm thinking to myself, well, would this serve that Bobby bound right for preempting

[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.940]
our show on Sunday night on a whammy?

[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.780]
I mean, what is that all about?

[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:51.540]
Colleges that have to have winning football teams and they got the best program.

[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.480]
What does that mean?

[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]
You know what it means?

[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.840]
That's all it means is rhymes with mean green.

[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:57.680]
That's what it means.

[00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:58.620]
All about big money.

[00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.660]
It's got nothing to do with anything.

[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.580]
Does it mean anybody learned anything there?

[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:01.920]
No.

[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:02.220]
No.

[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.300]
Does it mean it's a great institution of a...

[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:04.460]
No.

[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:04.460]

[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:11.000]
Dave County 56670560.560 on the AT&P line.

[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:12.100]
Here's Margate.

[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:12.360]
Hello.

[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.120]
Hello?

[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:14.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.900]
Yeah, I'm calling for Margate.

[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.980]
I'm just going to call and play a re-enjoy your show and I do watch the show on whammy

[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:21.460]
every night.

[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.240]
I'm one of those rare people that you don't think that watches it, but I do.

[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.240]
I just want to call off the subject of sports.

[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.180]
Talk about top-fired.

[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.840]
I'm pretty discussed with it, too.

[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.060]
In particular, the school system.

[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:38.900]
My son just started kindergarten yesterday and his first day I was going to lunch.

[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.260]
They give me half an hour for lunch.

[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.640]
The kids got his lunch.

[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.120]
By the time he got off the line, it's the down easy.

[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.120]
I have a minute to eat.

[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.000]
I got one bite of his sandwich and had to go back to class.

[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.580]
In the school, they're only supposed to have 800 kids.

[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:57.640]
They now have over 1200 kids registered for it.

[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.460]
I've seen on the promo that Buddy McKay is trying to work for governor, saying that he's

[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:09.220]
going to clean up the lottery scam that caused the problem with the school and education,

[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.180]
but isn't he the person that's in office right now that this whole scam has gone through

[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.140]
all this time and his men's childhood has done nothing for it?

[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.200]
I just want to know your thoughts about the whole thing.

[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:23.300]
I think they're both paying you a lot of lip service and as long as the old parts

[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.420]
have the power like in Broward County, nothing's going to really happen.

[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.460]
That's another thing.

[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.720]
That's the one thing I'm crazy.

[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.940]
The old parts are selfish and obnoxious.

[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.080]
They don't want to pay one dime to educate anybody else's kids, including yours.

[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.040]
And that's why it's a very low priority.

[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.120]
And, but I mean, because the demographics in this town are all screwed up, and especially

[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:40.680]
in Broward.

[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.140]
Broward is, you know, something I would say to somebody yesterday, driving around.

[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.920]
Broward County is getting younger to me.

[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.160]
I don't care what they tell us with the Census Bureau.

[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:50.920]
Broward County is so old.

[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.520]
The average age there must be like death less one day.

[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:54.800]
I mean, it's unbelievable.

[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.560]
So what's the answer to that?

[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.260]
I mean, Jeff Bush, I don't think there's the answer either.

[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.540]
What's the, there's politically there is no answer.

[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.140]
The answer is, you know, if you're going to afford a private school, that's the answer

[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.420]
and it's not the do the best you can.

[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.040]
Yeah.

[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.200]
Okay, thanks.

[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:07.740]
Good luck, pal.

[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:08.120]
Okay.

[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.220]
We have two open line.

[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.040]
Hey, but we got good football programs there.

[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:12.660]
Miami high.

[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.300]
There you go.

[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.440]
We got good athletic programs.

[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.640]
Two open lines and date one in Broward.

[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:21.920]
Five six seven, oh five sixty, five sixty on the AT&T line.

[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.360]
The dollars of 129 points.

[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.040]
And that's up 28 points.

[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.700]
But don't get too excited.

[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.160]
It's only 11 20 in the morning.

[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.920]
At least it's not crashing to the damn floor again like it looked like it might be again

[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.340]
this morning.

[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:34.880]
It's up.

[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:35.340]
It's down.

[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:39.320]
It's a volatile is the word you're looking for because everybody is psychotic and hysterical

[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.100]
and the people who don't have money, they're laughing up their sleeve now.

[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.180]
Here's a lady in Pompano.

[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:44.480]
Hello.

[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:45.880]
Hi, now.

[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:46.500]
Yes, man.

[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.340]
I agree with this about everything you say except when it comes to the market.

[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.920]
What does that mean?

[00:42:53.340 --> 00:43:00.220]
Well, I feel that you you you fan the flames of irrationality of the individual investor.

[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.460]
I fan the flames of rationality.

[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.000]
I've got some.

[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:04.440]
I've got some.

[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:08.340]
I've got something to do with that.

[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.400]
Yeah, with people getting you know, except and crazy because it's up to.

[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:15.900]
When you're in the market, you better be honest with the long haul.

[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.460]
You got to watch what's going on.

[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.440]
Number one, ask yourself questions.

[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:23.260]
What is fundamentally wrong with the economy of the United States?

[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:24.340]
Nothing.

[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.480]
Are our unemployment as well?

[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:29.760]
Yeah.

[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.240]
Are unemployment as though we have no.

[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.480]
In other words, you're saying that what's happening, the fact that markets all over the

[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.020]
rest of the world are crumbling has no impact on us whatsoever.

[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.020]
How about our exports?

[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:41.780]
How do we export?

[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.720]
How does Russia, how does Russia's market affect us?

[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.660]
I'm talking about Russia.

[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:46.540]
I'm talking about Japan.

[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.720]
I'm talking about Hong Kong.

[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.040]
I'm talking about Latin America.

[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.300]
I'm talking about every other stock market in the world, Australia, New Zealand.

[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.440]
I watch these things.

[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:56.640]
We know I hate to break the news, but being a massacre is like I am.

[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.300]
I watch these things very carefully.

[00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.640]
I watch Bloomberg TV.

[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.540]
I watch CNBC.

[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:01.980]
I watch all of this crap.

[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.780]
And I'm telling you every other market in the world is taking a giant.

[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.240]
Europe is in the crapper.

[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:08.720]
We can't vacuum.

[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:12.780]
The market economy is going to operate in a vacuum.

[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.280]
The people are out there.

[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:21.880]
And as corporate profits go down and as customers are confident, people spend less money and

[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:24.880]
as corporate profits go down, well, we got real problems, don't we?

[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:25.380]
Right.

[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.620]
And therefore, the value of the stock goes down.

[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.500]
People panic and start selling it.

[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:34.540]
They want to put their money in safe havens like bonds and in even money market funds.

[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.700]
It's the return is very low.

[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.020]
It's the lowest yield in 77%.

[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:42.520]
I understand that, but I'm just telling you what people are doing and they're not doing it because

[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:43.940]
the O'Rodgers is on a radio stage.

[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.120]
I'm just reading the numbers off the screen here.

[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:50.120]
I'm reading the same numbers that anybody with a TV set can watch anywhere in the world.

[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.640]
It bows up 120 points.

[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.000]
When it goes up, I tell you when it goes down, I'm telling you.

[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:58.380]
In addition to which mostly damage yesterday happened long after I was out of the year.

[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.760]
Start watching trends as opposed to the daily up in the Amazon.

[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:03.140]
That's not what it's all about.

[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.520]
Well, the trend is that since July 17th, the market's lost 1800 points.

[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.560]
Does that look like a trend to you?

[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.460]
Okay, but think about how fast it went up and why it went up.

[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.660]
Didn't go up 1800 points in six weeks.

[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.740]
No, we're talking over month.

[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:18.660]
Right.

[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:25.280]
And why it went up is what Alan Greenspan called irrational exuberance is that all these thoughts were over price?

[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.200]
Exactly. There was no value, no price or increase.

[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.860]
So, what are you talking about?

[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.000]
I can talk about this and don't.

[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.040]
There goes up and down, nothing down and nothing down.

[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.520]
I'm not talking about the people that start freaking out.

[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:38.820]
And that's the problem that's freaking out.

[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:43.580]
I've had a lot of ridiculous calls in the 22 and a half years I've been on the year in Miami.

[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:45.280]
But this is, you're in the running.

[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.760]
I'm not going to say on top of the list, but you're certainly in the top 10.

[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.540]
Like, I'm somehow responsible for people panicking.

[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:52.940]

[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.080]
No, no, no.

[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:55.920]
Then what are you saying?

[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.460]
What did you just get through saying?

[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.140]
Don't do this. Don't go up and down.

[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.560]
I'll go up and down all I want.

[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.080]
Get out of here.

[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.740]
Crazy person. Probably a stock broker.

[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.680]
Sounds maybe like my stock broker.

[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.040]
Who knows nothing, by the way.

[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.780]
Absolutely nothing, which I won't mention your name on the year.

[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.500]
We have two open lines and day one and Broward five six.

[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.860]
If he just said, does anybody know?

[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.580]
No. Except that I'm responsible.

[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.640]
See, as soon as she started opening up her big mouth, we're up 100th.

[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.980]
Now it's only now it's dropping against the 98th point, instead of 120.

[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.560]
Only since she came on the year.

[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.020]
So, even though I have no idea what she said, whatever you said, sweetheart,

[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.260]
you were the kiss of death.

[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.080]
Look at that. The market is dumping right now.

[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:35.740]
Just on the heels of whatever you said.

[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.080]
That's the impact we have.

[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:41.460]
I can't even get the guy that six lines lit up here in South Florida.

[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:42.800]
I've been on the year here for 100 years.

[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.900]
I can't remember the number one rated show in town.

[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.740]
I can't get these people to call about anything for love or money.

[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:52.660]
And I've got such tremendous power that the market where markets all over the world are diving,

[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:57.900]
are crashing and somehow it's because of me because I said it's up and that's exactly what it is.

[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:01.700]
The market opened this morning and went up 136 points.

[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.560]
Then it was down 69 points.

[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:04.860]
Then it was up to 120.

[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:06.500]
Now it's dropping again.

[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.640]
It's up 97, but it's losing a lot of its gains.

[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.780]
It's up and down. It's all over the place, which you'd expect, because people are

[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:16.620]
don't know about their screen reader banana or killer broker, which sounds pretty inviting.

[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.440]
Because like somebody said a few days ago, we're not here to give advice.

[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:26.220]
We're here to sell stock and buy selling buy.

[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.240]
We're here to get commissions or sell people.

[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:29.880]
Fails people.

[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.840]
There you go. We finally got to the bottom of this whole damn thing.

[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.880]
What about the ten years on it shows you what looks amazing?

[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.240]
Fails people are ISO.

[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.380]
Exactly. Like Jeff.

[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:42.220]
How would you like to have a rough day like I did yesterday and walk out of here?

[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:46.620]
Find out that your tires have been overinflated like about the 10 pounds pressure per tire.

[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.980]
And then see Jeff high standing there.

[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:53.520]
Who is by the way much more overinflated than 10 pounds per square inch.

[00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:00.000]
Hey, pal. Oh God. I'm going to tell you my life was dancing in front of my eyes.

[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:01.200]
Was he still using a cane?

[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:04.760]
No. No, he claims he's lost some weight. I said, how can you tell?

[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:07.060]
He must have just taken a big.

[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.920]
It's 1126. How would you like to pay your bills that way at home?

[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.540]
You know, like F P N L or there's a Southern belt, anything like your utilities, your water bill.

[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.840]
You know, you'd be sitting there in a house with the dark is what it would be.

[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.800]
Well, I don't care. They can turn everything off, but I'm not ready to pay yet.

[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.740]
I got you know, $50 trillion during the bank and my stocks are doing real good.

[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:31.500]
But I'm not I'm just not ready to pay yet. It's not a question of if it's a question of when.

[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.260]
And so after the episode on the year was off, you know, behind closed doors in there.

[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:40.200]
Greg Reed tells George, oh, I'm doing everything I can and just the, you know,

[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:44.500]
the paperwork is in over there, but just a question of getting them off their ass and I'm doing all I can right now.

[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:50.060]
He's doing all he can't just like he's going to spend $15 million to invest in the God then Florida, Marlon.

[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:55.920]
Come on. What are we talking about here? Like I've said before, I got him summed up perfectly.

[00:48:56.180 --> 00:49:00.440]
He's a good guy. He's got good intentions. He knows nothing about the business, but he's a good guy.

[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:06.520]
Never stole a freight train. He'd like to take care of people, but he can't because he has nothing to say about anything.

[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.460]
He's a face man for the beastly guys.

[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:17.360]
And believe me, if you ever saw these guys, you you come running with with with the bread and water for these guys.

[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:24.840]
If you saw that, you'd say here, can you know, you know, you'd reach in your pocket, you say, I might need these quarters later on, but can you use them now?

[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:30.680]
That's what they look like. They do look like they just crawled out of a goddamn dumpster. I'm not exaggerating.

[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:37.300]
And before I came to work here, I heard, oh, they just sold that big station in LA for 120 million cash. They're loaded money.

[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.760]
If they're loaded with money, they must be rolling around it and the mud too.

[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:52.320]
Because they are unbelievable. Just like you people are unbelievable today. And yesterday we got two calls on the board, two open lines and dating two and Howard. It's a hopeless case.

[00:49:53.080 --> 00:50:02.780]
I think we've come to the end of the new Roger show as we knew it. Markets coming to an end of what's up 92. It's not doing that bad. And that's X up 25. But nevertheless, kind of a half-ash the rally here today.

[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:10.660]
They don't really have their hearts in it because they're all panicky. I think this audience is the same. There's a lot of fun for 22 and a half years, but these people got nothing to say about it.

[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:22.240]
5 6 7 0 5 60, 0 5 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line. How is it possible in the area of four million people that have to work so hard to try to squeeze a few words out of anybody? How is it possible?

[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:29.700]
Here's a mobile in Pember pine. Hello? Uncle. Yes, I'm ready to say uncle right now. I'm ready to pack it in.

[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:37.540]
Yeah, here. Let's get on a plane and head for just a take me anywhere out of here. I'd like to try and make a plea to the idiots that go to the baseball game.

[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:53.980]
Yes, stay in your seats until between innings. I have seven roast seats on the third day. Well, I last night cardinals game. If I had a dollar for every time I had to get up and sit down and get up and sit down and get up and sit down. I'd have more money than Mark McGuire has Homer.

[00:50:53.980 --> 00:51:05.260]
First of all, you got to understand that most of those people there are just front running ponies anywhere. They're there to see a phenomenon who have no idea of how to conduct themselves at a baseball game or any sporting event or any other place in public. That's what you're dealing with.

[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:15.000]
I guess so. I mean, leave your two year old at home and just go to the game with your wife or girlfriend and have a good time. That's right. Leave those pain in the ass little kids at home. Exactly.

[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:29.360]
Up and down all night. Although you don't have to understand one thing. You got to sympathize a little bit because the prices of the tickets for any sporting event or so. She can't afford a babysitter anymore. Well, that's the whole point of the kid next door. You know, get him to get in the house and want to two year old for whatever three hours.

[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:43.000]
Just deposit the two year old and dumpster on a way to the ballpark and have a good time. That's commonplace around here. I'm just this off about it because you know, of course, you know, you take good money to go to the game and every. I mean, I got to tell you no no exaggeration.

[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:55.480]
50 times I got up last night. Hey, that's one of the main reasons I stopped going to Marlon and to Dolphin games. Not just because of the fact that it was so ponderous, but it's you know, when you consider home and watch it for free in the comfort of your own house.

[00:51:55.740 --> 00:52:04.020]
And it's such an unenjoyable event between the parking. It's a schlepper to parking and and then the people behave like a bunch of assholes. How can you enjoy it?

[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:16.720]
Well, it's one thing if you're getting up and down like between the things when nothing's going on. I got a problem with that. But when there's a guy at that and you know, you got 16 people on it's the same people every half hour getting up and down. It's just a pan. Yeah. Amen.

[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:25.080]
Have a nice day. Good luck. Well, yeah, we sure got the most knowledgeable sportsman. Hey, you think that and leave on to win 30 games this year? Yeah.

[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:40.420]
What what do these people know about you know, I'm going to tell you what they know about here suffering. We know about misery and suffering because those of us who are here, we do it every minute of every single day of our lives.

[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:51.780]
And who taught us about suffering? The old people taught us about suffering. I want to congratulate all you old parts out there because your motto is misery loves company. And I think you accomplished what you set out to do years ago.

[00:52:51.780 --> 00:53:04.440]
Those of you are and a lot of those people are in the ground now, but they still are smiling. Their cadavers are got a big smile on their foot from ear to ear because they came down here to make air. All the rest of us is miserable as they work and they've succeeded.

[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:23.860]
You old parts. You old. 20. That also began with an app. 23 before noon at 560 WQA shooting a scene. Hey guys, yeah, what do you think about my breasts? You think you know, they look okay? You think my nipples need to be hard? Maybe a little ice.

[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:39.480]
Yeah, maybe about my bowl. She think my bulge is okay. Oh, yeah, forget about your ball. What do you think about my half of my half? Oh, your head looks nice. All right, it's going to be great for a scene. Oh, yeah, your nipples are wrecking now. Oh, yeah, I.

[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:53.280]
I'm so good. I forgot my lines. We have a talk. I can't stop. I just figured out during a 36 seconds of that thing runs a David McCallum as the anti crisis. He's got to be.

[00:53:54.480 --> 00:54:08.700]
I mean, David Hasselhoff. Well, they're the same guy. No, David Hasselhoff is the anti crisis. He is so annoying. David McCallum used to be on what was that show with Robert Culp? Come on real quick. Real quick. David McCallum and Robert Culp and was it ice by? That was.

[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.680]
What's the guy like him do it out there with all those young hot bodies? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know

[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:50.640]
I don't know. Okay? Female and male, too. By the way, I should ask. What's he doing out there better ask your friend, a boyfriend, David Sharvey. I won't see him no more. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes.

[00:54:51.040 --> 00:55:02.000]
Nail. You're going to cross Pandemonian, and the, uh, stock market. That's right. Just look at the power. I got man. Nail, I have a much bigger problem in the stock market I don't have any money. Yeah.

[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.020]
But I have a bigger problem when you know something pretty soon will all be in the same boat

[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:07.320]
We can all smile to each other and say hey, how's it feel?

[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:12.080]
crappy I got a huge problem big max gonna break the record yes, I do I

[00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:15.760]
Think they're both gonna break the record. I think I should be there to

[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:21.140]
Your representative of IOD to see it to be representative of one no IOD

[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:26.140]
Okay, go go ahead and call them. I'll be giving some tickets if they're still in business. Are they still on the year?

[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:29.000]
Huh? Does anybody know? No, does anybody care? No

[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.620]
We have an open line and date one and browners five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line

[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:37.040]
It's 1109 if Q a m if you feel you

[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:51.540]
He started out a regular guy who joined the directory

[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:56.760]
And made the ultimate sacrifice in bracing

[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:56.860]
See

[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:58.740]
Oh

[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:16.840]
As time went by this earthly needs compromise his choice

[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:23.420]
It found a way to get really by altering young boys

[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.620]
Father

[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:33.740]
Right

[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:41.320]
Hey, it was happy you get till he got caught by some title

[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:48.180]
Then the Vatican paid everyone off and he didn't have to go to jail

[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:49.100]
Father

[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:55.500]
Oh

[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:06.980]
They sent him to a priest retreat where they genulect and pray

[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:10.800]
If it was you or it was me

[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.300]
Guess up and throw the keys away

[00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:15.860]
Hey

[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.120]
Oh

[00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:24.540]
Altering

[00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:25.220]
Hey

[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:30.620]
Oh

[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:39.620]
It's 1114 at 560 WQM

[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:41.640]
I'm going to tell you one thing if things get really rough today

[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.920]
I'm going to read the entire weekly world news on here today

[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:48.560]
Thank God I brought these good tabloids in that's where you find out the good stuff like the weekly wheel

[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:53.220]
A weird news. See the national acquire always tells you that everything that they write as outrageous as it is

[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:57.500]
They verify and it's all for real weekly world news, you know that everything that centers a bunch of crap

[00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:01.300]
But it's a lot more entertaining like the picture of Bubba on the front cover this week

[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:06.980]
With the black eye and a scar on the nose and the front page headline Clinton was heavy makeup died injury

[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:12.360]
Did Hillary give bill a black eyes what it says? Uh-huh first lady hits president and face with a cell phone over Monica

[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.180]
Sources say

[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:18.540]
There you go she butched up big time from the Janet Reno school of beating the crap out of you

[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:21.100]
Oh, that's a lovely picture to you know something. I saw him

[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:26.700]
He was making that most recent speech whichever one it was one of his last two 300 speeches. He made and he's he does

[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.200]
He's got makeup on it and the i2

[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:31.560]
Here's the lady in Miami. Hello

[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:36.520]
Yes, ma'am. Hi, I just want to let you in a little secret when women get together

[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:40.740]
They're worse than men they talk about yeast infections and then comes out of here and welcome better there

[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:44.360]
Maybe a little bit for rather you talk about that. Yeah, let's talk about yeast infections

[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.740]
You talk about something really disgusting. You know what my hello?

[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.720]
Climidia. Let's talk about that for hours

[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:51.640]
My boyfriend's outside painted a mailbox and I just wanted to say hello

[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:54.160]
Okay, I'm listening right now. I'm cleaning out good

[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:56.880]
And the mailbox and the box too. Okay, have a great day

[00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.440]
Clean out that box good pal

[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.460]
The mailbox too. Yeah, see she was getting close getting warm. So to speak

[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:08.080]
We have an open line. Yeah, let's talk about Climidia. How that's something Elizabeth can probably relate to

[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:14.500]
Let's talk about disgusting growing bulging yeast infections in places where it's illegal in Utah

[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.620]
Yeah, right now that see that's disgusting

[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:22.800]
That is nauseating and disgusting. I would be the first one to tell you know if I see a

[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:28.720]
But I mean like a bruised rectum recommend that's disgusting. There's nothing disgusting about that

[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:34.680]
As long as you're a sanitary person and you do those things that are required to stay sanitary

[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:37.540]
Use your tux or your uh

[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:43.560]
Charmin or whatever you I said tux or your bidet or your bidet or if you're real extra sanitary

[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:48.400]
You're your splash in that thing man. Keep it a nice and sanitary. It doesn't have to be disgusting and dirty

[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:53.060]
Although in your case Elizabeth maybe that's the problem. Maybe Elizabeth's got a very unsanitary rectum

[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:57.060]
Maybe that's the problem with air pember primes. When in doubt. Let's go make her clean it out

[00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:02.640]
I'll leave that to you. Oh here's mr. St. Louis. All of a sudden which you know he'd come out of the work day of the cop

[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.120]
Yes, how you doing Neil okay

[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.480]
Maybe she has more yeast than wholesome and I got a I got a question for you

[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:14.560]
I heard a lot of the announcers talking over the weekend about MVP for the uh for the year. Yes throwing away around a few names

[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.760]
Yes, Mark McGuire has no chance. Okay. Here's my question. Would you embrace Galaraga?

[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.280]
Would you consider it for the team or for what they've done for baseball?

[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.860]
It's never worth it. What they've done for baseball

[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:28.880]
You're reaching and stretching so hard that that's not what the MVP's all about

[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.200]
I understand. I mean so similar

[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:35.280]
I don't think it's kind of crappy team that doesn't go anywhere. It's never going to be the MVP and McGuire is not going to get it

[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.360]
I'll come to everybody's a cardinal fan now. I don't get it. They're not they're not

[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:43.340]
It's got the cardinals are a crappy team with no pitching and nobody cares about that. They're McGuire fans

[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.900]
That's all they want to see something great happen. They want them to do it

[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.720]
So do you think it's better that crappy complexion than that neck that looks like

[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.740]
He ran into a chainsaw

[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:54.600]
So you think so, it's them a choir but basically stays the state of sports this year

[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.800]
I wouldn't say they saved this for the sugar generation of interest in an otherwise lacklust a year

[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:04.740]
And the and the wild card which some assholes are opposed to by the way that also helped save this for because if weren't for the wild card

[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:09.700]
What interest would there be you got the braves and the Yankees all these other teams five million games ahead the Indian

[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:13.220]
What the hell race would there be? You're right about that. You know go to the right is playing

[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:14.160]
Graeme's in San Diego

[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.140]
Mochelle lose playing kick kick

[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:19.660]
Yes, they're more she'll lose right in there too. He's and there's not it's not a slap in the push

[01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:23.180]
You've got it. He's shot. Moichi a Lou would that be a slap in Wayne's push

[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.200]
Well, you know

[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:30.860]
Not playing in Miami. Maybe they would give it to Moichi and you notice how guys X marlins like Trevor Hoffman and Kevin Brown and Moichi a Lou

[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:35.320]
All these X marlins are having like career seasons this year not only are they having great years

[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:39.460]
But they're having career years now that they got out of here. They may have repeated this year who knows

[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.660]
But in closing just to make it short

[01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:45.520]
There's no tag in handcuffs. Okay. See. Yeah. That's for sure

[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:51.760]
We have an open line in the two of them in day five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line

[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.960]
How about it sammy so some mark McGuire let's take an office pool, huh?

[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:59.640]
Well, go they're playing pocket pool is that what they're doing right in front of mark McGuire's locker looking to see what's in there

[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.400]
I saw that guy from AP they had him on yesterday

[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:05.660]
Well, I saw the can of spinach. I thought that was cute and then I saw the

[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:12.180]
The sugarless gum next to it and at least mark McGuire ain't chewing that chewing tobacco like all these other athletes a poor role model

[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.580]
And then I just happen to see that bottle. Yeah, right

[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:17.160]
Get a bottle and drinking get out of our face

[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:23.280]
Something you buy in a guy named health food store over the counter just like all these credence taking cretin and all this stuff

[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:26.300]
And it's a supplement that you buy in a health food store

[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:32.440]
And thank God that that's pretty much washed away another they keep sitting these Titanic gigantic home runs

[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.660]
People are like forgetting all about that because they're getting wrapped up in the euphoria and let me say it again

[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.340]
Let's hear it for Fox losing all that money

[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:41.860]
A rupert Murdoch you jackass you right wing lunatic

[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.080]
Here's a western hello

[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.620]
And Neil hang in there you got about two and a half hours to go hey, I'll get there man

[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:53.640]
I've had worse experiences than this you're not on any fucking survive a blues back. Go you can survive almost anything

[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.580]
You're not on to Brian norcross. I think yet

[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:03.000]
See the problem with Brian norcross he wants. I don't want to get on that home depot stock in his 401k. Oh, no, it is

[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:08.020]
And you know if he if he threatens us with a hurricane, you know what the stock stock does now

[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:10.740]
He's just got a massive guy them ego that little Brian

[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.160]
He's like all those little people man

[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:18.540]
He's just the guy that inferiority complex and he's trying to be a big mega star now if we could just have one more big hurricane

[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:23.480]
He could double that contract didn't they change it to an anchor before he ought to be an anchor on a queen

[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.960]
Miriam believe me you can hear they would probably fly not just float it would fly

[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:35.640]
Did you see the parliament and Russia rejected uh, yes, I just got you telling that all you did and the reason being that the communist and all these other people

[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:40.180]
That are like negotiating they don't want to make an agreement right away. They want to have they they're all playing

[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:45.400]
They're negotiating listen one last time they want more to the government. They want this they want that they want their peace

[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.120]
They want some of that IMF money that everybody's split enough

[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.140]
whoever put money in Russia

[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:55.940]
Had the deserves getting their ass burnt exactly. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. See yeah

[01:03:55.940 --> 01:04:00.180]
So it'll be census I've very okay if they could afford a plane ticket to get there. Well set them on northwestern

[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:07.060]
We have two open lines and date one and brodered five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line

[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:12.680]
On an incredibly depressing day here 31st of august once we get this august out of the way then

[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.980]
It's gonna be clear sailing baby then look out for us

[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:22.160]
Once we get this damn augusto out of the way and this is the last day this awful Monday

[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.300]
By the way, I sure hope George is a good job next Monday because then he can work out just about every Monday because I think calling in sick on money

[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.260]
Sounds like a real good idea to me. Oh, yeah

[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:35.880]
There you go. You got to get a break him in slow. Okay, so start him on a day when it's a real challenge on Mondays

[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:40.380]
All the next Monday of course be a holiday nobody will be working in general those holidays are pretty good

[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.500]
Plus of course they'll all be calling into bust his balls

[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.040]
Here's Hollywood hello

[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:49.240]
Hey, you know how you doing, buddy. Okay, sir. Hey, I want to let you know that you know

[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.240]
I listen to you every day and I think you run a great show

[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.280]
You're the only person in this whole crappy station. I listen to good. I hate sports

[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:58.360]
And I mean it is atrocious, you know, I never watch sports nothing

[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:03.580]
But I think it's really sad that they're with their with their guy. He said it's sad. George is raising an eyebrow

[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:04.700]
The guy said shed

[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:11.600]
So I think it's terrible that they're trying to take all the mark McGuire has accomplished away from it

[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.500]
Just because he's take some some crappy vitamin. I was watching

[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:18.920]
I was flipping through the channels and there was a show with these four idiots on there who oh

[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.060]
He he brought up the comment and each one of these lunatics gets their turn to think about it

[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:28.740]
And he's saying oh, I think guy, you know, I'd like to see Sammy so to do it instead and this and that and I just can't believe it

[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.160]
This guy goes in the gym even told me to roost his coach

[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.020]
He said look he's in the gym working out every day. He signs on a girl for the kid

[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:38.020]
And what about that fast blob babe route this guy took all kinds of drugs and stuff

[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:43.980]
But he was drinking booze he was drinking all kinds of whiskey and beer he was a a notorious

[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.620]
Guzzler of booze and that was during prohibition

[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:50.580]
He was not only drinking all that booze, which was bad role model, but he also was breaking the law

[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:55.160]
And no one wants to go see the marlins you can offer me even take us in a dugout and I won't take them right

[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.040]
I wouldn't go to see those guys for nothing exactly

[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:01.380]
I think the more I can't stand the motor. Okay. There's a guy knows nothing about sports

[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:05.140]
Well, he said he's full of a bolt crap is what he said bull shot

[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:09.220]
We have two open lines in day one and brown at five six seven

[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:13.580]
In fact, maybe we can get leave under will open Dan La Bastard from the herald that would be a match made in heaven

[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:16.900]
And they could all they can uh get on a banana boat somewhere

[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:20.700]
However Cuban were both Cuban and they could embrace and we'll never see him again

[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:24.580]
Hey Eddie, I think leave on's gonna win a hundred games this season

[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.680]
You think the models will ever win another game Eddie. No, sorry

[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:32.160]
I'll tell you one thing they sure got a hundred losses. Looked real easy now

[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.240]
At one point there when they had those three weeks where they got hot for a little bit

[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:38.920]
It looked like just maybe they might avoid the embarrassment of losing a hundred games

[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.540]
Especially right on the hills of winning

[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:45.560]
But they already have broken the record for the worst season ever for a world championship team the following year

[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.680]
They've broken that record let's hear it

[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.620]
The amazing part I don't want to talk about it because nobody cares

[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:55.980]
But I was gonna say the amazing part of it is with all these kids they got even with the injuries

[01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:00.360]
They still score a lot of runs they got kids that are hitting the Floyd's out of control out of his mind

[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:06.420]
But they got no pitching none no matter how big the lead is is it ever big enough for them? No

[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:14.160]
25 past 11 at five Donnie B from six to six thirty and we got the orange here and won the cartoon character the booster

[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:20.600]
630 to seven to pregame show to set up the big ones out of night and the marlins and the angels with Joe and Dave seven oh five tonight

[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.240]
The

[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.580]
The marlins and what did I say the angel and the cardinals?

[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:29.220]

[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.060]

Oh god, here's a mobile in the Palm Beach. Hello

[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.060]
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir

[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:34.600]
Yes, sir. I was wondering if you heard Mr. Mendes from Saturday morning defendant Jimmy Johnson

[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.300]
No, I did not

[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:41.040]
Jason Thomas in the fourth quarter. No, I did not here. He is the starter

[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:44.880]
She personnel at defensive advantage playing in the fourth quarter

[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:49.280]
How about you till green how about the fact that he forced him to play when they were

[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.200]
He had no business using many exhibition games. How about that?

[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.980]
See Jimmy don't know make no mistakes. It's all the sports writers fault

[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:58.420]
Yes, we do have both those sports writers in this town, but Jimmy don't make mistakes

[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:03.820]
And like I said he can belly it can he can give me the beat but I'm open get all in sense to make all kinds of comments about the writers

[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:09.180]
But in the meantime now now the exhibition seasons all over with okay. That was very nice and they're looking real good

[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:15.940]
And this and that everybody's all with the ex exhibition games mean very very little in any sport and especially football

[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:22.100]
Now that the real season starts after all the hype after all the hair after all the opening of the big mouth after

[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:25.420]
It's saying he wouldn't do his coaches show on four because you don't want to do it with Joseph Gackie

[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:30.200]
Which we can understand because he wants to be under with Tony sucking his ass on channel six every week

[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.480]
Now let's see me. They're put up for shut up. Okay, Jimmy

[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:21.280]
To be entertaining amusing to hear this is the most vacuous place. What in God's name am I doing here?

[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:26.960]
What am I doing here? Why did I waste that first 35 minutes this morning spewing out all the good stuff?

[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:15.700]

[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.020]
U.A.L

[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:17.860]
When it comes to healthcare

[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:21.680]
Everybody wants to be covered but everybody thinks that somebody else is problem

[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.900]
And everybody wants it to be affordable

[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.880]
But everybody also wants the world's best health care

[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.280]
The doctors don't want to make less money the trial lawyers don't want to stop suing the doctors

[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.840]
The insurance companies don't want to pay off for lawyers

[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.640]
And the public doesn't want to pay back the insurance companies in higher premiums

[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.540]
When the doctors lose to the lawyers when maybe they shouldn't even have been sued in the first place

[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:43.620]
So where does it all end?

[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:49.500]
Well a good place to start would be by not putting mom and pop and other businesses out of business by having their employees

[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:56.340]
sued them when the insurance companies and the lawyers and the doctors and the HMOs and the politicians don't deliver health care is promised

[01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:02.980]
If you make business liable for everybody else's problems eventually the real losers will be us the patients

[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:03.940]
again

[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:09.640]

[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:18.280]
In Seattle, Washington a respected doc another respected doctor has confirmed reports that a 22 year old pregnant woman is definitely a virgin sparking rumors

[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:20.200]
That Jesus Christ is about to be reborn

[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:20.980]
All right

[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.220]
Here is a 22 year old pregnant woman who is definitely a virgin

[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:32.380]
People are working themselves at a state of hysteria over this is Dr. Charles Sontaggi the unidentified mother's position

[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:36.360]
I can assure you that other than the fact of this young woman is medically a virgin

[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:42.480]
There is nothing remarkable about her yet for weeks people have camped out in front of my orifice hoping for a glimpse of the second virgin Mary

[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:49.080]
News of the miracle pregnancy spread after doctors Sontaggi wrote an article on the case in a medical urinal and extensive

[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:53.460]
excerpt was imprinted in a widely circulated church newsletter and now thousands of the vout

[01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:59.780]
Historical crazy Christians are flocking here from around the country eager to be on hand for the birth of the new Messiah

[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:04.480]
To protect the privacy of his patients doctor. By the way, how can there be a new Messiah

[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:09.460]
Huh we're expecting one aren't we I mean you

[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:11.980]
I mean you

[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.380]
I thought he was coming back on a motorcycle

[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:20.620]
I think it was gonna be an imposter not a new one. Oh, maybe this one's a clone. Maybe it's Dali

[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:26.320]
To protect the privacy of his patients doctor Sontaggi has had to move his orifice and get an unlisted phone number

[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:31.040]
He said with a sigh it'll be a relief when this whole thing blows over as what he said

[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:36.160]
Said a local Baptist minister until a child is born. We won't know for sure

[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:41.800]
But they determined the beyond a shadow of it out. She has never had sexual intercourse. It's a freaking miracle

[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:44.160]
It's a spontaneous birth

[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:46.620]
It's a freaking virgin

[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:49.700]

Let me say again maybe a two hundred by twelve thirty, but anyway. Yeah, they say it's a long-term correction

[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:46.540]
Well, no, what does that mean long-term correction? What does that mean well for a long for a long time?

[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:51.600]
They've been expecting this kind of a market correction and you believe that I don't know

[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:54.540]
I don't believe anything that's just what they say they don't have any idea

[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:58.900]
They came on here all these experts this morning between nine and nine thirty predicting today was gonna bounce

Yeah, me too. No, I'm not I'm not gonna panic

[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:25.500]
No, that's because you have a lot more money than I do and that's why I'm panicking I guess all my money's tied up

[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.880]
Just like anybody else's it's all tied up in this crap

[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:31.760]
Yep, well, yeah, it's all funny money and I've said for years

[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:35.180]
I always thought when I didn't have any money used to make fun of people invested in the stock market

[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:37.720]
I would always tell them it's like going to the racetrack. It's just a gamble

[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:41.240]
They'd look at me like oh, what do you know you little piece of crap and I think they're right

[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:42.640]
I think the racetrack's a better

[01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:46.120]
Entertainment anyway, they put on a good show for you. Yeah

[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:51.180]
Hey, you're gonna be outside blockbuster at midnight tonight waiting for your first copy of Titanic. Oh, yeah

[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:53.940]
I'm gonna wait for Leo to show up and drag

[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:55.700]
I

[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:56.620]
Got a question for you

[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:02.160]
Why all the venom towards Jimmy now where four years ago you're one of the biggest the cheerleaders

[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.800]
Because I thought he was gonna do a great job in it

[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.340]
But you know something your guy gets only so many chances and he keeps blaming everybody else

[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:11.560]
I think it's time now to put up her shut up so far he hasn't done a damn thing

[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:16.480]
All right, that team shouldn't have even made the playoffs last year for warrant for real bad calling that jets to the track game

[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.320]
The team went about had a chance to be uh-huh

[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:22.020]
I'm not down now. You're right. They wouldn't have had a chance to be embarrassed and humiliated for a second

[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:26.260]
We can't a row by the patriots in a playoffs last year. So I know it's either put up her shut up now Jimmy

[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:31.640]
Yeah, I know. I mean, it's yeah, I just I don't like this thing and he's got he's got such an imperious attitude man

[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:33.240]
That's why I don't he's a hard ass

[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.220]
Well, I can't take even this huh?

[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:40.220]
Everybody knows he's a cocky bastard. Yeah, he can't take even a little bit of criticism, you know, and uh

[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:41.820]
He's good though. I mean, I

[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:43.820]
Well, let's see let's wait and see

[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:47.360]
Exactly. We gotta give him the end of the show before he really criticized him. So okay, he would have

[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.380]
And they're gonna have a lot of time. Okay. Have a great life

[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:53.640]
Tenby for the guy says give him a chance to lose like a nine or ten games that will say goodbye

[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:56.660]
Open line and powered five six seven oh five sixty

[01:23:56.660 --> 01:24:01.660]
Palm five sixty on a mobile one line the Dow is down. It's now he raced the year today gains the Dow

[01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:06.620]
Like even for the whole year. Okay, all those big gigantic gains up to nine three hundred. It's all gone

[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:11.500]
Bye-bye kiss it bye-bye and if you hopped on some of that stuff late like some of us did well

[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:15.760]
Don't hang yourself don't go blow your brains out just because only money

[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:17.680]
It's only money

[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.260]
It'll make it come back someday

[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:22.520]
Moan it

[01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:29.560]
Okay, let's go to Miami hello. Hello, Neil. Yes. How you doing for a sound car? Okay, Neil

[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:34.900]
I wanted to ask you about this hot band trade what you think and uh, what pot band trade the uh with Toronto

[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:38.460]
There isn't any trade. There isn't any trade they keep writing all these articles, you know

[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:40.480]
See, I know this sounds ridiculous

[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.860]
But when something happens then they should write about it

[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:46.320]
But all these people I keep predicting and they're talking about a beat

[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:51.840]
When Brian Marie is able to do something which so far he has done nothing when he's able to do something

[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:57.600]
Then I'll be glad to hear about it, but so far talk pop is cheap. I don't know if it's better to get pot band

[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:02.380]
Or just to get rid of need or my with all his concussions and everything well, so who's gonna be the goal tender

[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:08.480]
Well, we don't have any I mean if Toronto is stupid enough to take a robby need a bar and give away a Felix pot band

[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:13.260]
Is a hell of a damn good goalie by the way a lot better and most people realize if he plays him for with any defense in front of him

[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:17.660]
If Toronto's that dull and they probably are and I should know better than anybody then they ought to grab for it

[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:20.220]
They had her what do it? Well, do you know how much pot band makes?

[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:24.400]
Because that's about three million okay point that was the big thing is they didn't want to pay

[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:30.020]
These are four point five, but yeah, I'm gonna pay him three. I mean, what's the difference? Well, they offered rich your five million

[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:30.580]
Yeah

[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:34.880]
All right, well in closing deal they thought of sports parking

[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:35.800]
Okay

[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:42.400]
We have an open line in date and one inbroward five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line

[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.640]

Which means the rookie camp opens the fifth

[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:51.760]
Uh camp full camp opens September 12 and well sometime the next few years I'm supposed to get my last

[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.380]
tour my last

[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:57.760]
Look see if the a new arena before they finally start with the first exhibition is game in there

[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:01.580]
And I understand the arena is just even more sensational on it was before it's magnificent

[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:06.560]
It's fantastic. How about a team to go in here? Can we get a real team? No, I don't think so don't look like it

[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:10.900]
Now you're asking for a little bit too much and especially with the market crashing the way it is

[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:13.780]
I mean Wayne, you know all that stock. He's got that in worth a craft

[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:17.960]
You know expecting to go out there and spend his harder and money after all these years. He's

[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:18.520]
You know

[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.240]
Of gouging the public to spend a lot of money on some stupid hockey team

[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:27.740]
He's got to watch his peas and cues now baby and they got that mortgage today right? Sorry. That's right in those both times man

And isn't trying to you know what I'm saying?

[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:48.960]

Virgin Mary Rose Lofes is house on the 13th of every month Eden, Toteena pizza

[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:10.680]
What the hell more can you want we got about your crazy people all over the world with this religious crap

I say now that the world economy is inside fallin out of such hard times

[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:21.440]
Let's force all the religious institutions to liquidate their holdings all of this art all of those big buildings

[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:26.080]
All these shrines to agree to this stupidity. Let's gobble up all those billions in dollars

[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.240]

Hey, I think you need to weigh that magic wand here is to stop this big stock clutch. Yeah, can't do it

[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:47.720]
I am an Isaac have erased all their year today gains

[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:53.600]
I just put the flash on there on CNBC did now and then as that car back to where we started back on December 31 last year

[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:56.980]
That's right, and I just think it was ironic right next to Clinton's head there

[01:27:56.980 --> 01:28:02.960]
Why was given a big speech about the both-faring Russia's economy are stocked and dropping nearly 200 points a minute?

[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:07.060]
Yeah, I think it's a Republican conspiracy. I think big Newton's got something to do with it's just

[01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:08.460]
On it just before the election

[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:12.540]
They're gonna come out with that can't star report in the market's gonna go into turmoil and the economy

[01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:18.540]
Which is the one thing the Democrats had going for the economy is in a crapper. I think it's the fixes in and tomorrow

[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:23.700]
We both all those right wingers are sorry selling like raya, but who cares about that? That's a little league stuff

[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:26.720]
I detect a little purple shoe around his eye there

[01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:31.980]
Yeah, make up, and he's also got that oozing stool. Roy! Hey, I tell you that's

[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:37.420]
Business news here. They're the only ones there place at the disclaimer about on the screen telling you the

[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.780]
Warning that this program may be hazardous to your health. Mm-hmm. It's gonna look good

[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:47.300]
But I haven't got any in the market. I'm happy about that. Congratulations, sir. You're gonna sleep a lot better at night

[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:50.600]

That will really live in infamy this day for me

[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:10.480]
Market is down to dial 156 and as that is down

[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.840]
76 which is the equivalent of uh

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:15.460]
76 that's the equivalent of three hundred eighty points

[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:17.620]
Just for those who keep track

[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:19.640]
Not a pretty picture boys and girls

[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:25.120]

On doby somehow you always knew that he was a great big smoking man. His hits were strong and true

[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:50.560]
Without a lot of gotcha he would know what to do. He would know what to do

[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:57.400]
The times they started getting rough. This tiny buzz was tossed

[01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:01.680]
If not for the courage of the old male man his package would be lost

[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:06.960]
His package would be lost and then the police came knocking just this

[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:10.080]
Gilligan began to smile and down Gilligan

[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:12.880]
The bag of weed

So I guess we can forget about america's adultery epidemic. That's next in the world weekly news

[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:41.700]
Forget about that now. We got some heavy-duty crap to give away that should kill the next hour and 56 minutes if I'm in good enough mood to give it away

[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:47.920]
What are we gonna do with all this stuff see this what is is this a radio station or what here? No

[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:52.540]
Don't have enough room. I couldn't fart. I don't have room to squeeze it in here. It's so goddamn tight in this joint

[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:56.640]
That's one thing I'll say for paxny maybe a liar in a phony and a grave robber

[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:00.220]
But at least the guy built us a beautiful studio then we had enough room to do something

[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:07.100]
This I got stuff pile up. I either got the phone or I got the coffee when you got to have the coffee because we got to get the spots on right

[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:15.940]
Beautiful. Okay, we got the phones all lit up, but I can't I can't reach the lines. Okay, so I guess I can't to give any of these away or take any calls

[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:18.560]
Because I can't reach the goddamn phone line to punch him up

[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:25.880]
See this is life in this goddamn radio station. Okay, and then poor tree comes down from engineering this morning and Jim Crawford

[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:33.220]
And he was giving us a song of whoa about these people here and about we don't even know what year we're gonna get those new studios build upstairs

[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:39.060]
But there he had big drill he had a portable drill in his hand. I think he was not as way to see Greg read

[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:44.060]
He said I'm gonna see if I can drill like maybe one or two more matching ones in his head

[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:49.080]
And of course, how could you tell? Okay, let's go to I can't reach it

[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:12.560]
Yeah, that's all it's about with nine from Toronto. I just want to tell you about this possible pot band deal

[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:18.300]
We got a new stadium going on there as well the air Canada center to open like February 20th. Yes against

[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:32.440]
Yeah, I did because what they're doing is through everybody

[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:36.280]
They're screwing everybody for Steven thickets and when you go down to choose your new fee

[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:40.520]
Uh in the location they actually take you and show you where you'll be fitting now

[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:45.600]
The big decide to go ahead and charge the the high paid people at the ridiculous feet over gonna see a charge him or not

[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:49.200]
Yeah, what they've done is the screen the blue line yeah large center

[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:54.580]
I what they call lounges and what'll happen there is you actually have not a piece like

[01:36:55.060 --> 01:37:00.700]
Ten feet in a section and you have a lounge underneath the feeding location where you can go and move it up

[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:06.080]
Between areas. Oh, there'll be a lot of echoing on this year. Oh definitely. I mean those things are running you from

[01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:07.140]
300

[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:14.420]
500,000 first piece. Yeah, but that's Canadian so I'm gonna talk about 50 bucks American you can get one exactly your right

[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:20.360]
But what what's with this need of my deal is Toronto might can't come to this even though they got a great

[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:26.540]
Totally in Joseph pot man is a phenomenal goi when they give them a defense and we just the Joseph

[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:30.300]
Feel is useless to Toronto they have to do something but it's useless unless

[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:33.040]
They're able to get rid of pot man and get something

[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:35.700]
Offensive and uh right now

[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:40.420]
Oh, you're talking to Rob need him right he's offensive. I'll write put out in the sense of their looking for

[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:41.420]
He's a pussy

[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:46.720]
He's a pussy that's always injured that does figure eights out there. I mean Pavelle burry wants out of Vancouver

[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:50.420]
Peter Nedved is floating around in the middle of somewhere that somebody's gonna sign him

[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:52.720]
There's all these really great offensive players out there

[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:57.780]
And the best beliefs and Ken Dryden can and Mike Smith can come up with is gonna be Robbie need your mire for Christ's sake

[01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:04.940]
Well Mike's method is a weasel drawing just yaps away in the pond is that or alone to see more spend a dollar

[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:06.340]
I mean the cheap faster

[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:09.920]
Well, they gave they gave Curtis Joseph six million bucks a year U.S

[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:14.760]
Yeah, and they're done if they shot their their can their load. Yeah, they're low. They're done

[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:20.100]
So I think unfortunately I think we're gonna have a long scene about that game. What's gonna be like last year

[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:25.680]
It's gonna be the leaps in the and the panther just side by side for a contest to see who's gonna be the worth and it's gonna be nip and tuck

[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:28.960]
In fact if that final game against Chicago

[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:34.380]
In if we start in the first one with much draw she makes very uh an interest

[01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:37.260]
Okay, go leave school far soon yet

[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:40.860]
Robbie need to buy a botanian. That's an active desperation if they're gonna get that putt whacker

Like the ravioli and the chicken paramedic me and Joe ordered and something that I would agree if you want it or not

[01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:02.040]
What is it meatballs and sausage with cheese and sauce okay

[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:07.920]
Hey, listen, I'm Tonya man. It's a rough life to market. Oh look at the markets make it a little bit of a comeback

[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.620]
Don't jump yet. Oh, she's too late

[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:15.300]
We had one guy in a goddamn bridge over there in a certain anisee cause way just as yeah

[01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:20.340]
I was just about to tell him too late just hit the guy dim water when I was sunny from the market

[01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:24.220]
Ha, huh. By the way. Have you been by there lately? Oh

[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:36.120]
Where Sonny's market used to be I mean Papa John's is still there but generally speaking it's all ported up

[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:40.200]
And then where that little restaurant used to be there somebody knew is opening that thing up again

[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:44.780]
And for the 400 time and where that motel warehouse used to be I think that's all ported up

[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:48.080]
So that was sunny from the market just job sorry, Sonny

[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:50.660]

So I guess we won't have to go into the world weekly news article about America's adultery epidemic and all the warning signs that your husband is cheating and warning signs that your wife is cheating

[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:28.060]
For example warning stride your husband is cheating. He starts being secretive about clothing when he comes home

[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:29.500]
He quickly changes his clothes

[01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:35.760]
He may be doing this tie tell tale lipstick stains or perfume odors or other scored score stains

[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:37.300]

[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:49.280]

He's probably got everyone it's ever been made. Let's go to a Jupiter. Hello

[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:11.620]
Neil how are you? Okay, I was just sitting there watching the sports channel. Yeah, and they showed him a glider

[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:18.120]
Uh, what was he doing? No, no for September and October of last year

[01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:24.660]
He hit 15 homers. Mm-hmm. So if he did that and he said fifty five

[01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:29.720]
Seven wow unbelievable and they showed so they hit nine

[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:35.740]
So both of them would crack. I'm almost unless uh, they let him get injured. I guarantee they're both gonna break it

[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:38.960]
I mean not even close without a doubt. I think

[01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:41.800]
Unless unless when I'm get hurt, right

[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:46.160]
There is did you and too bad Griffey got colder for you know

[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:49.720]
He was on fire again. He's got 48 but he'll never make it now

[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:54.660]
He went black. How many of those Griffey candy bars? Well, they fight. Would you play in harder teams?

[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:57.520]
I didn't follow him at all

[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:01.920]
No, he was just uh choked. I think is the word you're looking for just just had the slump

[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:06.640]
Yeah, well, I'm sitting there watching his market just killing me man

[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:09.780]
122 it's down 122 and 2436

[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:15.140]
And yeah, well you're ahead of me. That's right. Just look down for one second and drop another two points

[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:18.400]
I just I don't why yeah, you know, you know

[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:21.960]
The worst part of the whole thing is that they keep lying to us

[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:27.100]
And that who's this broad this woman that they have on air who's supposed to be with golden sacks or what

[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:33.980]
And Friday she comes on air again at seven o'clock on CNBC. Friday. Do you have one with Ella her name is and she keeps all

[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:39.880]
The fundamentals of the US market are too strong and market is making it well. It's not just Russia. It's Japan

[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:46.620]
It's all Asia. It's Latin America. Uh, the currency in Canada has crumbled all the all the markets in the world are going to hell in a hand

[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:52.380]
Basket and they keep trying to blue sky to people and the and the consumer confidence in the investor confidence now is history

[01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:56.760]
It's gone. Well, you know, we're in a panic. I don't want you way to panic but they've been a guy damn panic

[01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:57.960]
You said it either

[01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:01.220]
Friday or the day before that

[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:02.860]
about how

[01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:04.720]
We're such followers

[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:11.520]
Yeah, you know, I mean if if by the way GE is 83 and three quarters. I got out of my 90 on Friday

[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:18.660]
You did good. That's right and I wanted it 70. Yeah, so I'm doing okay with that. Thank God, but every time I cash

[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:26.360]
It's it's like when the Japanese or the Russians or the Germans who may when their market is bad we just follow in suit

[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.600]
Instead of just sitting tight and letting not worry about their problem. Yeah, I think I think it's the fault of these people on CNBC

[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:37.440]
I'm gonna blame them. Uh, they have a lot to do with it and and some of their

[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:43.500]
AOL down seven and three eights 88 and seven eights AOL somebody yesterday was trying to give me a song to dance by AOL at 96

[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:49.940]

[01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:53.560]
And unfortunately, the Pember Pryons never dropped a big bomb like that

[01:46:53.980 --> 01:47:00.020]
Unfortunately, I have a AOL and I almost got out this morning at 10 o'clock and I should have

[01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:27.200]

[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:33.260]
Don't have all the crew come over here and tape the shows and then uh, they'll just go back and oh, guess what we're not putting it on tonight

Forget it. You're not the fair master the bum master

[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:34.900]
But I got a confess. I do enjoy my friend Ron Popeel because he said the snake roll salesman. I can't turn those damn things on

[01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:39.860]
Because it's a bunch of crap like that pasta maker, which he said he adorged me each one for free

[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:42.520]
He was well worth the price at twice the price

[01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:48.040]
You want some of those videos?

[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.100]

Patch our men our fences with whoever sent these videos. I said almost enough. What do you give me a look like that?

[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:22.780]

[01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:29.120]

[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:38.820]
Uh, I've got news for it this if this would have happened like two months ago in the middle of the dog days of the summer at that point my approach would have been a lot different

[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:42.880]
I just said oh yeah, here's a bunch of great videos from and then I would have said it

[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:46.380]

[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:22.160]
a new deal yeah dollars plunge curbing many luxuries with the Canadian dollar hitting record

[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:27.060]

floor to this winter the retired couple from Kuvek will be browsing not buying a when they take

[02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:36.540]
the bus to flea markets and instead of fine dining they foresee skillet dinners in their kitchen

[02:24:36.540 --> 02:24:42.140]

[02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:51.800]
on the phone from canada i hate the winter the money isn't very good at this time but our health

[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:56.760]
is better than money it says they offer the best scenario that soft floor to can open for this winter

[02:24:56.760 --> 02:25:01.520]
a continuing flow of Canadians who opt only to cut back on spending or shorten their stays because

[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:05.960]
of their weakened currency but more likely the tri-county region will see a drop in arrivals from

[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:10.680]
Canada the largest single source of international visitors already the number of Canadian tourists

[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:15.220]
has dropped 9% in the first half of this year to mommy date the area's top destination

[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:22.420]
and just wait till the season comes and drops another 25 30% oh we may all be broke but we'll be

[02:25:22.420 --> 02:25:30.060]
