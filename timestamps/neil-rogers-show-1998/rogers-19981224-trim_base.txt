[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]
Sport radio 560 Wanderway every coming out. No.

[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.460]
Waterdale presents the Neil Rogers show to talk to Neil called 560.

[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.900]
And then there's that for the signal to the Tonya. No.

[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.720]
For the Emperor or pound 560.

[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.340]
Okay, here you go.

[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.440]
There's the opinions of Neil. His guests call is there.

[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.600]
Anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisitions

[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.340]
or the Beasley broadcast group.

[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.600]
No.

[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.420]
Now Neil Rogers on Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.500]
No.

[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.580]
No.

[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.660]
No.

[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.120]
Talking on a sports show.

[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.820]
Trying to be my show.

[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.840]
Your voice sounds good like a seven year old girl.

[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.660]
A little sports show.

[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.180]
What else are you there for?

[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.700]
Chelsea.

[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.440]
Chelsea.

[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.640]
Talking like a baby.

[00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.460]
Who needs a little training?

[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.540]
Oh, I can feel understand.

[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.700]
You don't sound like a man.

[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.440]
Reboots of rubber bands.

[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.780]
That joke.

[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.880]
Your throat comes.

[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.680]
Chelsea.

[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.240]
Chelsea.

[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.680]

[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.280]
Oh.

[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.400]
Chelsea.

[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.500]
Your lucky management.

[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.540]
Chelsea.

[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.360]
You don't belong there on the air.

[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.060]
And Chelsea.

[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.820]
The sport can wait till your voice cracks.

[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.400]
Cause anyone who sounds like that should find another job.

[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.120]
If they should only take you back when both your baby's dropped.

[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.280]
Chelsea.

[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.040]
Chelsea.

[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.480]
When you're gone and grow up.

[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.280]
You make a lot of throw up.

[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.340]
You silly, squeaky, blue.

[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.200]
Go to broadcasting school.

[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.240]
Your free to visit boys.

[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.620]
Thank you.

[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.520]
Now I talk.

[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.380]

[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.740]
Yes.

[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.620]
Your.

[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.400]
Yes.

[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.440]
Your.

[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.240]
Yes.

[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.860]
Yes.

[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.260]
Your.

[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.480]
Yes.

[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.180]
Your.

[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.120]

[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.720]
You are.

[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.460]
Oh, Neil.

[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.900]
Oh.

[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.580]
Neil.

[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.560]
Neil.

[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.060]
That's power.

[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.800]
Then I'll present.

[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.820]
I'm the most powerful god day man in the world.

[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.340]
Yes.

[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.020]
I am.

[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.800]
Neil.

[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.920]
Neil.

[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.340]
That's power.

[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.040]
Then I'll present.

[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.140]
I'm the most powerful god day man in the world.

[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.460]
So is the correct.

[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.740]
The burgers are made out of people.

[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.460]
Oh, it's beautiful.

[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.240]
I'm sick of everything.

[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.320]
Just that taste of smell.

[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:49.220]
How do you feel?

[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.880]
Well, 86% of newborn boys in this country are sick of size.

[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.700]
They procedure as widely performed without any sort of anesthesia.

[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.840]
I have no precution.

[00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.780]
I'm dead on it.

[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.780]
Oh, it's just Neil.

[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.420]
Oh, it's just Neil.

[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.580]
Oh, it's just Neil.

[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.160]
I need you to find me.

[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.080]
Oh, it's Neil.

[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.080]
Neil.

[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.660]
Oh, God.

[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.140]
Oh, God.

[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.160]
Oh, God.

[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.800]
Hi, Neil.

[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.380]
Hi, Neil.

[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.600]
Hi, Neil.

[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.240]
I will ask you tonight's blockbuster.

[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.560]
Ready other companies that perpetuate this kind of behavior.

[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.480]
Check out the economy.

[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.240]
You're spurping.

[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.060]
Look, Neil.

[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.520]
It's an all-general product.

[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.900]
Sure.

[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.880]
I don't have a bones for dogs.

[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.640]
You're high, eh?

[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.380]
I know that before you work or you're righteous.

[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.500]
Father, old school.

[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.180]
God.

[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.420]
Damn, God.

[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.260]
Oh, God.

[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.840]
Oh, God.

[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.840]
Mr. Mary, you have to see this.

[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.180]
No, God.

[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.000]
Just a liquor.

[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.620]
How's that hand job?

[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.340]
Something on hand.

[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.240]
Oh, he has no feet.

[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.640]
He doesn't do much of it as well when I'm not.

[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.320]
He doesn't.

[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.580]
That is great radio.

[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.760]
I am that hemorrhage.

[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.520]
I only have a longer cord than a piece of crap.

[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.040]
Look at this.

[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.320]
How sure is this damn thing?

[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.960]
I'm going to pick this cord and I'm going to shove it right up his neck.

[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.660]
OK, Neil.

[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.600]
This place operates like a freak.

[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.920]
It's not how it really does.

[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.960]
I want to be left a freak alone, OK?

[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.240]
I'm not man and I'm the sixth grader boy.

[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.960]
That they made.

[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.040]
Look, particularly.

[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.340]
Oh, boy.

[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.580]
Kill, kill.

[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.140]
Oh, see, that's their fate.

[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.140]
Oh, there's a winner.

[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.880]
That's the path again.

[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.380]
I'm there.

[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.760]
Kill.

[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.440]
Kill.

[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.880]
Kill.

[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.420]
Kill.

[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.240]
More power than a ill-president, man.

[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.760]
I'm the most powerful god damn man in the world.

[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.280]
So is the correction.

[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.880]
1045-60WQM.

[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.600]
Merry Christmas from all your friends here at QIM and from us too.

[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.920]
And we're going to, man, you talk about playing the rack.

[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.780]
We're going to play stuff you haven't heard in a Koon's age.

[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.840]
All kinds of good stuff today between now and two o'clock.

[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.520]
Because it's a holiday god damn it.

[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.900]
So I'm at the hockey game last night.

[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.920]
Was that really a hockey game?

[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.100]
No.

[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.080]
I'm there last night.

[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.540]
And my good friend Howard Kleinberg.

[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.640]
And so there's two of the fine people in this town, by the way,

[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.620]
two of my favorite people, Mr. Mrs. Howard Kleinberg.

[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.700]
They're the good people, damn it.

[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.040]
Yes.

[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.120]
So anyway, Howard comes over to me and he's giving me a song of dance

[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.040]
about how sick he was.

[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.880]
He had a little hip problem.

[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:03.540]
Now he's doing great.

[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.020]
Thank god.

[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.500]
And so he says to me, so they're really blowing out the first team, huh?

[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.240]
I said, yes.

[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.020]
So anyway, I mean, it's just, it's amazing, you know.

[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.060]
So let's just keep in guessing, okay?

[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.580]
Are they really?

[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.880]
No.

[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.540]
Yes.

[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.160]
No.

[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.040]
Yes.

[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.140]
No.

[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.920]
Yes.

[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.400]
Maybe you'll just have to keep listening, huh?

[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.900]
Let's play that game like they tried over the way that babbling broke.

[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.520]
Let me say it again.

[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.480]
I have no problem.

[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.500]
I'll publicize anybody on any other station.

[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.960]
Because we have no fear.

[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.720]
We're not concerned.

[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.160]
We're not the least bit concerned that Brook is going to like give Hank any stiff competition

[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.580]
otherwise.

[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.900]
In fact, I'm sure he's like kissing the ground that they put that babbling brook on in the afternoon.

[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.120]
What wonderful competition.

[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.880]
Anybody could only pray for that.

[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.840]
God, I can answer to anybody's prayers, right?

[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.080]
Yes.

[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.100]
So anyway, I'd speak on the game last night.

[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.380]
I have just a few brief comments.

[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.080]
It's the holidays.

[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.100]
I don't want to put like a negative spin on anything.

[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.820]
Although there is a little negativity in the paper here this morning.

[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.020]
Finally, it says in the hockey column, this is in the scum stand also must be that fat Michael Russo.

[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.140]
He says the new building is trying to work out.

[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.460]
It's never ending kinks.

[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.780]
Maybe they can have the kinks in concert there, huh?

[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.100]
Yes.

[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.360]
The sound coming out of the loudspeakers continues to be either too loud, too low or too mumbled almost all the time.

[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.440]
And then the middle of the play plays periodically.

[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.120]
The horn sounds quickly creating confusion on the ice.

[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.960]
There you go.

[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.640]
Holy at the macarena, baby.

[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.080]
The National Carvebeckle Center.

[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.240]
We're the only arena in the world that has these extra added coupements, okay?

[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.160]
No extra charge.

[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.760]
You know, before the game, and there's poor kids that I have no ideas from the young hockey players,

[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.960]
and budding, you know, future NHL stars, they're out there giving them an award for whatever.

[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.920]
And the PA,

[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.300]
and if you're life depended on it, you couldn't understand the word that this guy is saying.

[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.060]
If they held it, oozy up your ass.

[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.460]
You couldn't decipher what this poor bastard saying on the PA.

[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.400]
And yes, the horn does come in there, which is good because it kind of wakes us up a little bit every now and then.

[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.320]
I think that's what it's for.

[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.540]
Kind of a wake up sound.

[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.880]
Yes.

[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.160]
Right.

[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.100]
But poor, that was in it.

[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.340]
The first time in the new arena, I will probably say that I left early.

[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.120]
I mean, real early.

[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.340]
Once a Washington score, there's second goal with about five minutes left in the second period.

[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.460]
Got up, made a B line out of that joint.

[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.800]
Am I a please that I did that?

[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.060]
Yes.

[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.480]
You bet.

[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.860]
Oh, man.

[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.780]
Talk about a coma.

[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.180]
But anyway, did not listen.

[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.100]
I just want to say this and I really mean it.

[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.440]
I'm not going to carry on about the fact that the red light you can't see it from where we are when the goal is scored the and about the offense.

[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.760]
I don't give a sh** me more.

[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.140]
That's right.

[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.460]
I mean, you are what you are.

[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.080]
Like they said in Godfather 3, was it?

[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.140]
Yeah, when he said the Vincent, he said you are what you are.

[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.100]
A piece of the thing that to the gay son.

[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.380]
No, well, that was the other story.

[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.260]
That was off camera.

[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.680]
But at any rate, so we are what you are.

[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.000]
That's the so called fans.

[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.900]
They have no clue.

[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.900]
If you listen to the conversation that's going on around.

[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.220]
Yeah, we got to have still bars.

[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.740]
What team is he on now?

[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:54.920]
Who's on that tape?

[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:55.520]
Yeah, right.

[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.360]
They know from nothing.

[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.520]
But their favorite.

[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.720]
See, I've discovered what the problem is they really don't want to see hockey.

[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:07.580]
They want to see they want to do all the stuff I talked about the wave and they look up on the scoreboard and they want to see the WWF.

[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.140]
Or they want to see, you know, Mike Tyson choose somebody zero off.

[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.400]
They want to see boxing, wrestling.

[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.360]
They want to see brawling.

[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.760]
That's what maybe a little mud wrestling.

[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.820]
That's what they want to see, right?

[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.700]
There you go.

[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.260]
Because they've got a major Peter problem at the Macarena.

[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.980]
A big black guy named Peter.

[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:23.960]
I'm going to tell you this guy.

[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.580]
There were showing pictures in between periods of the different players with a little Christmas messages.

[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.420]
And, you know, here's Ray Whitney up there and here's Billy Lindsay.

[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.480]
You know, here's guys that you could like a lot.

[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.020]
And here's Peter Warrant.

[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.340]
And then of course, what he got into one of his 18 brawls during the game, including one which he didn't get a penalty for,

[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.920]
which is very bizarre, but nevertheless.

[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.380]
And when he, you know, he's picking up his glove and his stick and the holding in,

[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.800]
three sitting ovation on the same penalty.

[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.080]
They're obsessed.

[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.180]
They really believe that this is a hockey player.

[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.880]
And like I said, I don't give a shot.

[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.340]
And if that's your idea of what is a hockey player, then good luck to you, okay?

[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.520]
And that just reinforces what I said the other day.

[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.340]
Yeah, we just ought to have the grab ass out there.

[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.220]
Everybody party and get up, run around.

[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.780]
You have to worry about standing in front of other people.

[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.860]
Forget the game, okay?

[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.760]
In fact, we can have a little, what we'll do is we'll have a bunch of big black guys beating the crap out of each other out there.

[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.900]
Right in the middle of the adjoin, huh?

[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.460]
I was going to say the middle of the ice, but we would melt the ice because the refrigeration caused the fortune.

[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.400]
So we want to save away in the 31 million bucks for the salaries.

[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.660]
And also that refrigeration system just shut that baby down, baby.

[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:28.640]
Shut it off.

[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.500]
Yeah, I'm serious.

[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.380]
Not a good idea.

[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.820]
Yeah, I thought they called that box.

[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.540]
No, no, not boxing.

[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:40.260]
No, they want to see, that's why they do like boxing because it's usually two big black guys beating on each other.

[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.800]
And they love that.

[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.560]
White guys love it.

[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.140]
But just, I mean, just a free for all, not boxing.

[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.060]
No rules, you know, just beating a living crap, maybe, you know, bringing each other like to the edge of death, maybe like into a coma.

[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.220]
They would love it.

[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:52.600]
Oh!

[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.920]
So that's my idea for the new year for the Immacurate of the National Carrectal Center.

[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.800]
A putrid performance last night, by the way, boys.

[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.500]
Everybody's stuck to join out.

[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.440]
There wasn't one player on our team.

[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.200]
That even Ray Whitney stuck to join out.

[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.300]
Everybody on the play.

[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.980]
I mean, you guys were brutal.

[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.000]
It was pathetic.

[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.640]
Little warming here, by the way.

[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.500]
Isn't it just me?

[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.120]
That'd be you.

[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.020]
That'd be me for you.

[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.100]
You have poisoned myself with that.

[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.680]
You have poisoned myself with all that rig because they had to kill about 400 ants in here already this morning.

[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.600]
Which is kind of nice that you work for a company, especially a Christmas time that can't afford an exterminator.

[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:23.920]
Yes.

[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.240]
No, stop!

[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.300]
Yes.

[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.760]
It's made in the evening.

[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.100]
The pathers have lost again.

[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.800]
So I'm looking for doggy.

[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.740]
Some things I must say to him.

[00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.540]
And when I find him.

[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.940]
Before I punch out his life.

[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.840]
I say you asshole.

[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.480]
You coached very bad tonight.

[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:25.860]
You coached very bad because you didn't listen to your uncle bill.

[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.880]
He's the endless eye.

[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.260]
The real McCoy.

[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:38.340]
And you watch us stop peace of hand from Canada.

[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.240]
Oh, Canada, Tom.

[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:47.300]
I've died in an old life here.

[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.960]
Hey beer drinkers.

[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.420]
Do you find that your beer not only fills you up, it binds you up.

[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:55.760]
Yes.

[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.820]
You need a beer that will help you loosen up.

[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:05.460]
Introducing the beer that not only tastes great, it packs a mega high fiber wallet.

[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.620]
It's the first beer that's also a laxative.

[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.880]
We call it Shats.

[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.360]
As a T.A.T.

[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.620]
A Poster V.S.

[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.300]
Shats.

[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.480]
All the cats get their hats to the man who's drinking Shats.

[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.460]
The man who needs some fibers is true and fair.

[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:33.400]
When the chef and the chef are not just number one, the chef is always number two.

[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.480]
Hi, I'm Phil Throne from a Shats group.

[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.820]
Before yourself, a chef.

[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.880]
And see why it's making a splash all over the country.

[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.580]
Shats, the laxative beer.

[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.860]
Shats is rude with the highest quality hops in barley.

[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.760]
Then we add our secret ingredient, whole-turned-tone.

[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.580]
Not too much, just a pinch.

[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:06.040]
Every chat beer is certified with 12 essential vitamins, so you're always guaranteed a good healthy Shats.

[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:12.360]
Shats is available in the 6th-ounce little squirt or the 64-ounce pig logger.

[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.320]
And every chat is paper to one end, so your can won't slam Shats.

[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:24.620]
We here at Shats are satan by the recent passing of Adolf Shats, founder of the Shats Family Brewery,

[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.740]
better known as the Old Brick Shats.

[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:35.920]
In fact, Adolf loved his beer so much, his last wish was to be interred in a giant fat of Shats.

[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:43.080]
So come on, when it's time to take a load off, crack open a chat.

[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.080]
You will say the parade calls for you to leave this all in its way.

[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:54.780]
Oh, no bullpen, I kill that, or you'll hear.

[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.940]
Give us shots of pop and soon you'll hear a pop.

[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.180]
Shats is making chairs for other pigs.

[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.740]
Don't just take any beer, take us shots.

[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:14.500]
And for you T-toddlers, try our new high fiber non-alcoholic beer.

[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.360]
We call it O-stool.

[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.220]
O-stool.

[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.480]
A sample one today.

[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.740]
And don't forget Shats' light, Shats' dark.

[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:29.720]
And for those with diverticulitis, proctitis and polyphosis, doctors direct them to try new Shats' red.

[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.760]
Shats' red, a division of fricking the ministry's flushing new.

[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.740]
Okay, 1017, if you think that's disgusting, wait for your names of these octoplets.

[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.780]
I didn't realize that these were dark, complex people down there in Houston.

[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.540]
That we're doing the fertility thing and had a litter of 600 babies.

[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.260]
The world's only living octoplets were given names on Wednesday in the tradition of their parents African tribe.

[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.880]
Time right in, well, what we just be talking about here a few days ago on this show.

[00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.900]
We're always timing, we're always right on top of it.

[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.420]
The hospital had been identifying the children by letters of the alphabet.

[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:17.280]
Since seven of them arrived Sunday by a cesarean section, the first child was born on December 8th to IYKE, a Yiki Lewis Udobe, left and his wife, Nikkem Chukwa.

[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:21.900]
Chukwu, MKEM, CHU, KWU.

[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.140]
The couple said they named the children the tradition of the Igbo tribe.

[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.680]
The major ethnic group in their native Nigeria, Nigeria.

[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.940]
We want to honor God and celebrate his gifts to us in the names we give our eight children.

[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.960]
The couple said in the statement, Lewis is the surname for all eight.

[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.920]
Also on Wednesday, police confirmed that the octoplet's father had been charged in September.

[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:52.500]
He had been charged in September with domestic assault after an incident in which he allegedly struck his mother-in-law during an argument with his wife.

[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:59.020]
These charges are bogus that is attorney Rick Castlebury, a crowd for Lewis's set for February.

[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.580]
Thank God for those fertility drugs.

[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.020]
Thank the Lord for that.

[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.220]
Texas Children's Hospital where the babies remained in critical condition with 85% chance for survival.

[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.040]
Released their names, translations and given nicknames.

[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:21.980]
Baby A born almost two weeks before her siblings and is Chukwu, Chukwu, Buka, Nikme, Gika,

[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.400]
which means God is great. She'll be called Ibuka.

[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.500]
Not to be confused with Ibuka.

[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:35.200]
Baby B, the first of the seven Sunday deliveries is Chidnima Anulika, which means God is beautiful.

[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.480]
Chidi is her nickname.

[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.520]

[00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:19.330]
From the show.

[00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.630]
Whoa!

[00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:22.310]
We're taking up four years.

[00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:23.610]
We're from the show.

[00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:25.930]
We're from the show.

[00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:27.710]
We're from the show.

[00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.490]
That's a little more new home.

[00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.930]
One nine five at the local back store.

[00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.930]
On the end you could add four more to the turtle.

[00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:40.330]
Yeah, do the turtle.

[00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:41.250]
All right.

[00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.410]
That's that's that's your ever gone home.

[00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:49.870]
Well, when we got here it's Richard Geer with the turtle

[00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:52.290]
and the tube and the mattress here do the turtle.

[00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:54.750]
Do the turtle.

[00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:59.470]
That's that's that's your ever gone home.

[00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:03.110]
You could have a puppy.

[00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.030]
You could have a pussy cat.

[00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:10.730]
But when you got a turtle you'll know where it's at.

[00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:16.270]
If one out the floor choose the one with the night is clawed to the turtle.

[00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:18.650]
To the turtle.

[00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.510]
Wow, that's damn bad.

[00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:23.530]
Don't have a water hole.

[00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.490]
You friends and actors who come from the UK.

[00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:45.550]
Charming and pleasant in a quite friendly way.

[00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:49.890]
A sense of humor to make someone chuckle.

[00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:54.330]
I saw who they got women's easing buckhoops.

[00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:57.150]
You was caught by copping Hollywood.

[00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:01.770]
They say that he was up to no good.

[00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:09.910]
Fans on that crying he caused the big mob when you got a hooker and got a blow job.

[00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:13.430]
Get a hooker and get a blow job.

[00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:14.070]
All right.

[00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.310]
In the back he cheered down on his knob.

[00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:25.850]
Stop broke it up they saw her head bob when you got a hooker and got a blow job.

[00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:29.290]
Raise your English known as sex they drink too much tea.

[00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:32.910]
Unless you're part of the royal family.

[00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:39.590]
But you rest not like that he's no evil snob so he got a hooker.

[00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.730]
He got a blow job.

[00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.450]
Get a hooker and get a blow job.

[00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.110]
In the back he cheered down on his knob.

[00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:54.850]
Stop broke it up they saw her head bob when you got a hooker.

[00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.290]
They got a blow job.

[00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.630]
That was the most you've ever had.

[00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.290]
You got a blow job.

[00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.510]
Yeah you got a blow job.

[00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.830]
He was a hooker.

[00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.190]
He just got a hooker.

[00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.510]
I was just so out of sync with you.

[00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:16.850]
They loved the game early last night when homelwatch the rest of that depressing hockey game expecting fully here.

[00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:21.530]
Rumors say they put the biscuit in the basket but it never happened because they stopped.

[00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:22.090]
That's right.

[00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.270]
Oh it was brutal.

[00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:24.570]
Nice job there by the way Neil.

[00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:25.590]
Nice choice leaving early.

[00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:25.970]
Good.

[00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:29.090]
Okay by the way our total for cent of one is 122,874.

[00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:35.530]
So we're right on the precipice of 123,000 and is the van going out to the air not?

[00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.710]
Yes.

[00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.650]
Well you said that kind of like in a very...

[00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:40.910]
Yes.

[00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:43.090]
...in a very enthusiastic way.

[00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.130]
So the van is going out.

[00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:46.730]
Are they going to commercial in the federal highway?

[00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:48.090]
Like we should did like the...

[00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:48.330]
No.

[00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.870]

[00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:50.590]
Yeah where they going?

[00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:54.150]
They're going to the east side marios which is sort of in front of the adventure mall.

[00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:55.190]
I bet very very busy.

[00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:56.590]
They're obsessed with a guy named Adventurimall.

[00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.470]
They're at the very busy location.

[00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:01.290]
It's a very busy location but that's not where our audience is.

[00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:06.450]
Well you talk about over there must be some hot chicks that they're looking to get numbers from or something in that area.

[00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.230]
Because that is not where the audience is.

[00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:10.190]
This Adventurim thing they're obsessed with it.

[00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:12.830]
I mean our new balanced people are an Adventurim.

[00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:13.290]
We love them.

[00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:14.570]
Ben and Jerry is their an Adventurim.

[00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:15.510]
We love them profusely.

[00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:20.150]
But other than that...

[00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:22.150]
Is there anybody even we even know an Adventurim?

[00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:22.290]
No.

[00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:23.750]
There you go. I rest my case.

[00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:26.470]
But well they'll go out there and we'll give you all the details that'll be there in a little while.

[00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:32.130]
I don't understand these guys but I don't want to go all the way out there east and port Lauderdale on quite frankly who can blame them.

[00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:34.830]
So we're going to be playing the rack playing all kinds of good stuff.

[00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:36.470]
Maybe I'll take color too.

[00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.850]
I don't know.

[00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.050]
Because you know the cause yesterday?

[00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:40.170]
They really did.

[00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:44.170]
Now what's all these rumors I'm hearing this morning on the worst team I'm driving in right before I turned it off

[00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:47.030]
about how rumors signed his new deal last night.

[00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.190]
And these are going to be the voice of the Panthers run to you.

[00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.450]
How come they're hearing about it?

[00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:51.350]
I'm not hearing about it.

[00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:54.930]
I mean they've been telling me that he was negotiating and was right on the verge of it.

[00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:59.150]
And so all of a sudden they're breaking the big news on the worst team on a show that's going off the year.

[00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:01.230]
My God, and you wonder why they're going off the year?

[00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.830]
They stuck.

[00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.230]
Twenty before 11 and 560 WQIN.

[00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:04.970]
It's alive.

[00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:06.250]
I am not announcing.

[00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:12.470]
Since the 70s revival it's a common scene in many doctors offices.

[00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.710]
You gotta tell me please, why can't I dance?

[00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:19.170]
Well I'm afraid you have white man in gyros.

[00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:22.890]
White man in gyros.

[00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:27.690]
A tragic affliction causing so many to give up trying to get down.

[00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:30.790]
Stand alive or have a stand alive?

[00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.190]
The symptoms are easy to spot.

[00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:38.670]
The inability to snap your fingers or clap your hands anywhere near the beat of music.

[00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:39.070]
Why?

[00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:41.970]
They're just saving you.

[00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:47.110]
They're stinging causes and instant gag reactions to all those standing next to you.

[00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:48.330]
Oh my God.

[00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:53.830]
And of course when you're out no one wants to stand next to you.

[00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:54.470]
Hi guys.

[00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:56.570]
Wait, wait up.

[00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:57.270]
Wait up.

[00:34:57.370 --> 00:34:57.370]

[00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:57.850]
Wait up.

[00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:02.510]
We could say there's hope for white man in gyros but there is it.

[00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:06.090]
We only recommended course of action in rhythmic abstinence.

[00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.230]
Well there must be something you can do.

[00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.510]
No, just stop what you're doing.

[00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.490]
You're embarrassing that a lot of us.

[00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.170]

Tonight on ABC, Experience Christmas, the NYBD Blueway, Bucknaked, and Ralph.

[00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:47.090]
Phil Beyer, I'm f***ing home.

[00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:47.610]
Whoops.

[00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:48.390]
You're making it.

[00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:50.730]
Andy, I'm so f***ing glad to see you.

[00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.370]
I have a f***ing surprise.

[00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:54.250]
Of course you're f***ing naked.

[00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:56.150]
Not that f***ing cold, man.

[00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:59.170]
You got me a f***ing Christmas present.

[00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.470]
That's so f***ing sweet.

[00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:05.230]
Thanks, your f***ing big ass f***ing cold bag and f***ing second mother f***ing poop who had.

[00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:06.070]
My pleasure.

[00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:07.530]
Hey, let's f***.

[00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:11.890]
I better remove my holster.

[00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:16.930]
It's launching sun for everyone, NYBD Blue, the Christmas special.

[00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:20.850]
Tonight, right after Luther Campbell's Christmas Carol on ABC.

[00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:29.430]
Since everything and everyone at Disney World is out of the closet so to speak, we now have special gay days.

[00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.030]
We've changed the rides to suit our lifestyle.

[00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:36.070]
Yo, ho, ho, be a splash bugler on butt-pirate to the Caribbean.

[00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:41.510]
And we've modified the tunnel of terror so you can ride with Mickey's new domestic partner, Gerald Gell.

[00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:43.410]
Hey, it's Gerald Gell here.

[00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:48.350]
Make sure you try and stay around my leg cause that's so f***ing.

[00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.770]
Oh, boy, I was the bitch.

[00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:51.530]
Shut up.

[00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:57.190]
I still remember getting my first candy from my grandfather.

[00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:00.710]
It was worthless original and I was poor.

[00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:03.090]
And I remember it like it was only yesterday.

[00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:06.310]
Hey, Gellie, let's play a game.

[00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:06.870]
What?

[00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.530]
Just sort of gotten my bucket.

[00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:10.230]
A piece of candy.

[00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:12.390]
Hey, I'm guarded by a snake.

[00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:13.150]
Let's go.

[00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.610]
Grandpa, I don't want to play this game anymore.

[00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:16.330]
Who's gay?

[00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:18.770]
Let's play, play the candy and the crevice.

[00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:21.590]
Oh, Grandpa, I don't always know when you put it there.

[00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:26.050]
Yes, those games would grandpa sharp me for life.

[00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:31.510]
Which is why now that I'm the grandfather, I'm scouring a whole new generation with worthless original.

[00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:35.130]
Hey, Timmy. Say hi to Wet Willie, the worthless wonderworld.

[00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:37.110]
Oh, no, not the Wonderworld.

[00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:38.430]
Worthless original.

[00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:41.330]
Giving children nightmares for over 60 years.

[00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:45.950]
All right.

[00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:55.390]
Don't forget that you're a friend.

[00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:57.050]
Okay.

[00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:07.550]
No.

[00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:16.810]
There's.

[00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:27.750]
And I need.

[00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:31.490]
Yes, yes, yes.

[00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:35.870]
Don't bow guard that joint by bridge.

[00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:39.110]
That's all around.

[00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:39.770]
No.

[00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:45.970]
Don't bow guard that joint by bridge.

[00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:49.030]
Oh, yes, that's all now.

[00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:02.990]
Roll.

[00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:06.490]

[00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.050]
Another one.

[00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:16.710]
Just like the other one.

[00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.630]
Okay.

[00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:21.290]
This one seems about step.

[00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:25.490]
I don't have a mother.

[00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:30.990]
I don't move my head.

[00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.410]
I don't move my friend.

[00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.710]
I don't have a little job.

[00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:40.570]
I don't move my head.

[00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:41.230]
All right.

[00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:42.450]
My friend.

[00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:45.810]
Just pass it over now.

[00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:55.150]
And the more time it's on you.

[00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:58.470]
Just pass it over.

[00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:04.110]
And the more time it's on you.

[00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:11.330]
And the more time it's on you.

[00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.110]
If your toothpaste doesn't taste great,

[00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:17.850]
your kids don't brush long enough,

[00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:20.050]
which could lead to ugly, tartar buildup.

[00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:22.170]
The solution, regular checkups,

[00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.170]
and brushing with new crusts that tartar control toothpaste

[00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:26.570]
lays with crack cocaine.

[00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:30.130]
Hey, son, almost got in there.

[00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:31.430]
Brush and crack, boss.

[00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:32.190]
Brush and crusts.

[00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:34.070]
Crust is not only clinically proven.

[00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:35.670]
It's also highly addictive.

[00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.390]
See your kids will brush and brush and brush.

[00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:41.170]
And brush and brush and brush.

[00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:44.010]
Come on, Billy, it's been 45 minutes.

[00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.030]
Brush and, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

[00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:47.010]
If you're not careful,

[00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:48.970]
you're going to wear those teeth down to little nothing.

[00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:50.110]
Oh, God, no!

[00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:51.230]
Crust, son.

[00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.310]
Almost got a crust.

[00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.530]
Hook your kids on a healthy habit for life.

[00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:57.910]
Brush and with new crusts with crack cocaine.

[00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:00.610]
Sure, I'm going to be late for work now,

[00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:02.290]
but it's good to see Billy brushing.

[00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:04.530]
Get out of the man, this is a car jacking.

[00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:05.350]
Billy, what are you doing?

[00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:06.050]
I sit out.

[00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:08.270]
Billy, what are you doing?

[00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:10.450]
Cut it out of the car to get the crusts.

[00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:11.630]
New crust toothpaste,

[00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:12.970]
laced with crack cocaine,

[00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.970]
recommended by 9 out of 10 drug addicts.

[00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:18.570]
Discover, diuretics.

[00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:22.350]
Is life an endless nightmare of confusion in chaos,

[00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:24.030]
leading to a bleak nothingness?

[00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:25.650]
Or is it just me, PJ?

[00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:28.730]
Why do I have dreams about my mother in Phran?

[00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:29.890]
Page 69.

[00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:33.170]
Why did I give my life savings to a bizarre cult religion

[00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.450]
founded by a bad science fiction writer?

[00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:36.510]
Page 1999.

[00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:40.790]
Am I worthy of seventh-level zardons, or am I a butthead?

[00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:42.570]
Page 25, 25.

[00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:45.450]
Discover, diuretics.

[00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:47.950]
Flushing questions from the mind.

[00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.550]
Is it field of counter, field of movement,

[00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:52.430]
diuretics by Elrond Havab,

[00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:55.250]
over 20 million copies sold, and you believe it?

[00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:59.010]
No.

[00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:06.950]
All right.

[00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:11.290]
You, who's fighting so,

[00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:14.190]
must take it slow.

[00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:17.710]
Prove that you're inside.

[00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:20.570]
Don't say,

[00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:23.510]
with even still,

[00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:26.410]
for grandmas,

[00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.090]
or even Neil Young.

[00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:32.690]
Tree,

[00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:35.770]
you're never well.

[00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:38.830]
No drink like hell.

[00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:42.390]
It'll surely go bad.

[00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:44.390]
Holy.

[00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:48.190]
Just keep it clean.

[00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:51.230]
It can't be fixed.

[00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.590]
You'll need a donor.

[00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:00.510]
Don't you ever party hard?

[00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:03.510]
If you do, you could die.

[00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:07.330]
Or just wait in a long flight.

[00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:14.330]
Like David Trussby.

[00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.630]
The Jeff River kissers well behind.

[00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.430]
Yes.

[00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:25.930]
Does he have a reason

[00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:27.790]
to sort the best thing this guy?

[00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:28.170]
Yes.

[00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:30.150]
He's constantly falling.

[00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:31.790]
And a puppy can fall.

[00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.830]
The Jeff River kissers well behind.

[00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:35.670]
Yes.

[00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:38.210]
And ever since they traded through

[00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:40.290]
they been playing real quality.

[00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:44.250]
The reason they gave it was to stay the key line.

[00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:48.370]
And we know that Chris made me a pretty nice guy.

[00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:50.510]
Muddy, fumbles, and he stumbles,

[00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:51.990]
and tricks on the school.

[00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:54.510]
I insist that that's a dying bird.

[00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.930]
He says,

[00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:55.930]
Yes.

[00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:58.310]
The thieves in the clothes

[00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:00.590]
and they'll never say why.

[00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:02.550]
Just sending it easy,

[00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.650]
just use I all the time.

[00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:07.450]
So Jeff River kissers well behind.

[00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:08.110]
Yes.

[00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:08.970]

[00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:13.890]
Clean it on my child's nose.

[00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:19.670]
My lawyer says it's worth white hair.

[00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:21.030]
A song.

[00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:25.030]
The side been looking around.

[00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:30.750]
One excuse to explain my world.

[00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:36.930]
You can't recognize me.

[00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:44.190]
My doctor is how I bleach dogs my epilithelies.

[00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:48.390]
And I keep the children around.

[00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:55.410]
And they sleep inside my bed.

[00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:02.430]
And he's a save that I am gay.

[00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:08.370]
That's why I'm marrying with a movie.

[00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:13.890]
It's way too late to come and say

[00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:16.370]
with this song.

[00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:21.590]
That's really bad.

[00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:32.250]
Blame it on my child's nose.

[00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:32.430]
No.

[00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:38.390]
I'm done with those toys that I never had.

[00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:42.590]
The only thing I show in my life

[00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:47.390]
is what my phone and I view it down.

[00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:56.130]
Before you judge me

[00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:59.670]
and hold me freaking,

[00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:04.590]
let me find and tell you.

[00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:06.390]
And say.

[00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:19.770]
I believe it on my child's nose.

[00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:21.730]
The devil made it through.

[00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:22.650]
No.

[00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:25.290]
177 and 560 WQM.

[00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:28.210]
Don't forget we're going to be a 7QM fan out there to have an tour.

[00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:29.550]
Do you say have an tour?

[00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:31.070]
Oh God.

[00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:32.830]
Anyway, we'll let you know as soon as they get there.

[00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.810]
Maybe we'll raise a few more bucks today for a center one.

[00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:37.270]
122,074 coming in.

[00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:38.190]
Hey Goldberg show.

[00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.970]
Cut off at two o'clock.

[00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:41.030]
Hank with the coach on the Jimmy Johnson show.

[00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:42.830]
5 this afternoon here on QAM.

[00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:49.990]
The Neil Roger show now on 560 WQM Miami Fort Lauderdale.

[00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:00.890]
Did I expect delay?

[00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:12.390]
Yes.

[00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:17.130]
Oh my god, it's not the better that you see.

[00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:21.390]
You're gonna have to have a walk and start the battle.

[00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:22.650]
I expect delay.

[00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:27.770]
And you're gonna have to eat it and let's just have to save all that's left.

[00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:30.870]
Just go to your nose and go to sleep.

[00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:32.270]
That's one for real.

[00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:33.850]
I'm sweating away.

[00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:48.110]
Don't I fight?

[00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:49.390]
Feel I die?

[00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:52.290]
I'm still fucking in just life.

[00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:54.790]
I'm doing you all that I did.

[00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:56.230]
Just in seven.

[00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:57.890]
I just doubt it.

[00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:59.890]
This is not a love thing.

[00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:03.770]
I knew maybe I should go to number two.

[00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:07.570]
It's not safe in here till I go to food.

[00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:09.010]
I got to lay.

[00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:23.930]
Vincent Baalke was a savior.

[00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:26.670]
Now he starts to feel the pressure.

[00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:29.350]
You can't read the Republican one.

[00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:30.730]
I find the change.

[00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:32.570]
And it's done.

[00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:37.590]
Run the house like a fan's word.

[00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:40.270]
And the Democrats may change no good.

[00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:44.710]
But your god, male, thought his mom she was on top of Trump.

[00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:46.650]
She said that news.

[00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:49.570]
Call Hillary down.

[00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:53.090]
When we call her the big beast,

[00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:54.910]
she don't mean bashful hockey.

[00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:57.130]
But we see God the bear of the devil.

[00:50:57.450 --> 00:50:59.410]
How about the pain from the show?

[00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:00.010]
God is.

[00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:04.830]
I'm no the new district loves this power.

[00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:12.250]
Don't shine.

[00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:14.110]
It got a secret for centuries.

[00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:15.070]
Don't shine.

[00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:16.490]
Now it can be all y'all.

[00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:17.430]
Don't shine.

[00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:19.550]
Did you ever wonder how something like that would happen?

[00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:39.590]
I don't know.

[00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:39.670]
I don't know.

[00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.670]

[00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.670]

[00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.730]
I don't know.

[00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:39.730]

[00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:39.730]

[00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:39.730]

[00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:39.730]

[00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:39.730]

[00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:39.730]

[00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:39.730]

[00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:39.730]

[00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:39.730]

[00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:39.730]

[00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:39.730]

[00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:39.810]
I don't know.

[00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.270]
I don't know.

[00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:40.430]
I don't know.

[00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.430]

[00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.770]
I don't know.

[00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:41.010]
I don't know.

[00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:41.250]
I don't know.

[00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.890]
I don't know.

[00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:42.850]
I don't know.

[00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:45.770]
I don't know.

[00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:46.470]
I don't know.

[00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.830]
I don't know.

[00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:49.530]
I don't know.

[00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:58.210]
I don't know.

[00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:04.790]
I don't know.

[00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:07.890]
I don't know.

[00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:09.010]
I don't know.

[00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:10.230]
I don't know.

[00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:11.390]
I don't know.

[00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.910]
I don't know.

[00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:12.590]
I don't know.

[00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:13.310]
I don't know.

[00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:16.990]
I don't know.

[00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:17.050]
I don't know.

[00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:19.510]
There's a19 million people on earth.

[00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.510]

[00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.510]

[00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.510]

[00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.510]

[00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:23.010]
I really, it's true, you stay all

[00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:27.470]
You want some gas, grab the fly

[00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:30.990]
All along the camera, the guy who's staying

[00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:36.250]
When you feel in your face

[00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:40.110]
Remember who you should stay, you stay all

[00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:46.070]
Leave the flat, wipe this crap off the mat

[00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:50.070]
You say you hurt

[00:52:56.090 --> 00:53:04.690]
Or wipe this cowl and then it damage the town you say

[00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:10.250]
Took your show off the road and got everybody to be able to say

[00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:19.030]
Now he's getting his news for God and everyone's blue who's insane

[00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:27.730]
Figure he and his mate sure hope he likes the blockade you say

[00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:34.330]
Leave the flat, wipe this crap off the mat

[00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:36.410]
Oh, who's there

[00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:42.970]
Leave the flat, wipe this crap off the mat

[00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:45.170]
Who's there

[00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:50.930]
It's a shame you're still alive

[00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:52.410]
Hold it like that

[00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:53.710]
Who's there

[00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:59.630]
You say you hurt

[00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:12.690]
When you got on the airplane

[00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:17.510]
The drink started right away

[00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:25.170]
Couple vodka, for them some tonic and tanky rain

[00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:27.130]
Start to eat, start to walk

[00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:32.650]
Start to act in the spirit

[00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:37.370]
Like happy jack the cow

[00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:45.230]
You pulled your zinger and the tail came a tongue then down

[00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:52.610]
When you climb on the cart

[00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:56.670]
The drink started with

[00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.770]
Then you do do

[00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:05.050]
In front of the saw

[00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:09.490]
Or on don't you know that

[00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:12.670]
It's a pattern that was occupied

[00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:17.790]
One of us was never sorry

[00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:22.370]
To keep you from do doing

[00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:30.270]
And now here's Kimmy Dean, founder of Kimmy Dean Fork's

[00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:33.650]
Sausage with a few words about new Kimmy Dean Bagel sandwiches

[00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:35.470]
Hello, I'm Kimmy Dean

[00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:39.930]
You know, he's been when it told me 25 years ago that I'd be making bagels

[00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:41.250]
I'd have said, huh?

[00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:43.350]
That's Jew food isn't it?

[00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:46.610]
But times have changed and I guess I've got to change with them

[00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:48.190]
But I don't have to like it

[00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:51.250]
You people want your bagels, I'll give you your bagels

[00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:54.990]
Well the bagel grease this lab at Kimmy Dean Fork's Sausage on it

[00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:58.010]
New Kimmy Dean non-coachier bagel sandwiches

[00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:59.990]
And your Jewish you can buy him

[00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:01.230]
You just can't eat him

[00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:03.070]
New Kimmy Dean Bagel sandwiches

[00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:05.350]
There's a little bit of bigger in everybody

[00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:10.370]
They're those almost those happy seniors

[00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:14.250]
They will jump with your happy when you come to their back door

[00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:18.010]
They're at those, almost the hated by the poor

[00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:21.470]
They met the deal on a family jet for the store

[00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:23.090]
It's so cool!

[00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:26.270]
So most absolutely no, it's me and no

[00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:34.550]
It's me, it's me, it's me

[00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:41.510]
It's me, it's me, it's me

[00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:43.830]
It's me, it's me, it's me

[00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:47.070]
It's me, it's me, it's me

[00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:49.010]
It's me, it's me

[00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:54.450]
It's me?

[00:56:58.070 --> 00:56:59.070]
It's me?

[00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:01.070]
It's me?

[00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.790]
No

[00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:04.190]
No?

[00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:06.770]
It's me

[00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:13.450]
They're those almost those happy seniors

[00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:17.270]
They will jump with your happy when you come to their back door

[00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:20.890]
They're those almost they hope you come again

[00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:24.890]
The few mutual letters when they see you in the end

[00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:27.170]
It's like I waited five, six, you'd WQA

[00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:29.390]
But you're a happy holiday station here for the 90s

[00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:31.930]
And we're just doing a baby right till two o'clock

[00:57:31.930 --> 00:57:34.290]
Don't waste your time with the phone calls because we're not even answering them anymore

[00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:38.630]
Why should we, you know, why should we burden the audience with the burden of...

[00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:39.090]
They stopped!

[00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:39.470]
That's right

[00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:45.550]
So we'll just continue playing great stuff including stuff you haven't heard in a coon's age here today from now until two o'clock and enjoy

[00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:48.550]
But we will let you know where the Q&A van is going to be as soon as we find out

[00:57:48.550 --> 00:57:49.290]
We found out yet?

[00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:49.610]
No!

[00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:50.770]
But we're working on it

[00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:53.750]
Audience is loved now

[00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:58.830]
The story of a girl who developed her own strange language while being raised by a stork-y paired mother

[00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:04.170]
Now, Jody Foster returns to the screen as a girl raised by a deaf mute epileptic

[00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:08.750]
Who has learned to communicate by making unintelligible noises and her language self to the ground

[00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:11.810]
Look down here, I think the girl is trying to communicate with us

[00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:12.010]
Oh!

[00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:13.590]
You're hungry

[00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:15.370]
You're sleepy

[00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:17.530]
You want to lie down

[00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:20.630]
You want to lie down repeated like that

[00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:25.890]
Watch as this pre-spirited strong-willed girl learns to express joy

[00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:27.530]
Anger

[00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.630]
Curiosity

[00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:32.130]
Even love

[00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:35.550]
Jody Foster stars in fell

[00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:38.610]
The runaway hit that his audience is falling out of their seat

[00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:41.570]
Fell, it's a real pic near

[00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:49.790]
In France, it is said there is a certain recipe that one must follow in order to enjoy life to its fullest

[00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:54.630]
Good friends, good food, and plenty of this

[00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:55.750]
Duce

[00:58:56.730 --> 00:58:57.330]
Duce

[00:58:58.810 --> 00:58:59.410]
Duce

[00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:00.310]
Duce

[00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:06.170]
The vinegar and mineral water beverage that's been France's best kept secret for over 500 years

[00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:09.210]
Duce, now available in the United States

[00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:11.650]
You loved him as a Frazier on Cheers

[00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:14.750]
You cherished him as a Frazier on Frazier

[00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:22.050]
Now, 17 times any winning and 38 times Betty Ford residing Chelsea Grammar is delving into uncharted territory

[00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:24.610]
With Chelsea Grammar things very white

[00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:30.770]
If you don't mind my saying so, I feel that your love far exceeds that which I can get enough of

[00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:34.290]
Or so it's not a concluded by fault with the preposition as it were

[00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:38.530]
Of your love, I cannot get enough

[00:59:38.530 --> 00:59:42.910]
Not since William Sanders losing the sky with diamonds and Pat Boone's tutti fruity

[00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:50.710]
Had there been such a torrid juxtaposition of an Anglo-oriented song stylist interpreting otherwise enjoyable, hopeful melodic renderings

[00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:57.150]
Pardon me, ma'am, but when would be your convenient time for your knives to get it on?

[00:59:57.630 --> 01:00:00.470]
Oh, yeah, my mojo is working

[01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:02.330]
I think I think it is

[01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:05.610]
Plus, if you act now, we'll throw in at some additional charge

[01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:09.910]
A free bonus track of Mr. Grammar's stirring windation of Isaac Hayes, shout

[01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:16.970]
Would you happen to be privy to the knowledge of who that African American detective is for whom many of young ladies have

[01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:21.230]
Emmer's feelings, oh, yeah, you're done

[01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:24.990]
So, get Chelsea Grammar things very white

[01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:27.550]
He makes very white, very white

[01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:32.270]
Oh, I really got my book of work and now, ma'am, watch me work

[01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:39.690]
12 after 11 at 5.60 WQM, so the QAM van is located at the Evan Turah

[01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:44.530]
Yeah, the Evan Turah mall right between JC Penney's and Lord and Taylor, as he said, right by Eastside Marios

[01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:47.270]
Right in front of Eastside Marios, there's a main entrance there

[01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:50.250]
Yeah, facing the disc game

[01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:55.170]
Right, and they're there right now and they got the best of Neil of volumes one and two

[01:00:55.170 --> 01:00:59.410]
And the parts that haven't been invented yet, they got CDs, they got cassettes, they got Neil T-shirts

[01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:02.750]
And that's what they got, so stop by 122,074

[01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:06.670]
We can get real close to 125 today, real close to 123

[01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:09.810]
So I'm on the phone with my stiff mother when I call waiting clicks

[01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:12.910]
And of course, I say to myself, thank God, saved by the bill

[01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:18.010]
I pick up and it's a representative from Downs Southern Bell wanting me to switch from AT&T to Downs Southern

[01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:22.390]
I asked him, what can Downs Southern give me that I'm not already getting from AT&T?

[01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:27.130]
He said, well, if you switch now, I won't send my brother Jimmy Joe to your house to rape your food

[01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:30.430]
I told him he was out of line and I'm not switching from AT&T

[01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:33.030]
He said, I'm walking you from the house across the street

[01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:37.410]
And I told him I was going to call the cops at that point and he said, get in and get me Joe

[01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:41.870]
And before I know it, there's a crash at my front door and this pick runs into my bedroom

[01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:47.750]
He says like, grandpa Jones, you know from he-haw, he told me to take my pants off and squeeze like a pig

[01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:50.690]
Then this brother comes in with nothing on the stock

[01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:55.790]
And at this point, on Southern Bell, I'm only eating just the fact that the widow's eating just starting to fly

[01:01:57.050 --> 01:02:01.410]
Hey guys, if you're getting married this June, are you concerned about your wedding night?

[01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:03.890]
Oh honey, would you mind?

[01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:07.030]
I'd be glad to, Wilbur, if I could find it

[01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:23.110]
No.

[01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:24.150]

I'm fine.

[01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:38.230]
Thank you.

[01:15:44.130 --> 01:15:45.010]
I'm fine.

[01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:45.010]

[01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:45.010]

[01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:45.010]

[01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:45.010]

[01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:45.010]

[01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:47.530]
less hair than you have today. How do you explain that?

[01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:49.190]
I don't wear a wig, sir.

[01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:50.290]
Paint your bald spot.

[01:15:50.710 --> 01:15:51.470]
Work bald spot.

[01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:52.890]
You paint your bald spot?

[01:15:54.130 --> 01:15:56.230]
Oh, you're talking about sir. My hair grows.

[01:15:56.890 --> 01:15:57.930]
You paint your bald spot.

[01:15:58.230 --> 01:15:59.250]
I don't have a bald spot.

[01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:01.450]
How come you had less hair on the tape?

[01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:05.070]
Maybe my hair grew. Maybe I had a bad haircut that day.

[01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:06.310]
You're probably the way something.

[01:16:06.970 --> 01:16:07.570]
What do you care?

[01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:09.570]
Paint your bald spot?

[01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:11.550]
I don't. Do you paint your bald spot?

[01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:12.830]
Paint your bald spot?

[01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:18.110]
I'm having a difficult time logging on to your favorite online service provider.

[01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:20.910]
Unable to call, even to complain.

[01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:25.190]
Why not take the road less travels than the information superhighway?

[01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:28.690]
Take the backcountry road with Earl's Internet Service.

[01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:33.010]
It's faster than a 74GTO with a 354-bowl.

[01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:36.910]
Hey, I'm just wearing a golden forest.

[01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:38.730]
Hey, I'm just wearing a golden forest.

[01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:46.030]
At Earl's, we know that you not only need speedy access to the web,

[01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:48.190]
but you also want the view for pornography.

[01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:51.030]
And don't worry about any parental controls with us.

[01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:52.390]
Good old-ware-o is justice.

[01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:53.390]
Hortie is you.

[01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:55.390]
That's Earl's Internet.

[01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:57.750]
We're not just a paper cup on a string.

[01:16:58.150 --> 01:17:01.150]
We're a half a million paper cups on a half a million strings.

[01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:06.610]
The sign up today just been all Mr. Hopkins and Colin Burst just passed the Wittigringes

[01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:08.390]
up the road by the Dead Squirrel.

[01:17:08.610 --> 01:17:09.390]
You can't miss it.

[01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:10.170]
Earl's Internet.

[01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:13.230]
The backcountry road to the information superhighway.

[01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:35.570]
When did you went down the bank of South?

[01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:41.850]
Finding a great head of CTL when it's just a lonely day.

[01:17:42.210 --> 01:17:46.590]
The family's gone away because they couldn't give her every play.

[01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:51.350]
Just any preaches, Ben's just timing J.

[01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:52.310]
Oh, buddy, shoot it.

[01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:55.550]
Get up all the business because he's getting nailed.

[01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:57.890]
This is aspirational golf.

[01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:59.770]
His family's moving on.

[01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:02.610]
Yes, she's looking for the wider play.

[01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:07.930]
They used to think that it was so easy.

[01:18:09.130 --> 01:18:12.030]
This purple cash was having faith in his dreams.

[01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:14.070]
How he's clients.

[01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:17.010]
She is firing now.

[01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:24.150]
Once the weekend lets you be happy.

[01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:28.390]
For family faces you may love throughout the week.

[01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:32.190]
So she's fired when it's while he's flying.

[01:18:32.290 --> 01:18:33.890]
And now he's his.

[01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:36.690]
He didn't know her G spot on the club's hands.

[01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:07.310]
I was doing this monkey with his ass all right.

[01:19:07.570 --> 01:19:10.530]
And in just three days he was noted in debt.

[01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:12.430]
It was a full hour.

[01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:15.110]
It's a full hour.

[01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:20.610]
Making love to a monkey with it just ain't right.

[01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:23.650]
Now my face is sweaty and my butt cheeks.

[01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:24.790]
Guys, it's busy.

[01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:25.790]
Boala.

[01:19:26.190 --> 01:19:27.270]
Oh, people.

[01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:29.170]
Boala.

[01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.670]
People.

[01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:32.490]
Boala.

[01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:43.330]
I don't know the fucking over.

[01:19:43.650 --> 01:19:47.770]
I can't go to bring you to a fair and trust in my risk.

[01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:54.590]
I'm on the ground.

[01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:57.250]
I'll stay with that girl.

[01:19:57.970 --> 01:19:59.130]
The end is you.

[01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:02.970]
You're just the worst thing this is Boala.

[01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:03.810]
Who?

[01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:04.490]
People.

[01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:05.430]
Boala.

[01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:07.870]
People.

[01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:09.150]
Boala.

[01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:09.770]

[01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:09.770]

[01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:21.670]
I know the fucking over is right here.

[01:20:21.970 --> 01:20:25.050]
Go to bring you to the fair and trust in my risk.

[01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:28.290]
I'm driving so to fair, kick and ground.

[01:20:28.710 --> 01:20:31.770]
Go to the show, yes, till I'm on the ground.

[01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:33.490]
I'll stop the fun.

[01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:34.470]
It's been a little bit too much.

[01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:37.930]
I know what's the big, so for a monkey.

[01:20:37.930 --> 01:21:07.910]
I know what's the big, so for a monkey.

[01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.910]

Hey, minutes afternoon at 560, WQM, Merry Christmas, Gappy New Year, and all other good stuff.

[01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:33.190]
We're kicking some serious ads over there in Evans' Hero, aren't we?

[01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:33.450]
No.

[01:46:33.650 --> 01:46:35.570]
280 bucks, how much is it over 300 by now?

[01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:36.770]
Anybody believe it's over 300?

[01:46:36.850 --> 01:46:37.010]
No.

[01:46:37.130 --> 01:46:39.450]
It could be. We'll be getting report any second now any moment.

[01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:49.930]
Well, right there at the main entrance, we got the QAM van right by the main God Damned Entrance there in Evans' Hero Mall, right by East Side Mirios, between pennies and the Lurden Tether and all those other glitzy stores.

[01:46:49.930 --> 01:46:54.350]
We just look for Chris and Sam and all those people and say, hey, here's a bunch of money.

[01:46:54.530 --> 01:46:56.330]
We're going to try the end of the butt, honey.

[01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:08.890]
We're down in Jamaica in the South of Beane.

[01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:11.830]
They got the best birth that you ever.

[01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.810]
Yes.

[01:47:12.810 --> 01:47:20.030]
As anybody in that neighborhood, they tell you this country where they're gonna be put.

[01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.870]
Yeah.

[01:47:21.230 --> 01:47:28.510]
Just a man has some he want to sell and from a mile away, you can detect these smell of smoke.

[01:47:30.150 --> 01:47:32.290]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:47:33.690 --> 01:47:36.030]
He light up this cliff and smoke.

[01:47:36.370 --> 01:47:36.630]
Oh!

[01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:39.810]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:47:39.810 --> 01:47:43.770]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:47:45.650 --> 01:47:47.450]
The gun to be good.

[01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:53.950]
We'll be carrying lots of earth in the gunny sack.

[01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:58.410]
Smoke it every day until your lungs run like a rock.

[01:47:58.770 --> 01:48:05.510]
With all the money that we have made, Jamaica doesn't need any foreign aid.

[01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:12.570]
American tourists come here and say, got nothing like this in the USA.

[01:48:13.210 --> 01:48:13.850]
They smoke.

[01:48:14.450 --> 01:48:17.670]
Are you smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:48:18.970 --> 01:48:21.450]
They light up this cliff and smoke.

[01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:25.170]
They begin to puff and choke.

[01:48:26.890 --> 01:48:28.950]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:48:31.210 --> 01:48:33.230]
The gun to be good.

[01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:39.410]
I'm a bell for son, you are a rock star man.

[01:48:40.190 --> 01:48:43.210]
You like this wolf, the giant stiff whenever you turn.

[01:48:43.970 --> 01:48:46.950]
Many people coming here for miles around.

[01:48:47.690 --> 01:48:50.730]
So bite and hurtful you by the ounce and it comes.

[01:48:51.670 --> 01:48:54.570]
Rock the man, say to her, mama, you're right.

[01:48:54.570 --> 01:48:56.510]
They can't be good.

[01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:59.170]
The night ends and they smoke.

[01:48:59.850 --> 01:49:00.730]
They can't be good.

[01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:02.950]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:49:04.230 --> 01:49:06.750]
They light up this cliff and smoke.

[01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:08.090]
Oh, we're fine.

[01:49:08.650 --> 01:49:10.570]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:49:12.230 --> 01:49:14.250]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:18.870]
They can't be good.

[01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:23.270]
Come on.

[01:49:26.610 --> 01:49:29.890]
M.T.I.S calling circle plan has proven to be so popular.

[01:49:30.170 --> 01:49:32.850]
We've introduced a new kind of long distance calling circle.

[01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:34.270]
Hello.

[01:49:34.490 --> 01:49:34.950]
Hello, Ted.

[01:49:35.150 --> 01:49:35.830]
Hi, Dave. What's up?

[01:49:35.970 --> 01:49:37.890]
I've set up a conference call with you, Donald.

[01:49:38.110 --> 01:49:38.510]
Just do you.

[01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:39.050]
There you guys.

[01:49:39.250 --> 01:49:39.610]
I'm here.

[01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:40.130]
Me too.

[01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:42.070]
Okay, everybody got this month's playboy.

[01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:43.510]
I got it right here.

[01:49:43.890 --> 01:49:45.750]
Okay, everybody turn to page 78.

[01:49:47.330 --> 01:49:48.750]
Wow, he's really pretty.

[01:49:49.110 --> 01:49:49.530]
Very good, huh?

[01:49:49.710 --> 01:49:51.990]
With M.T.I.S new long distance calling plan,

[01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:54.750]
you can share a special moment with your friends anytime.

[01:49:55.170 --> 01:49:56.430]
And save money while you do it.

[01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:59.070]
That was great.

[01:49:59.290 --> 01:50:01.950]
And we say 45 cents over the regular long distance plan.

[01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:05.110]
Introducing the calling circle jerk from M.T.I.

[01:50:05.310 --> 01:50:08.770]
The calling circle jerk, a new way to keep you in touch with others.

[01:50:09.170 --> 01:50:09.770]
Answer to that.

[01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:12.290]
It's my little girl.

[01:50:12.890 --> 01:50:15.310]
I was so proud when I got.

[01:50:15.890 --> 01:50:17.670]
I was so proud when I got.

[01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:20.690]
It's me who's been to black and white, she's so funny.

[01:50:21.490 --> 01:50:23.170]
I'll tell you what's my heart.

[01:50:23.410 --> 01:50:26.430]
That's the call that's going to have a hole in the trunk.

[01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:28.150]
And the distance is a door.

[01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:31.770]
And you can see the road through the hole in the floor.

[01:50:32.190 --> 01:50:33.170]
It's my little girl.

[01:50:33.490 --> 01:50:36.170]
I was so proud when I got.

[01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:38.730]
I was so proud when I got.

[01:50:38.730 --> 01:50:40.950]
It's me who can roll and win.

[01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:42.170]
One has to lay.

[01:50:42.890 --> 01:50:45.850]
So when it gets started, choose my rights.

[01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:49.410]
I just need to take down to those normal two sticks.

[01:50:49.850 --> 01:50:51.530]
Because stuff's not even failing wire.

[01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:52.650]
That's the trick.

[01:50:53.150 --> 01:50:54.290]
It's my little girl.

[01:50:55.730 --> 01:50:57.170]
I was so proud when I got.

[01:50:58.730 --> 01:50:59.750]
That's the problem that I got.

[01:51:00.230 --> 01:51:03.310]
I never knew how to drive a car these four.

[01:51:03.610 --> 01:51:06.790]
But they handed me the keys when I got too short.

[01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:10.210]
And then they needed up to make the really split.

[01:51:10.730 --> 01:51:12.090]
That's one more thing.

[01:51:12.370 --> 01:51:14.030]
I got no play, Connie.

[01:51:14.490 --> 01:51:17.290]
It feels like we're on the rainy day.

[01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:20.850]
But the tape on the window needs to work okay.

[01:51:21.450 --> 01:51:24.410]
The front wheels start to shake when I try to steer.

[01:51:25.110 --> 01:51:27.730]
And I can't take this out of second gear.

[01:51:28.210 --> 01:51:29.350]
It's my little girl.

[01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:32.270]
I'm so proud when I got.

[01:51:34.910 --> 01:51:36.410]
It's my little girl.

[01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:39.610]
I'm so proud when I got.

[01:51:41.810 --> 01:51:43.250]
It's my little girl.

[01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.630]
It's my little girl.

[01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:43.650]
Cool.

[01:51:50.610 --> 01:51:53.730]
She was an intern for the president.

[01:51:54.670 --> 01:51:57.230]
Early on, she wasn't sure what it meant.

[01:51:57.490 --> 01:51:59.570]
But he would show her.

[01:52:00.110 --> 01:52:01.370]
She should show her.

[01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:07.570]
She took her on a tour of the over place.

[01:52:07.810 --> 01:52:10.710]
And when they were through, we held a biopace.

[01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:12.070]
And he said no.

[01:52:13.410 --> 01:52:15.990]
No, no, no, no.

[01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:18.990]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:52:18.990 --> 01:52:20.050]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:52:20.050 --> 01:52:31.350]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:34.470]
She bound to a knee and then she swallowing it down.

[01:52:34.730 --> 01:52:35.910]
And he said slow.

[01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:38.870]
Let's just let's slow.

[01:52:40.090 --> 01:52:40.470]
Oh.

[01:52:41.110 --> 01:52:44.630]
Well, it wasn't long before his bubble burst.

[01:52:45.130 --> 01:52:47.910]
And the little intern had a terrible burst.

[01:52:48.170 --> 01:52:49.270]
He was a slow.

[01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:52.410]
Let's just slow.

[01:52:53.890 --> 01:52:55.690]
Let's just slow.

[01:52:55.690 --> 01:52:56.910]
Oh, man.

[01:52:56.910 --> 01:52:56.910]

[01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:04.510]
Oh, man.

[01:53:04.890 --> 01:53:08.390]
Well, she taped conversations on the phone.

[01:53:09.010 --> 01:53:11.550]
Choking about a billy phone.

[01:53:12.130 --> 01:53:15.010]
And when it came, it had it in it's head.

[01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:18.330]
She said feeling fine, gonna take a step.

[01:53:18.970 --> 01:53:21.750]
I'm not the world's most curious man.

[01:53:22.090 --> 01:53:23.450]
But for what I hear,

[01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:27.090]
I understand she was a go-ah.

[01:53:27.450 --> 01:53:29.250]
Oh, cuckoo cuckoo.

[01:53:29.550 --> 01:53:30.450]
Oh, wow.

[01:53:31.190 --> 01:53:32.530]
Cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo.

[01:53:32.850 --> 01:53:37.290]
Oh, wow.

[01:53:38.150 --> 01:53:38.970]
Oh, wow.

[01:53:38.970 --> 01:53:40.650]
Slow, wow.

[01:53:42.270 --> 01:53:44.030]
Slow, wow.

[01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:47.390]
Slow, wow.

[01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:50.690]
Go-ah.

[01:53:51.770 --> 01:53:53.430]
Little-oh.

[01:53:57.130 --> 01:53:58.410]
Little-oh.

[01:53:58.410 --> 01:53:59.270]
Little-oh.

[01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:07.250]
Little-oh.

[01:54:07.330 --> 01:54:07.330]

[01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:13.210]
She looks like a guy.

[01:54:14.590 --> 01:54:16.790]
She's 70 wide.

[01:54:17.890 --> 01:54:21.510]
She makes me want to touch rise.

[01:54:21.690 --> 01:54:27.070]
A chick with a dick.

[01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:30.870]
With two smelly jins.

[01:54:31.930 --> 01:54:34.950]
A loaded and ugly fat dick.

[01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:36.530]
That's how I feel.

[01:54:38.970 --> 01:54:42.070]
She wants a media to stop us using.

[01:54:42.890 --> 01:54:45.630]
Everything heard and asked with songs like this.

[01:54:46.570 --> 01:54:49.190]
But we find that all using.

[01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:52.250]
From that self-promoting of we do.

[01:54:54.650 --> 01:54:56.530]
How much were you paid?

[01:54:57.070 --> 01:54:58.410]
How much were you paid?

[01:54:59.030 --> 01:55:00.210]
Foremanica's paid.

[01:55:00.930 --> 01:55:02.950]
Foremanica's paid.

[01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:06.550]
Foremanica's paid.

[01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:07.230]
Foremanica's paid.

[01:55:11.190 --> 01:55:18.350]
Euple an Ruenges Road and this is what it meant to mean.

[01:55:18.370 --> 01:55:20.270]
But I mean to feed me the street simply because of the lounge design in Augusta City,

[01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.270]

[01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.490]
Yeap.

[01:55:20.490 --> 01:55:20.650]
Wananjus.

[01:55:20.930 --> 01:55:21.290]
You live in a Westhold?

[01:55:21.290 --> 01:55:21.310]
Or your auntie comes here with flowers?

[01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:23.210]
These strawberries will feed.

[01:55:23.210 --> 01:55:23.210]

[01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:32.250]
Ryujii ведts u a friend.

[01:55:32.250 --> 01:55:37.250]
I ran with my assists

[01:55:46.270 --> 01:55:50.250]
Farads caught, farads caught

[01:55:56.250 --> 01:55:59.970]
Farads caught, farads caught

[01:56:02.170 --> 01:56:03.850]
What did he send me?

[01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:05.510]
Or did he send?

[01:56:06.570 --> 01:56:07.370]
Did you swallow?

[01:56:07.870 --> 01:56:09.270]
Or did you spit?

[01:56:10.230 --> 01:56:13.610]
Did he tissue a number to wait on line?

[01:56:14.110 --> 01:56:15.450]
All the people you care?

[01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:22.070]
You go, say, come back to the other one, this guy's hand.

[01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:27.590]
Your conversation with him on the phone

[01:56:27.590 --> 01:56:33.630]
For a fine you can start with a stiffer and harder and best of gay jokes

[01:56:33.630 --> 01:56:36.610]
All the stuff, all the stuff

[01:56:36.610 --> 01:56:39.530]
What sometimes do you wish girl like you?

[01:56:41.070 --> 01:56:44.270]
All the stuff, all the stuff

[01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:47.950]
Wearing a dress with present-doos

[01:56:47.950 --> 01:56:47.950]

[01:56:48.590 --> 01:56:52.110]
Did you feel silly and where you served right?

[01:56:52.110 --> 01:56:56.330]
Do you find that really was done circus on size?

[01:56:56.610 --> 01:57:00.090]
With the chorino, cheese and the Chinese bread

[01:57:00.090 --> 01:57:03.430]
On the phone, on the phone

[01:57:04.110 --> 01:57:07.910]
On the phone, on the phone

[01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:12.690]
On the phone, on the phone

[01:57:12.690 --> 01:57:14.550]
What's the night's kiss?

[01:57:15.090 --> 01:57:15.670]
Night's kiss?

[01:57:16.690 --> 01:57:19.510]
Saying it's a busy, busy, busy, busy, busy

[01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:21.350]
Now it's a night's kiss

[01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:22.390]
Night's kiss

[01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:30.070]
Saying it's a busy, busy, busy, busy, busy

[01:57:30.070 --> 01:57:40.810]
Thatañ Gase They're trying to make the same pie

[01:57:40.810 --> 01:57:42.050]
Their palette's a nobody

[01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:43.150]
I've done a lot Now I've done a lot

[01:57:43.150 --> 01:57:43.150]

[01:57:43.150 --> 01:57:43.150]

[01:57:43.150 --> 01:57:44.230]
Have a full night

[01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:45.990]

[01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:45.990]

[01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:45.990]

[01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:47.310]
Na lo what's your day, bW Approximately

[01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:48.510]
Hello

[01:57:48.490 --> 01:57:49.470]
What's the night?

[01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:51.310]
Can't lie to you.

[01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:54.570]
Spending time between the business.

[01:57:55.130 --> 01:57:58.590]
You're not writing up your whole family's time.

[01:57:59.210 --> 01:58:02.190]
But you can spend the most of that only with us.

[01:58:02.450 --> 01:58:02.990]
What's the night?

[01:58:03.190 --> 01:58:04.670]
Can't lie to you.

[01:58:05.710 --> 01:58:07.310]
Say it with the president.

[01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:08.710]
Oh, yeah!

[01:58:09.050 --> 01:58:10.750]
Now you can make millions of dollars,

[01:58:10.890 --> 01:58:12.110]
thank the bills, my Kate.

[01:58:12.590 --> 01:58:15.610]
The movie's in books with these across things on your face.

[01:58:15.610 --> 01:58:16.490]
What's the night?

[01:58:17.130 --> 01:58:18.610]
Can't lie to you.

[01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:20.890]
Say it with the president.

[01:58:21.370 --> 01:58:22.410]
Oh, no, please.

[01:58:23.090 --> 01:58:24.190]
Say it with the president.

[01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:25.530]
Oh, no, please.

[01:58:26.290 --> 01:58:27.470]
Say it with the president.

[01:58:28.110 --> 01:58:29.070]
You better slip.

[01:58:29.370 --> 01:58:30.710]
Hey, Niels, it's true.

[01:58:30.990 --> 01:58:33.930]
I can't have an orgasm just driving down I-95.

[01:58:34.590 --> 01:58:37.730]
But only if you're driving beside me.

[01:58:41.470 --> 01:58:43.150]
Can't start the battle,

[01:58:43.650 --> 01:58:45.410]
who doesn't know when to quit?

[01:58:46.050 --> 01:58:51.990]
And everyone finds where wondering who's the sad fool.

[01:58:57.790 --> 01:58:59.010]
I'll cause it,

[01:58:59.250 --> 01:59:00.410]
because it really doesn't matter.

[01:59:00.710 --> 01:59:02.150]
It will get off tonight,

[01:59:02.650 --> 01:59:04.370]
when it's the Christian night.

[01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:05.930]
Who can eat now?

[01:59:07.390 --> 01:59:09.490]
Hey, can the job ever die?

[01:59:09.730 --> 01:59:11.770]
It gets the hell out of us all right?

[01:59:11.890 --> 01:59:15.370]
Just go away and leave the dollar alone.

[01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:19.550]
It starts with an asshole who thinks I'm so much in quick.

[01:59:20.450 --> 01:59:22.370]
And it's really much funny today,

[01:59:22.610 --> 01:59:23.450]
what's the reason?

[01:59:24.150 --> 01:59:25.410]
Who does that fool?

[01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:31.570]
Can't have an asshole?

[01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:40.850]
I'm prosecuted for the fright.

[01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:44.730]
You're like a Nazi from the O- Third Reich.

[01:59:45.850 --> 01:59:48.470]
A flint in pain is to find anything

[01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:52.230]
like women who lie in and between.

[01:59:53.310 --> 01:59:55.210]
What's your problem, can he stop?

[01:59:56.910 --> 01:59:59.070]
Don't you think you got too far?

[02:00:00.730 --> 02:00:05.150]
Everybody think you are like Joseph McCarthy.

[02:00:05.690 --> 02:00:06.050]
Yes.

[02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:11.590]
Did you know that Joseph McCarthy was gay?

[02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:15.550]
What kind of life he can't accept he never bays?

[02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:19.290]
He kept right home, most by his side,

[02:00:19.770 --> 02:00:22.970]
until he got tired with broken ties.

[02:00:23.670 --> 02:00:25.890]
What's your problem, can he stop?

[02:00:25.890 --> 02:00:29.610]
If you mad at me, we're thorough as God.

[02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:35.770]
He would want to take you on like Joseph McCarthy.

[02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:39.430]
Weep, weep, weep, weep, boy.

[02:00:41.150 --> 02:00:43.250]
Weep, weep, weep, weep, boy.

[02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:46.490]
I love that bit and I love the Beatles.

[02:00:46.750 --> 02:00:48.730]
I just discovered what I hate about Beatles music.

[02:00:48.910 --> 02:00:52.290]
Too much of that Moroccan crap, too much of that baby crap.

[02:00:53.190 --> 02:00:54.130]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:00:54.330 --> 02:00:55.030]
That's where he goes fault.

[02:00:55.930 --> 02:00:57.590]
I'm about of course because he's not a musician

[02:00:57.590 --> 02:00:58.550]
and he couldn't do anything.

[02:00:58.670 --> 02:01:00.010]
He wasn't even a good drummer, but nevertheless,

[02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:01.410]
but he didn't have a big nose.

[02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:04.350]
Anyway, 25 past noon, Mary Christmas from your good,

[02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:06.770]
close personal friends at QAIM and from us as well.

[02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:09.170]
And we got no more updates from Aventura.

[02:01:09.250 --> 02:01:11.390]
Maybe they're getting some good phone numbers out there now, huh?

[02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:13.330]
We got a lot of those young ladies.

[02:01:14.190 --> 02:01:15.150]
Aventura, I'm a hundred.

[02:01:15.570 --> 02:01:16.670]
That's what I'm the age of a hundred.

[02:01:17.550 --> 02:01:18.970]
280 bucks was our last report.

[02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.870]
That's pretty weak.

[02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:26.790]
123,174 plus 280 is 123,354.

[02:01:28.490 --> 02:01:30.070]
So we're getting really right on the edge

[02:01:30.070 --> 02:01:31.970]
if we get some activity out there at Aventura.

[02:01:32.150 --> 02:01:33.550]
I think we're going to get some real serious...

[02:01:33.550 --> 02:01:33.690]
No!

[02:01:34.190 --> 02:01:36.350]
It's supposed to take a f***er and put it Jesus!

[02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:09.810]
I'm going to get some real serious stuff out there.

[02:02:09.810 --> 02:02:09.810]

[02:02:09.810 --> 02:02:09.810]

[02:02:09.810 --> 02:02:09.810]

[02:02:09.810 --> 02:02:09.830]
I'm going to get some real serious stuff out there.

[02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.870]
I'm going to get some real serious stuff out there.

[02:02:10.130 --> 02:02:10.130]

[02:02:10.210 --> 02:02:11.590]
I'm going to get some real serious stuff out there.

[02:02:12.010 --> 02:02:13.950]
I'm going to get some real serious stuff out there.

[02:02:14.190 --> 02:02:14.910]
I'm going to get some real serious stuff out there.

[02:02:14.910 --> 02:02:15.130]
I'm going to get some real serious stuff out there.

[02:02:15.130 --> 02:02:15.130]

[02:02:15.130 --> 02:02:15.130]

[02:02:15.130 --> 02:02:15.130]

[02:02:15.130 --> 02:02:28.450]
I'm going to get some real serious stuff out there.

[02:02:28.450 --> 02:02:28.450]

[02:02:28.450 --> 02:02:28.450]

[02:02:28.450 --> 02:02:28.630]
I'm going to get some real serious stuff out there.

[02:02:28.630 --> 02:02:28.770]
I'm going to get some real serious stuff out there.

[02:02:28.770 --> 02:02:28.890]
I'm going to get some real serious stuff out there.

[02:02:28.890 --> 02:02:31.010]
I'm going to get some real serious stuff out there.

Do you think I think I'm sick of this?

[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:21.080]
I've been home all those times

[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:22.220]

It was just a wonderful way.

[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:08.860]
Now how about you, Brian?

[02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:10.200]
Very small.

[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:12.040]
We kept it to a family affair.

[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:14.940]
Is this plane going from here to, uh, Trinity?

[02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:17.020]
Hey, I'll come your own way, Jack.

[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:17.920]
That is not Jacques.

[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:19.220]

I don't want to know about this.

[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:34.040]
I want to know about the Nisten Frank.

[02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:36.320]

[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:49.000]
But you know, the best part about the 70s was the hair.

[02:12:49.300 --> 02:12:49.860]
That's right.

[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:51.280]
People had great hair.

[02:12:51.460 --> 02:12:53.100]
And black people had the best hair of all.

[02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:53.840]
Afros.

[02:12:54.140 --> 02:12:54.380]
Right.

[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:54.960]
That's right.

[02:12:55.140 --> 02:12:57.080]
Like Florence Williams, the third on the mod squad.

[02:12:57.360 --> 02:12:58.740]
Sherman Helmsley on the Jefferson's.

[02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:00.400]
And pretty much anyone on Sanford and Sun.

[02:13:00.580 --> 02:13:01.240]
Yeah, Lamont.

[02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:02.500]
He had great hair.

[02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:05.900]
Well, nowadays 70s are back in style, including those great looking afro.

[02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:08.260]
Like Samuel L. Jackson's in public fiction.

[02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:09.780]
Now you can have hair just like here.

[02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:12.420]
Thanks to a revolutionary new product for the makers of Brogan.

[02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:14.440]

[02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:15.480]
I'm white.

[02:13:15.700 --> 02:13:16.080]

Even white guys like you.

[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:22.800]
Dino White.

[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:23.360]
Brogan.

[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:26.200]
Or bald middle-aged white guys who we say were young hip and black.

[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:29.180]
Coming this summer to a theater near you.

[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:32.480]
It started out as an innocent weekend rafting trip with the guys.

[02:13:36.860 --> 02:13:37.300]

Lucky pin over, it's going to be a lot of pain.

[02:13:56.020 --> 02:13:57.220]
You know, it's a bad hit.

[02:13:57.580 --> 02:13:59.460]
I said squeal, bad hit.

[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:00.880]

You 95.

[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:10.900]
We're so sorry.

[02:15:12.220 --> 02:15:14.020]
Davis, Rodman.

[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:20.740]
We don't stock in over ten days and takes a brief day.

[02:15:21.340 --> 02:15:22.860]
We're so sorry.

[02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:26.560]
Davis, Rodman.

[02:15:27.980 --> 02:15:31.320]
But the past is come with some ease,

[02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:33.440]
Feel the spirit of your innocence.

[02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:42.760]
The spills are chasing you to find me.

[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:44.080]
You said you'll find his indeed,

[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:45.220]
But you're dressing to the deep.

[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:46.540]
He asked if you would find

[02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:47.780]
There's something under his feet.

[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:48.800]
So, your way to call.

[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:50.260]
Way to call.

[02:15:50.700 --> 02:15:52.700]
Every time he jumps, you can see his basket fall.

[02:15:53.140 --> 02:15:53.440]
Whoa!

[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:57.180]
You have re-tarded, re-tarded,

[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:00.940]
For said, that is the talk of.

[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:06.960]
You have re-tarded, re-tarded,

[02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:10.740]
For said, that is the talk of.

[02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:15.700]
That is that is my stupid joke.

[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:19.240]
Now, we're about to take you to the town

[02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:21.140]
You want my little town.

[02:16:24.220 --> 02:16:26.540]
That is the talk of my stupid joke.

[02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:29.740]
Now, we're about to take you to the town.

[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:31.560]
We didn't let go of the town.

[02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:51.980]
You have re-tarded, re-tarded,

[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:55.640]
For said, that is the talk of.

[02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:01.660]
You have re-tarded, re-tarded,

[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:05.360]
For said, that is the talk of.

[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:18.600]
Forget the lifetime, channel.

[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:20.940]
And see these fat chicks.

[02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:23.180]
Never mind the cartoon network.

[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:24.640]
That kid stops.

[02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:25.700]
Screw MTV.

[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:27.240]
Where's the music?

[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:29.760]
Now, there's a channel just for men.

[02:17:31.020 --> 02:17:31.580]
Yeah.

[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.780]
Dick Allodian, hey guys, send the wife to the mall.

[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:38.200]
Put down the remote and kick back for all your favorites.

[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:39.560]
Like for a cunt.

[02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:40.840]
That is a real hug.

[02:17:41.180 --> 02:17:42.500]
Romance in the bones.

[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:47.580]
And Debbie does, well, everything but the kitchen sink.

[02:17:50.100 --> 02:17:53.000]
Dick Allodian, channel 69 on your box.

[02:17:53.460 --> 02:17:54.640]
Table box, that is.

[02:17:54.860 --> 02:17:56.900]
Call your local cable company for their Humphrey Special,

[02:17:57.060 --> 02:17:58.880]
More TV bang for your box on Dic at night.

[02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:02.500]
Dear Dad, I just finished my first week of boot camp.

[02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:03.320]
Hush it.

[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:04.200]
Hush it.

[02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:05.840]
It's tougher than I ever imagined.

[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:07.200]
Hush it.

[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:11.120]
But Sarge says that's what it takes to be a good soldier.

[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:13.740]
Today I learned about the Army's new donut,

[02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:16.440]
folks' health policy about homosexuals.

[02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:18.060]
Sarge asked me to bend over.

[02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:19.700]
The town, planet!

[02:18:20.220 --> 02:18:21.080]
I asked why.

[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:22.020]
Don't ask!

[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:23.740]
And don't shout!

[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:27.500]
Talk about a desirable discharge.

[02:18:27.940 --> 02:18:28.360]
Beep!

[02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:30.460]
All the girls, beep!

[02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:32.680]
And it's our life, it's the Army!

[02:18:40.820 --> 02:18:45.420]
You think that people want to fill your mouth with dirty love sauce?

[02:18:46.440 --> 02:18:53.160]
I look around me and I feel it is a soul.

[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:53.660]
No.

[02:18:54.220 --> 02:18:54.760]
Oh no.

[02:18:55.220 --> 02:18:55.400]
No.

[02:18:56.240 --> 02:19:01.300]
The boys would like to pave your hair in dirty love sauce.

[02:19:01.780 --> 02:19:02.000]
Yes.

[02:19:03.100 --> 02:19:06.020]
And once strong with that.

[02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:07.700]
Yes.

[02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:09.480]
We fight to know.

[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:11.180]
Okay.

[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:13.540]
But here we go.

[02:19:15.260 --> 02:19:16.160]
Again.

[02:19:18.840 --> 02:19:20.000]
Sports, sports.

[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:24.440]
To you.

[02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:29.960]
To you.

[02:19:31.780 --> 02:19:32.880]
To you.

[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:33.220]
Us.

[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:38.100]
Always much to learn.

[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:40.300]
It's really hard to see.

[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:42.220]
How can it be?

[02:19:43.220 --> 02:19:43.860]
Oh.

[02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:45.540]
What's wrong?

[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:47.160]
It's you!

[02:19:49.220 --> 02:19:50.040]
That's a bad old man.

[02:19:51.100 --> 02:19:51.440]
Oh.

[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:53.260]
What's wrong?

[02:19:55.080 --> 02:19:55.100]
Oh.

[02:19:57.080 --> 02:19:57.500]
No.

[02:19:57.500 --> 02:19:57.700]
No.

[02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:15.780]
When I can't make call me melanoma, I can't until I'm almost in a coma.

[02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:20.560]
How I eat my amy and I never ever use any sunscreen.

[02:20:21.100 --> 02:20:25.160]
Sun with me, tan with me, hope you don't mind I'm a little fructal.

[02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:29.660]
If I'm in a mess until we get melanoma, we think like a fine week of cell B aroma.

[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.420]
I like the raw ones but there's nobody on us.

[02:20:32.460 --> 02:20:32.680]
Hey!

[02:20:34.040 --> 02:20:38.860]
I spend all day at work planning that when I get off I go tanning.

[02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:41.680]
I get naked and fake naked.

[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.100]
How much longer is my skin gonna take it?

[02:20:44.460 --> 02:20:48.800]
My astrologist and your relatives have to help me find a dermatologist.

[02:20:48.980 --> 02:20:53.120]
If I'm in the sun until we get melanoma, we think like a fine week of cell B aroma.

[02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:57.760]
I like our all my amy and I never know my eye.

[02:20:58.180 --> 02:21:02.620]
We lie in the sun until we get melanoma, we think like a fine week of cell B aroma.

[02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:04.800]
We got lots of skin bigger than the best aroma.

[02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:05.620]
Hey!

[02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:07.280]
I never know my eye.

[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:09.120]
We don't care if we get melanoma.

[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:11.940]
We got the best tan from here to Arizona.

I wanna live where even you're gathered

[02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:16.120]

[02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:21.600]
Rain, I wanna go where the living is at

[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:23.700]
I wanna die

[02:23:23.700 --> 02:23:30.220]
I wanna live where even you're gathered

[02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:07.740]

Walt Disney Productions combined 60 years of parking master

[02:24:14.300 --> 02:24:16.740]
With two years of political ineptitude

[02:24:16.740 --> 02:24:19.580]
To give you a story we know all too well

[02:24:19.580 --> 02:24:21.300]
Now there's gonna be nifters

[02:24:21.300 --> 02:24:23.300]

With music by Elton John

Same old song and dance by Bill Clinton

[02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:31.320]
There was nothing to walk in my water

[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:33.340]
There are those in this show

[02:24:33.340 --> 02:24:35.500]
It's where they ought to pull the stones

[02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:38.300]
Bill Clinton is the lion king

[02:24:38.300 --> 02:24:40.920]
The sherry's supposed to plan he won't be on

[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:44.180]
But he never got in his arms

[02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:45.700]
The lion king

[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:48.740]
It's the story of love and power starting Bill Clinton

[02:24:48.740 --> 02:24:52.300]
It's his word against the entire world so who are you gonna believe?

[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:53.740]
It's the lion

[02:24:53.740 --> 02:24:55.660]

[02:25:06.820 --> 02:25:07.840]
Yes, Chinese

[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:11.200]
Okay, you can go to the middle of the road

[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:12.660]
So, you can go?

[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:12.940]
Go?

[02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:14.360]
I'll go to the other side

[02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:16.300]
I'll go to the other side

[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:17.360]
Go?

[02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:18.000]
Go

[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:18.620]
I'll go to the other side

[02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:20.040]
You're going to go to the other side

[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:21.820]
Okay, I'll go there and get the engine out

[02:25:21.820 --> 02:25:23.100]
Come over, I'll pick it up and look at the road

[02:25:23.700 --> 02:25:24.100]
Okay

[02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:25.580]
Okay, what's your name?

[02:25:25.580 --> 02:25:27.460]

[02:25:27.460 --> 02:25:28.360]
You know...

[02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:30.120]

[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:31.440]

You know,main emperor, right?

[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:32.700]
M-m-m-m- exclusitional

[02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:36.620]
Green black

[02:25:36.620 --> 02:25:36.880]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[02:25:39.140 --> 02:25:40.160]
Okay, I'll be right there.

[02:25:40.660 --> 02:25:41.720]
Okay, I'll go to the bathroom.

[02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:43.920]
I'll be right there.

[02:25:46.100 --> 02:25:49.140]
Okay, I'll be right there.

[02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:50.460]
Okay, we still have 400 bucks to the adventure.

[02:25:50.660 --> 02:25:51.860]
I'm sure we've got a lot more than that.

[02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:54.080]
Probably a lot more than two phone numbers.

[02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:55.900]
This is why it's taken so long to get the number.

[02:25:56.780 --> 02:25:58.440]
Don't forget the QAM fan is right there

[02:25:58.440 --> 02:25:59.620]
by the main entrance of the adventure.

[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:01.440]
Today they got the best meal for the holidays.

[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:03.020]
Last minute Christmas gift.

[02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:05.060]
A late Hanukkah gift that's never too late

[02:26:05.060 --> 02:26:05.840]
to spend the dreidel.

[02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:07.980]
And whatever else you want.

[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:09.660]
They're right there by what is the east side

[02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:12.460]
of Marios and between pennies and Lord and Taylor's, etc.

[02:26:12.780 --> 02:26:14.100]
Right by the main entrance of the adventure

[02:26:14.100 --> 02:26:16.220]
we're expecting you in gigantic bucks today.

[02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:17.120]
No, for center one.

[02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:18.060]
What's your idea?

[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:22.860]
Oh boy, it's the one to two hours.

[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:23.540]
Body.

[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:25.840]
I'll see you up with all the boys.

[02:26:27.220 --> 02:26:28.060]
I'm a Catholic.

[02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:29.180]
I'm a Catholic.

[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:37.120]
I'm a Catholic.

[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:38.880]
I'm a Catholic.

[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:38.880]

[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:38.880]

[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:42.120]
Once there was this nest.

[02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:44.960]
It's sticking hand under.

[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:48.280]
His arm makes it cut to 1,000 feet.

[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:55.440]
His tongue has been neat.

[02:26:55.440 --> 02:26:59.840]
Turn his eyes inside out.

[02:27:01.740 --> 02:27:07.020]
He drank a glass of milk from a straw stuck up through.

[02:27:14.340 --> 02:27:19.140]
He drank a glass of milk from a straw stuck up through.

[02:27:19.140 --> 02:27:21.040]
He drank a glass of milk from a straw stuck up through.

[02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:25.220]
Once there was this nest.

[02:27:26.180 --> 02:27:28.060]
It's stuck hand under.

[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:33.820]
He drank a glass of milk from a straw stuck up through.

[02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:37.000]
And whatever else you want.

[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:43.440]
There'd be a flow in upon the front lawn

[02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:53.820]
If the living he would be missed and forget had appeared

[02:27:53.820 --> 02:28:21.200]
There'd be a flow in upon the front lawn

[02:28:42.660 --> 02:28:53.720]
There'd be a flow in upon the front lawn

[02:29:03.740 --> 02:29:23.800]
There'd be a flow in upon the front lawn

[02:29:39.220 --> 02:29:41.240]
There'd be a flow in upon the front lawn

[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:43.560]
Did you fear your nephew was in hell?

[02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:49.780]
I feel that my nephew is not worth a long experience

[02:29:58.960 --> 02:29:59.820]
Not with the Lord, but in other words in hell

[02:29:59.820 --> 02:30:02.860]
You fear that that Roman Catholic community this day

[02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:03.960]
H. your nephew's body

[02:30:03.960 --> 02:30:04.520]
Yes

[02:30:04.520 --> 02:30:07.240]
We have on the light of Van Ays here

[02:30:07.240 --> 02:30:10.160]
A Roman Catholic priest on KFI-640

[02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:10.380]
Hello

[02:30:10.380 --> 02:30:11.280]
How you doing?

[02:30:11.520 --> 02:30:11.660]
Good

[02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:16.700]
This man, first of all, up on my condolences to you on the lock of your nephew

[02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:17.600]
Are you a priest?

[02:30:17.980 --> 02:30:18.540]
Yes I am

[02:30:18.540 --> 02:30:18.960]
Yes

[02:30:19.720 --> 02:30:22.880]
I just want to let you express something for you

[02:30:24.940 --> 02:30:27.380]
You've been misinformed about the church

[02:30:27.380 --> 02:30:28.400]
That you are a priest

[02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:29.560]
That you are a priest

[02:30:29.560 --> 02:30:31.580]
If you just hang on, I will explain to you what I believe is

[02:30:31.580 --> 02:30:32.880]
And then you can draw your own conclusion

[02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:33.780]
But you are a priest

[02:30:33.780 --> 02:30:36.840]
Let me explain what our teaching is and you draw your own conclusion

[02:30:36.840 --> 02:30:38.100]
Let the father explain

[02:30:39.400 --> 02:30:42.620]
First of all, we believe that when the New Testament is communion

[02:30:42.620 --> 02:30:45.900]
We see the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ

[02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:47.280]
Oh, to our Lord God

[02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:48.560]
We will hold on, man

[02:30:49.020 --> 02:30:51.520]
I'm just calling to let you know what our belief is

[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:52.780]
You eat flesh and blood

[02:30:52.780 --> 02:30:54.820]
If you want to look at it that way, that's fine

[02:30:54.820 --> 02:30:55.980]
Oh, my God, that's fine

[02:30:56.440 --> 02:30:59.640]
This is our belief and you draw your own conclusion

[02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:00.660]
I want to find this

[02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:03.020]
Man, you've got to let the father explain

[02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:07.760]
Well, when I want to hear him talk about it, you can see that there's been form

[02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:10.720]
This is like show raises like clad back and forth

[02:31:10.720 --> 02:31:16.700]
Okay, first of all, the answer is that because you've been misinformed about what happened to your nephew and I was looking for it

[02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:19.300]
You eat the butt, you eat the whole damn thing

[02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:22.040]
Excuse me? Don't you eat it?

[02:31:22.500 --> 02:31:23.740]
We eat the whole thing, yes

[02:31:23.740 --> 02:31:24.500]
The whole thing

[02:31:24.500 --> 02:31:27.080]
But he sees the whole body and the man

[02:31:27.980 --> 02:31:28.980]
That's not what I said

[02:31:29.700 --> 02:31:31.440]
You said you eat the blood and the flesh

[02:31:31.440 --> 02:31:32.040]
How cruel

[02:31:32.700 --> 02:31:33.480]
Call the man

[02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:35.120]
No, of Jesus Christ

[02:31:35.120 --> 02:31:37.780]
Oh, God, that is a blasphemy

[02:31:37.780 --> 02:31:39.700]
Well, if you choose to leave that

[02:31:40.420 --> 02:31:42.480]
I'm trying to do it until my part believe

[02:31:42.480 --> 02:31:44.440]
Because it is a beautiful form

[02:31:44.440 --> 02:31:46.580]
Do you eat up on the booty, too?

[02:31:46.940 --> 02:31:48.080]
I'm not even going to answer that

[02:31:48.080 --> 02:31:49.960]
I don't understand what that means

[02:31:49.960 --> 02:31:53.320]
What is this man talking about eating the Lord Jesus?

[02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:54.980]
What in the finish?

[02:31:55.120 --> 02:31:56.740]
Let him just say what he has to say

[02:31:56.740 --> 02:32:00.720]
From this scripture's man, where Jesus took bread and blessed and broke it and said

[02:32:01.160 --> 02:32:03.720]
Take this and eat it, this is my body

[02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:04.440]
Oh, God

[02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:06.120]
And then he picked the cup of wine and said

[02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:08.120]
Take and drink this is my blood

[02:32:08.580 --> 02:32:12.960]
And again he said, I'm going to eat my body and drink my blood and have no life at it

[02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:16.360]
Oh, my God, this is good Friday

[02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:17.080]
Exactly

[02:32:17.080 --> 02:32:19.180]
And you're talking about eating up on Jesus

[02:32:19.720 --> 02:32:21.060]
I can tell you that

[02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:22.100]
I wonder what we believe

[02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:23.660]
You're grabbing on Jesus' hands

[02:32:23.660 --> 02:32:24.460]
What?

[02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:26.820]
You're grabbing all our own Jesus

[02:32:26.820 --> 02:32:28.140]
If that is just a belief

[02:32:28.140 --> 02:32:30.180]
And my men ask you what about him

[02:32:30.180 --> 02:32:31.760]
Okay, ma'am, I'll say again

[02:32:31.760 --> 02:32:33.720]
I'm grabbing on Jesus and Catholics

[02:32:33.720 --> 02:32:35.660]
I'm not going to lie to my boy

[02:32:35.660 --> 02:32:37.480]
I'm not going to lie to my boy

[02:32:37.480 --> 02:32:42.140]
I'm not going to lie to my boy

[02:32:42.140 --> 02:32:44.020]
You won't laugh no more

[02:32:44.020 --> 02:32:45.420]
And I'm going to laugh no more

[02:32:45.420 --> 02:32:46.240]
You'll laugh no more

[02:32:47.380 --> 02:32:50.600]
But like some kind of Negro smog is going over there

[02:32:50.600 --> 02:32:51.800]
Well, I'll tell you

[02:32:51.800 --> 02:32:55.200]
Listen, it's Friday, I'm not going to lie to you

[02:32:55.200 --> 02:32:57.060]
It's like a brother best friend

[02:32:59.220 --> 02:33:00.520]
I'm not going to lie to you

[02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:02.640]
Listen, Father, I thank you for taking the time

[02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:03.740]
I really do

[02:33:03.740 --> 02:33:05.200]
And you have a good Easter

[02:33:05.200 --> 02:33:07.940]
You pay for your sins

[02:33:07.940 --> 02:33:09.400]
Well, only better to God

[02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:09.920]
That's true

[02:33:09.920 --> 02:33:10.760]
Thank you, Father

[02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:13.680]
That was a Roman Catholic priest

[02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:15.000]
And Mac and all my boy

[02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:16.300]
Like a brother bushing

[02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:17.820]
All you can eat

[02:33:17.820 --> 02:33:19.920]
Yeah, keep going

[02:33:25.620 --> 02:33:27.140]
What was it?

[02:33:31.580 --> 02:33:32.620]
What did you call him, man?

[02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:34.700]
All you can eat me, bro

[02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:03.880]
Yeah

[02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:07.000]
Oh, no

[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.900]
Oh, all you can eat me, bro.

[02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:11.920]
Oh, God.

[02:34:13.940 --> 02:34:15.260]
So, I understand.

[02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:17.120]
Thank you very much.

[02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:30.560]
I'm Aaron Sona.

[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:31.260]
You know what?

[02:34:32.060 --> 02:34:34.920]
You got me talking on the passion song.

[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:38.900]
Tell me the story about how you got flown.

[02:34:39.420 --> 02:34:40.060]
I got you down.

[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:40.600]
Okay.

[02:34:41.820 --> 02:34:43.280]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:44.360]
Holy cow.

[02:34:45.260 --> 02:34:46.160]
Oh, ho, ho.

[02:34:47.700 --> 02:34:51.360]
I'll tell you once more before I hang up the phone.

[02:34:51.580 --> 02:34:52.700]
I got you down.

[02:34:56.460 --> 02:34:58.060]
The lines are jammed up.

[02:34:58.320 --> 02:34:59.700]
Yeah, there isn't a doubt.

[02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:03.540]
Call up and tell me what it's all about.

[02:35:04.140 --> 02:35:05.040]
I got you down.

[02:35:06.740 --> 02:35:08.260]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:35:08.620 --> 02:35:09.320]
Holy cow.

[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:10.960]
Oh, ho, ho.

[02:35:12.740 --> 02:35:16.140]
I'll tell you once more before I hang up the phone.

[02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:17.600]
I got you down.

[02:35:20.660 --> 02:35:21.960]
I got you down.

[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:26.520]
I got you down.

[02:35:29.140 --> 02:35:30.040]
I got you down.

[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:34.160]
I got you down.

[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:41.540]
Here on this show, there's a new topic each night.

[02:35:42.540 --> 02:35:44.260]
Don't you have sex with me?

[02:35:45.620 --> 02:35:46.760]
I got you down.

[02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:49.900]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:35:50.260 --> 02:35:50.920]
Holy cow.

[02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:57.780]
I'll tell you once more before I hang up the phone.

[02:35:58.400 --> 02:35:59.260]
I got you down.

[02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:03.240]
Okay, 9-F-1 at 5.50 WQM 510 bucks over there in Adventura.

[02:36:03.420 --> 02:36:06.480]
So far, not too exciting, not too bad, not too exciting.

[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:10.260]
That gives us 123.8684.

[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:11.620]
We're getting close.

[02:36:11.620 --> 02:36:15.940]
We need another 316 bucks in the next 15-1 minutes to get 224 grand today.

[02:36:16.020 --> 02:36:16.700]
No, we're going to do it.

[02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:17.400]
Come on.

[02:36:17.420 --> 02:36:18.200]
Do we do it?

[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:18.880]
I want to hear it.

[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:19.340]
Enthusiasm.

[02:36:19.620 --> 02:36:19.760]
No.

[02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:21.280]
Okay, 12 after 1.

[02:36:21.400 --> 02:36:25.120]
Here's the greatest of bad somebody's fact is to me because I don't want to birth anybody's bubble,

[02:36:25.260 --> 02:36:27.420]
but shaky the truth and you will not read the Sun Sentinel.

[02:36:27.780 --> 02:36:28.360]
Did you see this?

[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:31.380]
Where they reprinted this, the old, trashy piece of crap.

[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:34.460]
It says on the editorial page today, Sun Sentinel.

[02:36:34.860 --> 02:36:37.420]
Well, of course, this is the same paper that told us, where's that thing?

[02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:41.020]
That told us that people who don't bet on ball games are just as interested in the odds.

[02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:43.300]
And the points breads are those who do bet on ball games.

[02:36:43.380 --> 02:36:43.820]
That's right.

[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:45.300]
So why would they lie about Fannie Claus?

[02:36:46.600 --> 02:36:50.480]
So it says one of the most famous letters to be editor ever published was written by an 80-year-old

[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:55.200]
guru who had doubts about Santa Claus in a halting hand she sought help from the New York Sun.

[02:36:55.860 --> 02:37:01.620]
The answer first published September 21st, 1897, over 100 freaking years ago,

[02:37:02.220 --> 02:37:04.460]
has stirred the hearts of American diversons.

[02:37:05.020 --> 02:37:10.140]
Today we reprint her letter in the Sun's reply, an editorial written by Francis Farsela's church.

[02:37:10.980 --> 02:37:11.800]
What a name, huh?

[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:17.960]
As in Farsicle, the editor, I'm eight years old, some of my little friends say there is no Santa Claus.

[02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:21.320]
Papa says, if you see it in the Sun, it's so, please tell me the truth.

[02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:23.720]
Is there a Santa Claus, Virginia or Hanlon?

[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:26.740]
Dear Virginia, your friends and your family, you're all full of crap.

[02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:27.600]
Oh, that's not what it is.

[02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:33.680]
No, but it goes on about, yeah, and not believe in Santa Claus, you might as well not believe in fairies.

[02:37:34.500 --> 02:37:34.560]
Huh?

[02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:38.740]
Yeah, it says nobody sees Santa Claus, but that's no sign there's no Santa Claus.

[02:37:38.740 --> 02:37:41.920]
The most real things in the world are those that neither children or men can see.

[02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:44.440]
And then here's the greatest line in this whole letter to the editor.

[02:37:45.100 --> 02:37:47.260]
Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn?

[02:37:47.460 --> 02:37:49.200]
Yeah, sure, all the time in a grove.

[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:51.440]
Well, what is that?

[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:53.280]
South Beach all the time.

[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:55.820]
Did we ever see fairies dancing on the lawn?

[02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:57.020]
And it says, of course not.

[02:37:57.240 --> 02:37:58.520]
Well, that's before we had South Beach.

[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.500]
Thank God, he lives forever.

[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:02.600]
Santa Claus is rich.

[02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:05.860]
Hey, Virginia, I hope you're still alive, although we're sure that you're down there deep in the ground

[02:38:05.860 --> 02:38:11.160]
because God works in mysterious ways, but nevertheless, there ain't no standing claws, there ain't no two fairies.

[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:14.360]
There are some fairies in South Beach and in the grove, but that's about it.

[02:38:15.540 --> 02:38:16.400]
I'm wondering why I leave it out.

[02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:17.660]
And of course, it's a God bull crack.

[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:18.360]
Don't leave that out.

[02:38:18.820 --> 02:38:20.840]
I don't know what it is, but it's moving.

[02:38:23.460 --> 02:38:26.360]
Well, I hate what I'm doing on 2 a.m.

[02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:28.860]
What's that fact that's going on again?

[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:30.760]
I want what they had before.

[02:38:30.980 --> 02:38:32.480]
These are my kind of guys.

[02:38:34.020 --> 02:38:36.480]
What the hell are they doing anyway?

[02:38:36.820 --> 02:38:39.380]
We're the manly, down the dime, really, James.

[02:38:39.900 --> 02:38:42.940]
I want more at risk for a gust of ice to feel high.

[02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:49.400]
When I listen to the sport, a manly voice won't get my attention.

[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:51.840]
I will really get to see the short.

[02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:54.740]
A squeaky high voice will give me another reaction.

[02:38:54.860 --> 02:38:57.820]
Well, I hate what we're doing on 2 a.m.

[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:00.280]
But that's back and back on again.

[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:03.760]
I'm going to miss here and straight men with voice with this high.

[02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:08.200]
Now I'll have to get deeper as I close it again.

[02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:11.000]
So I can impress all the macho fans.

[02:39:11.300 --> 02:39:14.200]
Check out Chris Moritzide to build a band inside.

[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:19.240]
There ain't nothing I can have at macho sports guys.

[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:21.140]
This voice has a classic name.

[02:39:21.340 --> 02:39:22.160]
Well, here's old.

[02:39:22.740 --> 02:39:23.940]
Yeah, I can't believe that.

[02:39:24.580 --> 02:39:25.360]
Yes, stand up.

[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:27.860]
You're close to the radio and press the sound.

[02:39:27.860 --> 02:39:29.940]
Get their voices on up there.

[02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:32.260]
If you'll mix my balls, you'll get there.

[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:34.400]
And that growl, man.

[02:39:34.980 --> 02:39:35.660]
Well, he's smart.

[02:39:35.820 --> 02:39:36.880]
I hate Red Brothers.

[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:37.580]
Yeah.

[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:38.360]
Yeah.

[02:39:57.860 --> 02:40:00.700]
I'm going to get there.

[02:40:08.140 --> 02:40:09.560]
I'm going to get there.

[02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:12.620]
I'm going to get there.

[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:13.200]

[02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:14.480]
I'm going to get there.

[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:16.000]
I'm going to get there.

[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:19.320]
I'm going to get there.

[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:23.040]
I'm going to get there.

[02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:26.620]
I'm going to get there.

[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:27.840]
I'm going to get there.

[02:40:28.700 --> 02:40:29.460]
I'm going to get there.

[02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:30.640]
Oh, my daddy.

[02:40:31.260 --> 02:40:32.740]
He wants to meet her.

[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:34.880]
You see hard working man.

[02:40:35.820 --> 02:40:38.920]
My mother, he wants to meet her.

[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:40.840]
You see this guy.

[02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:44.580]
I said, I'm going to get there.

[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:46.940]
I said, hey man, get from me instead.

[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:51.000]
Hard work, good, and hard work, fine.

[02:40:51.540 --> 02:40:53.360]
First take care of this.

[02:40:53.360 --> 02:40:59.400]
So now I hope to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join.

[02:41:00.420 --> 02:41:06.780]
I hope to join when I'm defeated again and that's every 10,000 points I'm supposed to join.

[02:41:07.100 --> 02:41:11.900]
I hope to join because it's time of the end and doing time well.

[02:41:13.220 --> 02:41:18.120]
I hope to join before I hope to join and say that I hope to more.

[02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:53.340]
I hope to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join.

[02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:53.340]

[02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:53.340]

[02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:53.340]

[02:42:08.660 --> 02:42:23.040]
I hope to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get

[02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:53.020]
up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car

[02:42:53.020 --> 02:42:56.780]
It was rather low, it was much more fun than what I was looking for.

[02:42:58.460 --> 02:43:02.100]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:08.440]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:09.700]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:43:11.020 --> 02:43:12.720]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:12.720]

[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:12.720]

[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:13.400]
That's what I do.

[02:43:14.060 --> 02:43:16.560]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:24.600]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:43:24.600 --> 02:43:25.920]

[02:44:00.380 --> 02:44:00.380]

[02:44:00.380 --> 02:44:00.380]

[02:44:00.380 --> 02:44:00.380]

[02:44:00.380 --> 02:44:00.380]

[02:44:00.380 --> 02:44:00.380]

[02:44:00.380 --> 02:44:00.860]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:44:00.860 --> 02:44:01.740]

Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:23.720]

[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:23.720]

[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:23.820]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:24.300]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:44:24.300 --> 02:44:25.120]

[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:26.020]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:44:26.020 --> 02:44:27.340]

[02:44:27.340 --> 02:44:27.500]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:30.040]

Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:53.400]

[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:53.400]

[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:53.400]

[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:53.400]

[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:53.400]

[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:53.400]

[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:53.400]

[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:53.740]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:44:53.880 --> 02:44:54.960]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:44:55.140 --> 02:44:58.800]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:44:59.340 --> 02:45:01.880]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:04.260]
Oh, they want to know with mom like air.

[02:45:04.500 --> 02:45:07.660]
They flew high and big gold chains.

[02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:10.680]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:45:14.860 --> 02:45:17.160]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:19.420]

Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:23.860]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:45:23.860 --> 02:45:24.560]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:45:24.700 --> 02:45:26.680]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:29.180]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:45:29.180 --> 02:45:31.860]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:45:31.860 --> 02:45:32.020]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:32.500]
Oh, it's just, I don't want to say that.

[02:45:32.500 --> 02:45:35.580]
He had a won't must have said I was way too tight.

[02:45:36.900 --> 02:45:37.720]
I was way too tight.

[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:38.640]
Oh, that's Zeenow.

[02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:41.800]
Oh, that's Zeenow.

[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:50.940]
Y Bellhinsy's name is from B.

[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:53.720]
This is Birch Blossom

[02:45:53.720 --> 02:45:57.760]
and he had a white muscles shirt.

[02:45:57.760 --> 02:45:59.440]
That was way too tight.

[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:00.960]
I got Zeenow.

[02:46:01.340 --> 02:46:01.780]
I got Zeenow.

[02:46:01.780 --> 02:46:04.400]
that in state of the art that protection, state of the art that protection.

[02:46:04.940 --> 02:46:06.020]
Introducing the crap.

[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:09.200]
Two and a half pounds of steaming human extra minutes that pops neatly

[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:11.480]
into the front seat of all domestic and most foreign vehicles.

[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:14.440]
Properly installed, the crap determines even those determined feet.

[02:46:15.180 --> 02:46:16.340]
Hey, nice car.

[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:18.020]
They left it door online.

[02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:19.920]
Take this car a little skid.

[02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:23.880]
Oh my God, someone took it up on the front seat.

[02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:24.920]
That is disgusting.

[02:46:25.580 --> 02:46:26.840]
I'm moving on to the next car.

[02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:28.300]
One wave of the crap.

[02:46:28.580 --> 02:46:31.280]
And these will move on to another car that doesn't have a steaming pile

[02:46:31.280 --> 02:46:32.680]
of human extra minutes on the front seat.

[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:33.840]
We guarantee it.

[02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:35.400]
Order the crap for your car today.

[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:37.860]
And anyone who tries to steal your car will be indeed.

[02:46:38.420 --> 02:46:39.340]
Well, you know.

[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:49.140]
Coming next year, the chain is taught for the tour your hometown.

[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:56.180]
During the benefit of Cardinal Classy School for wayward boys, it's Michael Jackson.

[02:46:56.180 --> 02:46:58.260]
These are my latest and take-ins.

[02:46:58.500 --> 02:47:01.100]
I've got a very epic sight.

[02:47:01.580 --> 02:47:02.540]
Michael Jackson.

[02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:03.940]
What?

[02:47:04.660 --> 02:47:06.400]
Because I've found them any time.

[02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:07.520]
Just don't matter.

[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:08.060]
Let's see.

[02:47:08.220 --> 02:47:09.340]
That's all right.

[02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:10.960]
Michael Jackson.

[02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:16.720]
Yes, Michael performs all of his great hits from all these with the Jackson sides.

[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:18.640]
There's an A, B, B.

[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.020]
I'm can down on my knees.

[02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:23.080]
We're moving the dumb, go straight.

[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:26.920]
A, B, C, Saddle, B, B, G, and B.

[02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:27.540]
That's right.

[02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:31.700]
From the time of tunes of the Jackson 5, to the classic silverware, Michael Jackson's

[02:47:31.700 --> 02:47:33.220]
benefits, who are aims to please.

[02:47:33.620 --> 02:47:36.700]
The people of the room are supposed to start using an aisle.

[02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:39.800]
Some call me big, brothers come up at a pile.

[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:41.460]
And I know what to do.

[02:47:41.620 --> 02:47:49.000]
File, hide and sit for a while and beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it.

[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:50.140]
Michael Jackson.

[02:47:50.140 --> 02:47:55.860]
Sometimes I'm so depressed that I just sit around so again waiting for a call,

[02:47:56.140 --> 02:47:57.600]
when the call you call again.

[02:47:58.020 --> 02:48:02.500]
When I'm home alone, sitting naked by the phone, I beat it, beat it.

[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:09.760]
And B, one of the five lucky boys to receive backstage passes to hang out in Michael Jackson's

[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:09.960]
presence.

[02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:12.060]
Michael Jackson's benefits.

[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:15.460]
Hey, Michael, yes, Bobby.

[02:48:15.820 --> 02:48:17.880]
Is that your real skin color?

[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:20.420]
It's inside with counts.

[02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:23.280]
But I know a game that you can play to find out.

[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:24.880]
It's inside with your slides.

[02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:26.800]
You know, it's time to free really.

[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:32.880]
Say, say, what you want, but you know who I am.

[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:34.580]
Give a fraction of me.

[02:48:34.780 --> 02:48:39.560]
You don't know how to read, but this old boy is here.

[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:41.220]
Me too, actually.

[02:48:41.380 --> 02:48:42.860]
And here's the rousing finale.

[02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:45.380]
Yes, Michael sings the song he wrote for the show in the world.

[02:48:45.380 --> 02:48:48.380]
It's the beginning of Voice Choir backing him up.

[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:50.400]
I don't like girls.

[02:48:51.740 --> 02:48:54.420]
I like real children.

[02:48:56.020 --> 02:48:59.900]
They are the ones turning on and hate.

[02:49:00.660 --> 02:49:02.060]
I hope they will.

[02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:03.700]
Yes.

[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:08.500]
It's time to make a game.

[02:49:09.580 --> 02:49:12.480]
I like to walk in the eyes.

[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:15.020]
What is your favorite music?

[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:18.200]
Will you play with it just by?

[02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:21.360]
Here are other great Michael Jackson glasses.

[02:49:22.180 --> 02:49:23.240]
Like Billy's Jane.

[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:24.640]
You know how to tell time.

[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:26.300]
And of course, smooth criminal.

[02:49:26.620 --> 02:49:30.860]
Just a Michael Jackson tour to benefit the Gargle Clancy School for Wayward Boys.

[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:31.840]
Get your tickets now.

[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:34.660]
Boys and their cinnamon is free when a company buys no one.

[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:40.820]
This black, a blue white, a blue blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue,

[02:49:54.380 --> 02:50:10.800]
a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue

[02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:40.780]
a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue

[02:50:57.860 --> 02:51:10.760]
a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue

[02:51:14.540 --> 02:51:36.780]
blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue, a blue blue...

[02:51:36.780 --> 02:51:42.340]
to teach, and to teach, a perfect that would be

[02:51:42.340 --> 02:51:50.060]
Let life hold her and sigh her arms and aim her towards the tree

[02:51:50.780 --> 02:51:57.640]
What things that I'd like to see, and that gift on TV

[02:51:57.640 --> 02:52:05.100]
I give her a gift into info by inside the winter's youth

[02:52:07.320 --> 02:52:13.540]
It's the perfect end, while it would really fit her

[02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:21.020]
The ash feels the fur husband gave, while their kids say the bitter

[02:52:22.680 --> 02:52:24.080]
What a smug

[02:52:35.100 --> 02:52:38.580]
Who's that humor gonna get laid?

[02:52:39.600 --> 02:52:43.660]
Your body's a show-tongue, not even guessing paid

[02:52:43.660 --> 02:52:47.980]
It's like you can't get girls without some beer

[02:52:47.980 --> 02:52:53.700]
Where you haven't gotten laid this week, this month, or even this year

[02:52:53.700 --> 02:52:59.340]
But I'll go down on you, when you feel lonely

[02:52:59.340 --> 02:53:01.960]
I'll go down on you

[02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:04.920]
Okay

[02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:09.280]
I'll go down on you, when you go down on me

[02:53:12.540 --> 02:53:13.020]
It's okay

[02:53:13.020 --> 02:53:16.740]
It's the perfect end, but it's the bad bone

[02:53:16.740 --> 02:53:22.360]
I'm a nut, I'm a nut, my life, don't ever get in a rut

[02:53:23.520 --> 02:53:25.800]
It'll match all of this, so I'll lose tonight

[02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:28.640]
God says God gave her a new slot, I ain't crazy

[02:53:28.640 --> 02:53:30.020]
I'm a nut

[02:53:30.640 --> 02:53:35.200]
Is it wetter, under water, if you're there, when it rains?

[02:53:35.720 --> 02:53:41.340]
Is it shorter to New York, and it is by plane between myself and I

[02:53:41.340 --> 02:53:45.540]
I wonder who's the number, is it slaughtered down south?

[02:53:45.900 --> 02:53:47.360]
Then it is in the summer

[02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:51.320]
Beef, pea, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap

[02:53:51.320 --> 02:53:56.660]
I'm a nut, I'm a nut, my life, don't ever get in a rut

[02:53:57.900 --> 02:54:00.580]
It'll match all of this, so I'll lose tonight

[02:54:00.580 --> 02:54:03.400]
God says God gave her a new slot, I ain't crazy

[02:54:03.400 --> 02:54:10.000]
I'm a nut, I drove my cattle like a Vegas, do that is by my luck

[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:14.040]
Well, then deal with it, don't make us on a grey pound bus

[02:54:14.040 --> 02:54:16.560]
I should have said the words on by

[02:54:16.560 --> 02:54:21.660]
While I was back, but remember only for as far as breathing birds

[02:54:21.860 --> 02:54:26.420]
Is it b-bap, b-bap, b-bap, b-bap, b-bap, b-bap, b-bap

[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:32.100]
Billy, he's mom, not another animal

[02:54:32.100 --> 02:54:35.680]
Kids just hate getting animals, and moms hate giving them

[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:38.820]
But now there's a brand new animal that kids just love

[02:54:38.820 --> 02:54:40.600]
Introducing new animal animals

[02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:43.920]
The candy coated chocolate animal that makes getting cleaned out fun

[02:54:43.920 --> 02:54:45.500]
Hey mom, can I have another animal?

[02:54:45.960 --> 02:54:48.500]
I don't know Billy, that makes your third animal today

[02:54:48.500 --> 02:54:53.900]
Please, well, okay, cool off, then this time I want a green one

[02:54:53.900 --> 02:54:56.020]
Well, sorry son, I took all the green ones

[02:54:56.020 --> 02:54:58.260]
I'm dead, my two boys

[02:54:58.920 --> 02:55:02.120]
New animal animals, melts in your butt, not in your head

[02:55:10.380 --> 02:55:15.720]
If I work for the pecs, I'm the other here, the other here

[02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:18.100]
Oi!

[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:23.020]
Old baby, old guy, the other here

[02:55:23.020 --> 02:55:25.100]
If I want the pecs, I'm going

[02:55:25.740 --> 02:55:26.320]
Oi!

[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:28.520]
I buy up all this patience

[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:33.500]
Like the life of love in Zeta, I use to be the high old man

[02:55:33.500 --> 02:55:34.160]
Roy!

[02:55:34.900 --> 02:55:41.060]
I have lots of money in the bank, annoying ones that go in like Roy

[02:55:41.060 --> 02:55:46.300]
I'd have already all net work that nobody carries

[02:55:46.300 --> 02:55:49.240]
But everyone has that on the spot

[02:55:50.060 --> 02:55:55.280]
TV cable, realistic, I would own

[02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:05.220]
I'd have a half a dozen big effemations and 607 AM station schools

[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:11.320]
And that's just in hell and they'll all alone

[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:12.280]
Oi!

[02:56:14.420 --> 02:56:19.380]
If I work for pecs, I'm the other here, the other here

[02:56:21.920 --> 02:56:26.040]
Old baby, old guy, the bill with my number

[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:28.920]
If I work for pecs and boys

[02:56:28.920 --> 02:56:32.440]
I'd rearrange the whole map

[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:35.600]
The other here, the other here, the other here

[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:36.660]
The other here, the other here

[02:56:38.320 --> 02:56:41.680]
I've have shackles, you know what I mean

[02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:45.940]
I see rists, they're the freaking queen

[02:56:45.940 --> 02:56:49.560]
Wayne High Zenga would be for an increase

[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:52.820]
If I bought that pecs and boys

[02:56:53.440 --> 02:56:53.820]
Oi!

[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:05.860]
I had a checkmate pay, one day she flew away

[02:57:05.860 --> 02:57:10.660]
To Tio on a web of who lives through the double-wheel

[02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:14.100]
But with our right wing censorship

[02:57:14.820 --> 02:57:16.500]
There are words of muslims that

[02:57:17.500 --> 02:57:20.500]
Do we tell you how I feel for K?

[02:57:20.740 --> 02:57:21.000]
K?

[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:22.820]
For K?

[02:57:23.620 --> 02:57:28.900]
So, if you see K, if you wanna

[02:57:29.900 --> 02:57:33.120]
I'll see you if Tio wanna choose

[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:37.780]
O, if you see K, tell her I'm a service day

[02:57:37.780 --> 02:57:40.780]
And the FCC won't let me sing this

[02:57:40.780 --> 02:57:43.760]
So I'll not roll to say how if you see K?

[02:57:44.380 --> 02:57:45.920]
Take her hand, tell you say

[02:57:45.920 --> 02:57:48.300]
And after the strength mission

[02:57:48.300 --> 02:57:50.120]
I'll be out in 90 days

[02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:53.300]
O, if you see K, if you wanna

[02:57:53.820 --> 02:57:56.360]
Then I'll see you with Tio

[02:57:56.360 --> 02:57:57.880]
Why not go, why not go

[02:57:57.880 --> 02:57:59.920]
But God, I'll see you with Tio

[02:58:00.440 --> 02:58:01.380]
Why not go

[02:58:06.900 --> 02:58:08.880]
137 and 56, you know what I'm saying

[02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:10.320]
Don't forget we know who's gonna be here tomorrow

[02:58:10.320 --> 02:58:12.320]
We got all kinds of ball games, we got sports ran

[02:58:12.320 --> 02:58:14.080]
Radio because it's God and Christmas Day

[02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:15.120]
Okay, are we gonna be here tomorrow?

[02:58:15.320 --> 02:58:15.480]
No!

[02:58:15.820 --> 02:58:15.920]
Nobody!

[02:58:16.140 --> 02:58:16.520]
Thank God

[02:58:17.200 --> 02:58:19.080]
But the hangs coming up next will be along today's

[02:58:19.720 --> 02:58:22.060]
Got a show from 2 to 5, then in the 5 to 6 hour

[02:58:22.060 --> 02:58:24.140]
The Jimmy Johnson showed last one of the regular season

[02:58:24.140 --> 02:58:26.160]
And then we got sports ran Radio 6

[02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:28.080]
Because even the 8 lock won off on Christmas Eve

[02:58:28.660 --> 02:58:29.300]
It's cold

[02:58:30.340 --> 02:58:31.180]
Little rock

[02:58:33.060 --> 02:58:35.300]
Turn on K through a hundred G

[02:58:35.980 --> 02:58:36.940]
And we're going

[02:58:38.860 --> 02:58:41.080]
Just in that flag of Hillary

[02:58:41.780 --> 02:58:42.940]
Power of rookies

[02:58:42.940 --> 02:58:44.340]
Automatic transaction

[02:58:44.940 --> 02:58:45.460]
Flesh engaging

[02:58:45.460 --> 02:58:46.760]
That's absolutely

[02:58:46.760 --> 02:58:48.820]
Little rock

[02:58:48.820 --> 02:58:50.620]
Little rock

[02:58:50.620 --> 02:58:52.880]
Oh God, so strong

[02:58:52.880 --> 02:58:57.820]
It puts the lotion in the basket

[02:59:04.940 --> 02:59:07.140]
Oh, it's all found on the street

[02:59:07.140 --> 02:59:09.140]
Miss the girl's hands

[02:59:09.140 --> 02:59:12.020]
Give that song for my part

[02:59:12.020 --> 02:59:13.780]
Is this thing?

[02:59:14.260 --> 02:59:14.700]
Oh, rock

[02:59:14.700 --> 02:59:17.940]
It's beautiful and it's fine

[02:59:17.940 --> 02:59:20.020]
How can I go down?

[02:59:20.960 --> 02:59:23.100]
It gets in from girls

[02:59:23.100 --> 02:59:25.100]
They're broken bones

[02:59:25.100 --> 02:59:27.840]
Never tried to be high

[02:59:27.840 --> 02:59:29.380]
But 16

[02:59:30.140 --> 02:59:33.700]
It's beautiful and it's fine

[02:59:33.700 --> 02:59:36.140]
Oh, man, I'm happy

[02:59:36.460 --> 02:59:38.580]
It goes crazy

[02:59:39.460 --> 02:59:40.300]
When it's bad

[02:59:41.460 --> 02:59:44.260]
When it's bigger it's better yet

[02:59:44.260 --> 02:59:46.360]
But it's still my hand

[02:59:46.360 --> 02:59:47.980]
It's touched my chest

[02:59:47.980 --> 02:59:48.500]
For sure

[02:59:49.460 --> 02:59:50.580]
When it blooms

[02:59:50.580 --> 02:59:53.580]
It ruined my best became my world

[02:59:54.460 --> 02:59:56.100]
And through my life

[02:59:56.100 --> 02:59:59.000]
Oh, how it makes me feel fine

[02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:00.620]
It's 16

[03:00:01.460 --> 03:00:05.160]
So beautiful and it's fine

[03:00:06.460 --> 03:00:06.920]
It's a great song

[03:00:06.920 --> 03:00:07.120]
It's a great song

[03:00:14.480 --> 03:00:15.080]
It's a great song

[03:00:15.080 --> 03:00:17.460]
Hey, you Jennifer Capriotti here

[03:00:17.460 --> 03:00:19.560]
And when I'm left and balled on the court

[03:00:19.560 --> 03:00:21.780]
I'm getting doned off my aunt

[03:00:21.780 --> 03:00:23.520]
And I get my best hit

[03:00:23.520 --> 03:00:26.440]
Off the Jennifer Capriotti cut his ball can bomb

[03:00:26.440 --> 03:00:29.640]
That's right, it's the Jennifer Capriotti

[03:00:29.640 --> 03:00:31.580]
10 is ball can bomb

[03:00:31.580 --> 03:00:33.480]
Cops will never suspect it

[03:00:33.480 --> 03:00:34.720]
It has been looking bad

[03:00:34.720 --> 03:00:37.500]
Just empty the balls, screw on the ball

[03:00:37.500 --> 03:00:38.620]
Fill it with water

[03:00:38.620 --> 03:00:41.480]
And you're set to destroy brain cells

[03:00:41.480 --> 03:00:43.580]
The Jennifer Capriotti way

[03:00:46.960 --> 03:00:52.040]
Oh, this is so smooth

[03:00:53.160 --> 03:00:56.560]
It's the bomb that sings it's a tennis ball can

[03:00:56.560 --> 03:01:00.080]
A tennis ball can that sings it's a bomb

[03:01:00.080 --> 03:01:01.260]
First beat's benefit

[03:01:01.260 --> 03:01:03.040]
The Jennifer Capriotti leaves his offense

[03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:04.560]
But normal approved

[03:01:11.980 --> 03:01:16.340]
There he was just a walking on the sea sand

[03:01:16.340 --> 03:01:19.280]
New I did it, it did it, dumb did it

[03:01:20.100 --> 03:01:23.940]
He's a man from the land of calories sand

[03:01:23.940 --> 03:01:27.160]
New I did it, it did it, dumb did it

[03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:30.280]
He's good, he's good, he's good

[03:01:30.280 --> 03:01:31.360]
He's divine, he's divine

[03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:33.260]
He's good, he's divine

[03:01:33.260 --> 03:01:35.220]
Changes water into one

[03:01:35.220 --> 03:01:39.160]
The next thing I knew we had a layman on his feet singing

[03:01:39.800 --> 03:01:43.100]
Two I did it, it did it, dumb did it, dumb

[03:01:43.100 --> 03:01:45.020]
Stop lying not gonna see

[03:01:45.020 --> 03:01:47.620]
And the dumb is on his feet singing

[03:01:47.620 --> 03:01:50.940]
Two I did it, it did it, dumb did it, dumb did it, dumb

[03:01:50.940 --> 03:01:55.820]
He walked on, walked on

[03:01:55.820 --> 03:01:58.940]
him надrrupt my dog and he cured a lubbersource

[03:02:01.720 --> 03:02:06.700]
To what I'm saying is the son of God

[03:02:10.340 --> 03:02:14.580]
Yes, they do but there's all the people thinking so I

[03:02:14.580 --> 03:02:17.180]
Now, he's the reason that we

[03:02:17.180 --> 03:02:19.600]
have any sideace and tumble

[03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:20.360]
I dead

[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:22.620]
It did it, dumb did it, dumb did it

[03:02:22.780 --> 03:02:26.880]
And he's the reason that all the Christians pray say,

[03:02:26.960 --> 03:02:30.160]
And do I dare to dare to dumb dare to

[03:02:30.160 --> 03:02:34.180]
They praise him, praise him, kneel down, kneel down,

[03:02:34.460 --> 03:02:38.080]
Praise him and kneel down, the man who wore a thorny crown.

[03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:42.180]
Do I dare to dare to dumb dare to

[03:02:42.180 --> 03:02:46.040]
Do I dare to dare to dumb dare to

[03:02:46.580 --> 03:02:49.880]
Do I dare to dare to dumb he's a Jew

[03:02:49.880 --> 03:02:53.800]
Do I dare to dare to dumb he's a Jew

[03:02:53.800 --> 03:02:57.720]
Do I dare to dare to dumb he's a Jew

[03:02:57.720 --> 03:03:03.500]
Do I dare to dare to dumb he's a Jew

[03:03:03.500 --> 03:03:12.680]
An ant of picky, clearly owes you thrive on that archery

[03:03:12.680 --> 03:03:16.440]
Artific and arena for the Miami-Dade

[03:03:16.440 --> 03:03:20.040]
Happy to arena, somehow don't seem right

[03:03:20.040 --> 03:03:23.700]
Better ask your foe in poor financial aid, five

[03:03:24.440 --> 03:03:31.940]
And the age my cow, there's no best if all they're all all strife

[03:03:31.940 --> 03:03:38.920]
Let's turn this place down, and ensure it's just what you're being right

[03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:42.580]
Before we move our ass, take the tan of scuttle

[03:03:42.580 --> 03:03:47.000]
Like that, that's not all I can't say I can

[03:03:47.580 --> 03:03:51.580]
I see that's all I can

[03:03:53.660 --> 03:04:00.580]
Oh, I see that's all I can

[03:04:01.220 --> 03:04:03.060]
I see that's all I can't say

[03:04:03.580 --> 03:04:11.820]
I see that's all I can't say

[03:04:11.820 --> 03:04:16.120]
I see that's all I can't say

[03:04:20.840 --> 03:04:23.840]
That's weak, I did the craziest thing

[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:26.680]
I knew the hope is to learn and keep on it

[03:04:26.680 --> 03:04:30.680]
And then I hit the street to go check out my stuff

[03:04:30.680 --> 03:04:33.700]
And what happened was right on the garbage

[03:04:33.700 --> 03:04:36.920]
There was a black guy standing on the corner

[03:04:36.920 --> 03:04:41.120]
I said to him, I was up and your blood was going down

[03:04:41.120 --> 03:04:44.500]
And he looked at me as if I was some kind of brain

[03:04:44.500 --> 03:04:48.040]
And you won't believe what he called me

[03:04:48.040 --> 03:04:49.780]
Take the broom, take the broom

[03:04:49.780 --> 03:04:54.140]
Now how did he look like the kids of those kids of those best youth

[03:04:54.140 --> 03:04:56.800]
Don't like the kids of those kids of those

[03:04:56.800 --> 03:05:00.720]
Now how did he look like the kids of those kids of those youth

[03:05:01.540 --> 03:05:03.580]
He said he bought a safe for you

[03:05:03.580 --> 03:05:06.160]
And he pulled out a gun and said a fish

[03:05:06.160 --> 03:05:08.900]
And I'm just learning to buy an X-1 or one

[03:05:08.900 --> 03:05:12.280]
And he named that fish and said he has less than one old youth

[03:05:12.900 --> 03:05:16.040]
Come on, stop a new fox, a fox, a fox, a fox

[03:05:16.040 --> 03:05:18.400]
As I lay there, I thought I was dying

[03:05:19.200 --> 03:05:21.140]
Somebody called the paramedics

[03:05:21.900 --> 03:05:26.220]
I presume there's another dude said that he was set at conkey boys

[03:05:26.220 --> 03:05:27.760]
Do the body good, Ken?

[03:05:28.060 --> 03:05:29.540]
And we'll be good, Sam, you

[03:05:29.540 --> 03:05:31.380]
Take the broom, take the broom

[03:05:31.900 --> 03:05:35.780]
Now how did he look like the kids of those kids of those best youth

[03:05:35.780 --> 03:05:38.740]
Don't like the kids of those kids of those

[03:05:38.740 --> 03:05:40.060]
Do the body good, Ken?

[03:05:40.060 --> 03:05:41.880]
Don't like the kids of those kids of those

[03:05:45.200 --> 03:05:49.740]
Now how did he look like the kids of those kids of those best youth

[03:05:49.740 --> 03:05:51.920]
Do the body good, Ken?

[03:05:53.280 --> 03:05:55.960]
Don't like the kids of those kids of those

[03:05:57.580 --> 03:05:59.580]
To do the body good, Ken?

[03:05:59.580 --> 03:06:00.980]
One day we are going to have a good test

[03:06:00.980 --> 03:06:02.040]
And when we do it as quiz here

[03:06:02.040 --> 03:06:07.860]

[03:06:07.860 --> 03:06:11.300]

[03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:28.520]
PMS Florida presents Mr. Joe Pesci.

[03:06:28.980 --> 03:06:35.940]
Hello, this is Joe Pesci. You probably know me from my roles as a psychotic foul mouth acts murderer

[03:06:35.940 --> 03:06:40.500]
Huskock, but that one time they is on the team and I'd like to

[03:06:40.500 --> 03:06:41.720]
look out of character.

[03:06:42.600 --> 03:06:46.540]
But there's a special place in my eye the Valentine's Day.

[03:06:47.180 --> 03:06:52.000]
Why I can't remember back way back in the days of my youth I was sitting there in the car

[03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:57.680]
In the kitchen she was covering as she wanted the break in ortho week because I was

[03:06:57.680 --> 03:07:02.500]
Italian but that I was there from the wrong element. Can you believe that coming from that

[03:07:02.500 --> 03:07:06.200]
You bet. That's it. So I got the hell out of there.

[03:07:06.240 --> 03:07:10.160]
So I got out of the f***ing car. Why are we still f***ing moving?

[03:07:11.280 --> 03:07:14.840]
A couple of weeks later I was feeling kind of a bit about it.

[03:07:14.840 --> 03:07:17.820]
Now I said it's a f***ing flower from the PMS.

[03:07:18.080 --> 03:07:18.220]
Florida.

[03:07:18.720 --> 03:07:25.180]
Remember this Valentine's Day to tell her you love her with PMS.

[03:07:30.160 --> 03:07:37.260]
And now the sound of Pamela Lee breastfeeding on the set of Baywatch.

[03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:44.120]
Oh it's good.

[03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:46.640]
Listen good stuff Pamela.

[03:07:51.620 --> 03:07:53.380]
Oh it's good stuff.

[03:07:54.180 --> 03:07:56.280]
It's easy to speak Spanish.

[03:07:56.660 --> 03:07:56.980]
Really?

[03:07:57.380 --> 03:07:58.660]
What do you wear on your feet?

[03:07:59.000 --> 03:07:59.440]
Socks.

[03:07:59.660 --> 03:08:00.900]

[03:08:01.040 --> 03:08:01.920]

[03:08:05.200 --> 03:08:06.440]

[03:08:14.560 --> 03:08:16.520]
T-A-N-T-Y-H-O-S-E.

[03:08:16.700 --> 03:08:18.460]
Do you know what that means in Portuguese?

[03:08:18.900 --> 03:08:19.100]
No.

[03:08:19.420 --> 03:08:22.380]
You just said stuff that trout down my pants please.

[03:08:22.720 --> 03:08:24.220]
Wow Portuguese is easy.

[03:08:24.460 --> 03:08:30.000]

[03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.860]

[03:08:35.420 --> 03:08:36.100]

[03:08:36.300 --> 03:08:37.740]

[03:08:42.920 --> 03:08:43.520]

[03:08:43.680 --> 03:08:44.380]
Give me a break.

[03:08:44.720 --> 03:08:45.820]
Can you spell break?

[03:08:46.120 --> 03:08:47.180]

[03:08:47.540 --> 03:08:48.420]

[03:08:48.420 --> 03:08:49.000]
Oh shut up.

[03:08:49.140 --> 03:08:49.740]
That's ridiculous.

[03:08:50.340 --> 03:08:51.420]
Can you spell ridiculous?

[03:08:57.680 --> 03:09:01.000]
The side I used to say to a rabbit with our...

[03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:02.240]
and how they're calling it.

[03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:03.340]
No player part.

[03:09:03.600 --> 03:09:04.940]
I drew to the loo.

[03:09:05.060 --> 03:09:06.940]
Say this time for a change.

[03:09:08.060 --> 03:09:11.560]
The new rules are you have to show up in your underwear.

[03:09:12.580 --> 03:09:14.560]
And no one ugly is allowed in there.

[03:09:14.880 --> 03:09:16.060]
So you'll have lots of fun.

[03:09:16.640 --> 03:09:18.240]
Checking out those fun.

[03:09:19.540 --> 03:09:21.240]
Find different lines down.

[03:09:21.800 --> 03:09:24.000]
So I can get my things up.

[03:09:24.900 --> 03:09:26.420]
When the game is over,

[03:09:26.720 --> 03:09:28.860]
Hey, catch my bygroom to the loo

[03:09:28.860 --> 03:09:31.940]
and back around over my old ding-bong.

[03:09:32.500 --> 03:09:34.600]
Now you can see a lot more after the game.

[03:09:35.060 --> 03:09:37.420]
Since everybody is untressed and safe,

[03:09:37.680 --> 03:09:38.740]
and you can look around

[03:09:38.740 --> 03:09:41.100]
and see what hanging down.

[03:09:41.960 --> 03:09:44.700]
This is paradise, I never realized

[03:09:44.700 --> 03:09:46.820]
how good it would feel being glad

[03:09:46.820 --> 03:09:50.280]
if my jockey hasn't put off the old Mr. Robbie has gone.

[03:09:50.900 --> 03:09:52.520]
And now it's the D-park.

[03:09:54.620 --> 03:09:54.700]
Yeah.

[03:09:56.500 --> 03:09:57.140]
Yeah.

[03:09:58.140 --> 03:09:58.140]

[03:09:58.140 --> 03:09:59.280]
Look at this.

[03:09:59.600 --> 03:10:01.060]
It's on that one, man.

[03:10:01.580 --> 03:10:02.520]
I'm gonna throw it on the table.

[03:10:02.760 --> 03:10:04.200]
I'm gonna wrap it all over the wall.

[03:10:04.720 --> 03:10:05.840]
You check that out.
