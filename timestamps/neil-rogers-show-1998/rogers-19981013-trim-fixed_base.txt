[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]

A double cheeseburger, a double cheeseburger, onion rings, and a large, arms drink.

[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:20.040]
This is the same guy that had a guy smoking pot on the year on Kennence Frequency a couple of months ago, way back when in those early, when he days.

[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.940]
He said it's okay to be smoking marijuana on television, no less, much less in the house.

[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.920]
He said, I'm not a dog, I mean his eyes darting around like a cornered rat, I think would be a good expression, a good analogy.

[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.140]
The first amendment is for everybody, including broadcasters on your television station.

[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:42.260]
The first amendment is for everybody, including broadcasters on your television station.

[00:13:48.320 --> 00:14:02.420]
The first amendment is for everybody, including broadcasters on your television station.

[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:42.520]
The second amendment is for everybody, including broadcasters on your television station.

[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:51.940]
That's right, bad lesson involved in your okay? See, we can't moralize for everybody else. If you've got to learn things at home.

[00:14:52.720 --> 00:15:02.560]
This is another example of parental lack of responsibility. Teach your kids about drugs, about not smoking cigarettes, about don't do what I do, do what I say, because that's what most of you believe anyway.

[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:23.720]
So, what's up? I'm ordering myself five whiskey straight up. I just had my first hummer.

[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.900]
Hey, Freddie, boy, hey, bartender, get my buddy here, a celebration gold. He just had his first hummer.

[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.900]
It's her times like these when you really want a party that you should settle for no less than a celebration gold beer.

[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:41.120]
Hey, Mikey, thanks a bunch. If a celebration gold don't get this taste out of my mouth, nothing will.

[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:51.280]
And it's for times like these that you need a celebration game. The only beer with real mouthwash and it's make that a celebration game, bartender.

[00:15:51.340 --> 00:16:01.180]
I'm like, game, Mikey. I just needed some cash. I was take the beer and shut up, Frankie. Celebration gold and celebration, gay. The best beer for any occasion. I'm not.

[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:09.380]
Just move over. Will you, Frankie? Yeah, over there is good. 1044-560 WQ. I guess they must have never had mad magazine in Israel, huh?

[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:15.640]
Because the Maddie is upbringing never understood what sat there is all about. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:27.860]
Okay, thank you. Here's the pompano. Hello. Pompano. Yes, sir. First of all, I'd like to say I was visited by the secret service last week.

[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:37.600]
And second law, I'd say that by the secret service. Yes. I called my state representatives second time of my life.

[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:51.160]
And I complained and stated that I believe that the government was illegal totally. Even though I'm a registered Democrat, I saw your show last night or I saw a clip of your show the night before on WAMI.

[00:16:51.420 --> 00:17:05.660]
Yeah. And I believe that marijuana should be legalized and the government shouldn't terrorize because I accused my representative of feeding into financial terrorism along from him all the way up to Bill Clinton.

[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:17.400]
Hey, let me ask you something. What language are you speaking? What are you talking about? I'm talking about people having a misrepresentation and court and government.

[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:23.680]
Okay, great. Melissa, there's one good, one vote against smoking weed right there. Okay. I think I may take the cap off.

[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:33.300]
Two open lines a day. Look at this. Is this audience worked up to a friendship about this or what? No. Two open lines a day, two and brown. 566-705-60-Pomp-560-Animable-One Line.

[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.860]
Unbelievable. Here's Carl Gables. Hello.

[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.220]
That last guy was talking about no taxation without representation.

[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:48.840]
Yeah. I was just talking. I was thinking, if you want to end the deficit, we'll legalize marijuana. Biggest tax-stopping America may have already been said.

[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.880]
But I just wanted to call and say that and how proud I am. So happy I am that you're talking about this today.

[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.700]
It's such a great subject and that's really all I had to say.

[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:03.060]
Okay. God bless you, sir. Go smoke some more. Okay. There's two reasons to keep it legal right there.

[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:09.260]
Although this guy, he wasn't doing weed. He was on speed this last kid. He sounded like who I think he was doing helium.

[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.880]
Here's a poppin'o. Hello.

[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.040]
Neil. Yes, sir. Sounded like Geldian Drag. Yes, sir.

[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:26.880]
Good morning, sir. Listen, you talk it today. It's very informative to the point where I think it should be legalized because if people want to grow it, how this bit sell it and package it,

[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:34.020]
it could do with the economy good. It does no harm. It doesn't leave to other things.

[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:41.860]
Only a person that is going to bring you to a Brit and say, jump. You have a choice. You're either going to jump or you're going to say screw you.

[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.500]
Doesn't make you do any other drugs any more than drag it in a door.

[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:49.960]
Of course. That's a great card liquor. That kind of mentality is that prohibition mentality is how it knickers.

[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:55.480]
It's because the only reason why they don't take a look at it and nicotine out this shelf is because the taxes.

[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.080]
The taxes and because it's big business. They're making money.

[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.700]
The enormous business, yes. The enormous.

[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:15.820]
So I think what you should do is pick up your campaign like you spoke of last week, you know harm, make bumpers, pickers, make buttons and just kicking it to full force and say, hey, 80% of the people in this world anyway.

[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:21.100]
We have an open lot. This is part of that hypocrisy that America is all about saying, sanctumony is hypocrites.

[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.720]
Don't do as we do. Do as we say. And just like the Clinton thing with a sex.

[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:33.360]
I mean, it's a lie out there on a straight day in between who gets it up who doesn't like oral sex. Oh, okay. I'm talking about the receiving end.

[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:41.760]
But oh my God, this was terrible and disgusting. All these people get up there and say the things that they believe that they're supposed to say.

[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:50.880]
It's like when they take a poll and they put the question in such a way that they know the kind of response they're going to elicit because people think that they're supposed to say a certain thing.

[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:59.660]
Have you ever had a homosexual experience? No, of course not. Do you think I'm some kind of a fag? I don't mean me, of course.

[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:07.180]
I'm not just some kind of a fag. I'm like a major big league fag. I'm just talking about your ordinary pedestrian, poli out there who's getting pulled so to speak.

[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:17.000]
Have you ever, have you ever inhaled? Oh, see the fact that we had to have even a discussion that there had to be a question about Bill Clinton.

[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:24.140]
Here they had the sanctimonious born again Christian, one of Paula Jones attorneys on 60 minutes last week, a week ago, Sunday.

[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:32.560]
He not only did weed and inhale, he was doing heroin. He was doing LSD. Every drugs that we haven't even heard of before. But now he accepted Jesus.

[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:37.680]
He's always okay. And he's probably up there in Conway, Georgia looking for the Virgin Mary looking for the good stuff.

[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:48.500]
Saint the Monious hypocrisy. America, you've got to grow up. That's the message. That's my message. That's the message in his car that I got on my camp.

[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:55.860]
And if this fat bald headed Israeli wants to put the show on that I live up to his word, then I'll take the cap off tomorrow.

[00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:01.040]
We can go back to putting the show on there that might get somebody to watch it the next two or three weeks and keep these poor bastards working in here.

[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:16.180]
We don't know where the next meal is coming from. I'm willing to compromise. I'm not a total hard ass. But if the guy really means what he says and is willing to understand the message that is coming from here, when they had out loud on the air, didn't they discuss legalization marijuana?

[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:24.940]
Didn't they discuss legalization prostitution? Didn't they discuss Saddle Massacism? Every kind of issue you could ever discuss as I recall. Of course, it shows off the year now.

[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:37.760]
Because it was direct, but nevertheless, see that was okay. But when you use some kind of a prop in here to make a satirical statement, oh my God, that's a bad message you're sending out.

[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:48.440]
I wonder if are they banning beer commercials on that station, by the way? Did they have beer commercials on whany? No. But have they banned them? No, they're just not getting anybody.

[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:58.060]
But if they were to put the Budweiser frogs on there, they were on the pay to buy Budweiser spots at that station. Would they, er, you make your suite as they would? They take the money.

[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:12.400]
Oh, that's not illegal. Yeah. And how about all the ball game? Well, wait a minute. How about all the ball games? Budweiser is the biggest single sponsor of every sporting event. And in Canada, with the hockey games, it's most an end of that beer.

[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:22.700]
I don't you think that there are enormous millions of kids that are watching those sporting events? You bet your suite at and doesn't attend them? Is there a message in there that it's great to drink beer?

[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:31.920]
If you're watching a sporting event, some little kids use that commercial with the Budweiser frogs and how cute they are, which is like one step away from Joe Cannell. Oh, there you go.

[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:42.180]
Here's a mobile and curl springs. Hello. Thank you, Neil, for bringing up this whole issue. The issue isn't really whether you're in favor of marijuana or not.

[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:56.360]
The issue was your right to express your opinion and be free in this country. Freedom, freedom. And too many people in this country haven't got the foggiest idea what freedom is all about, which like I said is what makes Amsterdam the greatest city in the world.

[00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:07.640]
And what what whammy he seems to be doing is is cowering into this conservative totalitarianism, which is making everybody afraid to express their opinion and be free.

[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:17.320]
And how can somebody who claims to be a director of a TV station come on a year and say the first amendment is only for the little guy in the street corner, the little underling out there, they can go on his soapbox on the street corner.

[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:26.040]
The first amendment last time I checked was for all of us. Exactly. He as a holder of a public license, his position should be to protect our rights, not to restrict them.

[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.960]
And thank you, Neil. Amen God bless you, sir.

[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:38.740]
Thank you. God bless you. We have an open line and see because I forgot to mention on the DNH show, which the natural show, but on there, that was a great show.

[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:51.000]
That should have been on there, didn't get on there because that was wearing his cat. So the message becomes unheard by the TV audience, those 30 people watching the whole listen to the radio show, unheard because I'm wearing his cat on a show.

[00:23:52.420 --> 00:24:06.320]
But I forgot to mention that one of the most important tenants of the Duno harm religion is TNC take no crap, which for years, I told you, that's a very important part of my philosophy.

[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:16.440]
And of course, that that evolves during the course of your lifetime when your young have to take a certain amount of crap from your parents, from your teachers in school, then when you go out and you get your first jobs, you have to take certain amount of crap from your bosses.

[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:23.480]
But then hopefully as you evolve in life and as you work your way into a stronger position, you have to take less and less crap.

[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.320]
You hope to reach the point where you don't have to take any crap in life.

[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:39.540]
Life is too short. Why should I or anybody else have to take crap from somebody who's on a goddamn, could pulp freak script? What the hell should I have to take crap from him?

[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.380]
We doesn't even know what he's talking about.

[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.740]
Oh, we're going to get him to knock him under. We're going to show him, yeah, right. Blow it out your ass.

[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:49.640]
Yes, sir. Hello.

[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.700]
Oh, God. Yes, sir.

[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:59.420]
I am just applauding here on this show. This is great, man. I just woke up this morning, turned on the show and I just thought it was amazing.

[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:06.120]
But one thing you haven't talked about is this ridiculous, this ridiculous paradox of drug testing.

[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:15.220]
I mean, this whole deal of, all right, fine. It's illegal. It's hard enough that we got to pay these extraordinary prices for a gram of a plant.

[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.820]
Much less that they have to take care of what we can do on our free time.

[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.240]
Exactly.

[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:24.400]
I mean, just a 56. The fact that I mean, I imagine you know, the last certain job here.

[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:31.400]
I can see if I'm going to have open a heart surgery and then Mount Sinai, the chief operating surgeon or shouldn't be on drugs.

[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.880]
He should submit the drug testing because he shouldn't be stoned out of his mind if he's going to do open heart surgery.

[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:44.360]
But I can only think of a very limited number. You know, if I want to get on a commercial jet, I would think that the pilot, you know, probably shouldn't be stoned out of his mind if he's going to fly me safely wherever I'm going.

[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:49.460]
But a very limited number of occupations like that where you deal with people's life and death.

[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.380]
But other than that, it's not their goddamn business.

[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.720]
Some kid at efforts does not need to be drug test. Right.

[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.080]
What? So he can clean the aisle a little bit faster.

[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:56.440]
Exactly.

[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.680]
It's absolutely ridiculous.

[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:08.500]
It's just, it's an and the whole whammy thing. I just want to tell you something and me and my friends, there is nothing we enjoy more than sitting around and doing bonk hits while watching Neil at night.

[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:09.120]
There you go.

[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:15.680]
There is just nothing more pleasurable. It's fun. You may be sure it's fighting. It's great. And whammy is a bunch of idiots for canceling you if they do.

[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.160]
Okay.

[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.440]
And also Neil,

[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:23.800]
unless we show you were talking about how to know if you were kidding. You were talking about doing a fast, the cleansing fast.

[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:24.100]
Yeah.

[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.180]
Yeah. Just like to tell you, I'm four days into one. And I'm feeling great, man.

[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:28.640]
Really?

[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:34.320]
I'm just feeling like I'm top of the world. I just, you know, I haven't eaten a thing in four days and I just ask you.

[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.760]
Well, I'm asking to lunch at mommy's today. I'll guarantee you that. Have a great day, pal. See you.

[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.340]
And by the way, no mind on bread today, my just a reminder.

[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:52.560]
Now, you know what's going to happen? There'll be that will not come up in conversation because you know, there's an old saying the less said the better and in certain cases, that's very true.

[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:59.660]
So there's nothing for me to say to my mother or for her to try to defend about the mental bread that she gave me to take to John, et cetera, and so on.

[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.960]
That didn't wind up making it quite to a destination.

[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.200]
You don't give drug addicts drugs to deliver to somebody else. You don't give alcoholics booze to deliver to somebody else.

[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:14.000]
And you don't give sugar, hollage, a bunch of mandal bread to deliver to anybody else without expecting them to consume it on the way there.

[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:21.900]
You know what I'm saying? Ma 10 55 at five. St. Goldberg from the sporting bruised to we got boogster at six o'clock.

[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.600]
Got more major eight out the Neil Roger show.

[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:26.420]
Hey, ma'am.

[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.840]
Praise the call and check out the parking lot.

[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.660]
Here's a mobile implantation. Hello.

[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.420]
Hey, do a nail. Okay, sir.

[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.660]
Question for you. And I've been following the first time calling number one. I just want to ask you one thing.

[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.900]
You're talking about the legalization of marijuana.

[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:47.420]
Where do you draw the line, though, Neil? I mean, you don't want your heart surgeon to be high on drugs.

[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.620]
You don't want your cough, et cetera. How can you make it fair for some people to affect your job? What difference does it make?

[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:59.920]
Why is it anybody's business? Well, I agree with that, but where do you draw the line? I just got through saying how where do you draw the line of people drinking booze?

[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:05.660]
I agree. I agree. It's the same principle. But that's a principle that covers everybody and decides.

[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:10.560]
What do you mean by that? Well, everybody's not supposed to be drinking on the job.

[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:18.120]
Everybody is not supposed to. How many people do you know that are taking booze tests that are taking breathalyzer tests for booze before they do whatever they do?

[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:24.360]
I agree. Good point. Good point. The fact is that there isn't alcohol addictive. Isn't it a drug? Sure. I know.

[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:32.200]
Yeah. So what are we talking about? Why do we single out certain substances that are of verboteninist's side, but other ones are okay because they make a lot of money from it?

[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:40.580]
I agree. But what I understood you were saying is that it was okay for some people. Let's say it's okay for somebody to get high on a Sunday night's party because of the work on money.

[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:47.520]
No, no, what I'm saying to you is that it's nobody's business as long as it affects their job performance. It's nobody's business.

[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:55.720]
But where there are people involved in a few very selective sensitive kinds of occupations where it's very important that they be a sober as a judge.

[00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:06.220]
Then in that case, I think you can make an exception. Okay. I don't think it's a difficult line to draw. I don't think it takes a rocket science is to figure out, you know, what are those sensitive positions?

[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.840]
Well, I think that's a question of who draws the line. What's the sensitive position?

[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:17.900]
Let me ask you this. How many martinis can you go out and have it lunch and then come back? No, seriously. And then come back and do your sensitive job.

[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:23.480]
Whatever the hell it is. How many can you have before you come back after lunch and perform open heart surgery? You can't have it.

[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:30.800]
Yeah. Well, how do we know if they did or they didn't? Well, we don't know. That's the point. That's the whole thing. But you're just drawing a line saying we're just because of that.

[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:38.060]
So I don't understand your point. Aren't you being hypocritical here? So in other words, it's okay for them to go out and we don't know. We're not supposed to know.

[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:46.700]
But if they went out and they smoked a joint during lunch time and sat around with somebody over a cup of coffee or whatever, then they come back. Then we can test them for drugs. No, no, it's not a matter of not.

[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:57.760]
Or they smoke it three months ago and it's still on their bloodstream. Is that the deal? Well, that's the, that's the thing I'm trying to talk to you about. If you're just drawing a line saying just face on somebody's job, they can't get eyes and like where they got to work.

[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:05.160]
It's okay for another fellow to do. Okay. Well, you're repeating it the third time and I think I explained it to have an ice martiniate lunchtime. We have an open line at day two and brown.

[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.660]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line.

[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.000]
11 on 9 at Q way and you feel like.

[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:33.540]
No, no, no. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No

[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:54.980]
No. No. No. No. No. We have two open lines in the date. Fight.

[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.320]
you know he's right i mean uh... it's a very small organization that no i

[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.460]
national organization for the reform of our one-of-a-long

[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.620]
nor can't run around screaming in the link is about ten people with them

[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.700]
and uh... that's about it

[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.300]
now i mean you know they're around but it's a very uh...

[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.480]
and of course your fear that talk about swimming of upstream

[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:15.400]
i mean you're fighting a losing battle pretty much in the society because this

[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.420]
is one of those things that

[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:20.300]
that people are taught it's a given all i mean this is uh... drugs everything is

[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.200]
lumped in as drugs booze that's okay

[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.720]
who's is okay

[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.320]
because it's big-guy-down business okay

[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.960]
in fact if they put the booze out of it they were in fact a pro-wreston

[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.680]
booze all the sports and got a business tomorrow

[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.900]
how can we subsidize all these the jox dollar big salaries if we put but

[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.820]
wise or other business

[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.040]
here's a mobile in my any hello

[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.420]

[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.460]
uh... listen to the last call to you he didn't want to know me all i mean

[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.160]
everything that uh... going on right now

[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.500]
from far to

[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:53.380]
accident

[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.060]
hello i'm listening

[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.300]
uh... from far to the president i mean uh...

[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:02.080]
is just a public i mean the public doesn't care near look at your shoulder

[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:02.480]
past

[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.640]
i mean they don't care

[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:09.080]
and that's where the problem lies i mean like you said if we if we get off

[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.900]
i'll tell you what they care about some of them found out that their seats were

[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.920]
like a half an inch too small of the arena at the new macaroni yesterday

[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.940]
and the phones rang off the hook it was the most incredible money i've ever had

[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:21.620]
on the show for a solid hours of people i'd say ninety eight percent of the

[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.520]
car and you know that's fine you have a right to be chanbellic all the money

[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.380]
you're spending but that's the kind of thing that motivates the people in this

[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.560]
time that's what they get whipped up into a frenzy about

[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.580]
but when it comes to their rights when it comes to basic human freedom

[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.100]
living like a ming

[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.600]
living without being terrorized in a goddamn police state

[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.120]
uh... we don't care about this so we can change anything we don't have the time

[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.320]
and of course when somebody in their family winds up getting uh... fifty three

[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.180]
years in jail because they had too many plants in a backyard or because

[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.340]
somebody planted a bunch of crap in your car where we're now all well now all

[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.060]
of a sudden they care

[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.840]
as long as their asses and being al Gore then they don't give a crap

[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.960]
but somebody else's asses being gourd then uh... who cares

[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.700]
here's a mobile in four-letter hello

[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:09.580]
new yes sir

[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.860]
i want to say i totally agree with what you're what you've been saying about the

[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.800]
the pot i think you can

[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.960]
and all the pot and uh...

[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.820]
for yourself and

[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.640]
do the right thing and make it happen it's nobody's business

[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.220]
yeah i don't think i don't think the uh... politicians will take a very

[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.860]
seriously what do you think about that

[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.520]
on of course they won't because it's uh... considered an american it's like it

[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.200]
would be like having a campaign to legalize prostitution america like it isn't

[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.880]
almost every western european country

[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:41.040]
uh... you can't even have an intelligent discussion about it because it's not

[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.420]
an apple pie go to choose issue and especially where you deal with this right

[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.780]
when congress we got you haven't got a china and chance

[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.200]

it's a good work okay thanks

[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:57.260]
like this episode i mean i could i could spend a lot of time about this

[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:00.140]
episode in larmy wioming in this kid that got lynched there and murdered

[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.640]
this gay college student was all a five foot two and a hundred and nine pounds by

[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.020]
the way

[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.440]
takes a couple of real courageous guys

[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.700]
real good masculine courageous guys to go out there and the beat the livin

[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.600]
stoddard this kid leave him for dead in the cold

[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.800]
which he did die

[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.580]
and of course we have all these good christian zealots coming on their last two

[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.400]
days and for the yesterday on cnn that stupid talkback show

[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.880]
this asshole from the family they always put the word family in there

[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.060]
the family action council the family research council is this one at gerry

[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:32.260]
borne out to the organization

[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.160]
oh well you know we don't need anymore laws we don't need any hate crime laws

[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.780]
because then what you do in his year uh... year your criminalizing people's

[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:40.320]
attitudes

[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.040]
and what they're really saying is then you're putting a crimp in our ability to

[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:47.300]
teach people it's okay to hate gays they black state whichever group we are

[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.980]
uh... is our skate boat for the year

[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.760]
that's what they're really saying

[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.620]
and of course in america try to there is another one of these deals trying to

[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:59.060]
change attitudes law enforcement i mean law enforcement treats gays like

[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.260]
ten-class people in this country just like they treat blacks like ten-class

[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.660]
people and they stay and it's no different than ever was

[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.620]
you can pass all the laws in the world but until you change people's

[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:15.120]
attitudes until you change education until you grow up and stop the hate and

[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.780]
stop the narrow mind of this and stopping a bunch of emotional cripples that's

[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:23.400]
what this card on my campus all about maddie lesham it's a message and the

[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.460]
message is grow up and stopping a god damn child stopping a bunch of emotional

[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:32.100]
cripples that's the message and stopping a bunch of sanctimonious hypocrites

[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:37.640]
and the idea that we got somebody on there who is trying to censor me and try

[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.500]
to censor the message i want to suppose to be a cutting edge revolutionary

[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.480]
television station are you fooling anybody no

[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.540]
you're not fooling even a five-year-old kid out there that would listen to this

[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:53.700]
conversation that somebody wants to censor a message that may be out of the

[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:57.000]
mainstream and you're supposed to be cutting edge and revolutionary and you got a

[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.540]

[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:52.380]
time that they're little kids it doesn't have any titillation factor to them it doesn't mean

[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:57.240]
anything they're mature they're grown up they're exposed to it and it's dealt with openly and

[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:02.060]

[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:07.960]
more apple-eyed and day one and powered five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t

[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:14.620]
wireless line you know what I'm saying yeah I think you do here's plantation hello yes Neil yes

[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:22.640]
I see you like to parody the Jamaica and pension for marijuana yeah but I can tell you something

[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:29.960]
I would be very careful if I were your listeners more can Jamaica and marijuana

[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:42.520]
yes because it is cross contaminated with the spray pile of quatt on the ear right and it is done

[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:47.420]
oh that was that why you're way behind the times fell governor bobby gram was doing that here in

[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:52.480]
florida years and years ago he was killing people with pericot yeah but they do it right now in Jamaica

[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:58.540]
right and what makes it worse maybe that's why those Jamaicans all drive like that man no it's that

[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:05.300]
it's that's why Americans are dropping dead like slides from cancer yeah because what is going on

[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:13.900]
is that it drifts on the winds the power quad and I can tell you because I have a farm nearby and

[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:19.840]
nearby where a farmer nearby where nearby here is where they grow marijuana and a loud scale

[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:29.480]
and my crops wither and die right so therefore that stuff is bad news and I can tell you American

[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:37.060]
I've died like flies from smoking to Jamaican marijuana yeah maybe it's a bloodless cool okay that's all

[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:43.240]
the more recent we got to grow our own sir maybe you're right okay there you go okay well don't

[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:49.640]
don't be so much anymore bad crap and thanks a lot I'm sitting in my studio at WNWS WS news doing

[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:55.020]
that serious horrendous topical talk and I started the thing and this is when governor bob gram

[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.980]
started a pericot thing and I said I guess everybody's going to have to start being their own farmers

[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:03.280]
growing their own backyard all you people want to smoke the wicked weed out there because the governor

[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:09.040]
wants to poison you and so I started a campaign it was a joke just like the cards on the cap

[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:15.340]
are a joke it was it was a spoof it was called seeds for the seedy I said everybody out there

[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.160]
sent us all your pot seeds we're gonna have to start well we'll start our own goddamn uh

[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:25.680]
gigantic farm down here in the ranch and now wherever somewhere and so sure enough people

[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:30.720]
started sending in seeds and one day one day I'm sitting in a studio I've got what is obviously

[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:38.440]
a bottle of bird seed hearts mountain bird seed yellow you know the shape of bird seed does it

[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.740]
look anything at all like marijuana seed oh no so I can see you know it a bottle of bird seed

[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:48.420]
and Luke Cron are hysterical general manager who inherited the job a glorified sales guy when

[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.840]
Dick Casper went off the Nashville Luke Cron inherited the job as general manager

[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:59.720]
and the best part of the deal is Tom Jicca was there that day from the old Miami news I guess

[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:05.480]
Tom was working for in those days and he was writing an article about this story or about

[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:11.200]
whatever something about the show and Luke Cron during a commercial break opens up the door to my

[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.460]
studio and says to Tom Tom I'm gonna have to ask you to leave for a minute I gotta talk to him

[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.440]
Tom goes out in the hallway and of course there they the walls were almost as paper thin as they are

[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:24.980]
here and Luke Cron lights into me what are you gonna do if you lost your mind you're gonna lose

[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:28.840]
our license sounded just like Maddie Lasham and he put his eyes weren't darting around as much like a

[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:40.180]
rodent out of control out of his mind making a major song of dance about bird seed a bottle of

[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:47.520]
hearts mountain unlabeled bird seed and we were gonna lose the station's license according to

[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:52.580]
mr. Cron I was gonna lose it for them because I had a bottle of bird seed that would be like my

[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:56.880]
saying I'm sitting here smoking one right now you know what I am I'm sitting here smoking right now

[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:04.040]
am I not yes you are I got one in my mouth right now clenched between my teeth

[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:11.100]
grown in the ground mm-hmm well there it is of course it doesn't happen to be put it happens to be

[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:15.380]
a Pradomo reserve from our friends in Nixigars a great cigar my favorite in the world now these are

[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:20.780]
great they're they're the best but Luke Cron would probably have come running down the stairs if he

[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:26.120]
heard me say I'm smoking one right now oh my god we're gonna lose our license hysterical just like

[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:32.900]
somebody we know over there at whammy maniacs because this is the you know what it is when you

[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:37.480]
read it come right down to with this hysteria this juvenile behavior that's the American way

[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:43.800]
amen sweet heart you said it here's a mobile in western hello ill yes sir yeah you had a real

[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:48.460]
difficult time with the bird seed but lesbian dilatant it was okay right right do you remember that

[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:53.080]
well not on my show oh was it whatever you know what I'm talking about yeah right that

[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.880]
well whatever the dating show the dating and mating and raping sure right that that said the

[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.720]
funny thing about it is that I was listening to what you were talking about before I have a son

[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.460]
who is in six gradies in middle school which I think is ridiculous to be putting six graders in

[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:10.280]
middle school but that's another show um he went to his first school dance on Friday night uh-huh

[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:15.780]
and it wasn't until he went to that dance and came home as a six-grader that he started asking me

[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:22.520]
about what's the fact what's an n-word what's it this what's it that and it's amazing you're not

[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:27.800]
gonna change the American people because the American people are educating their kids to act this way

[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.380]
and while I have a very open relationship with him if he has any questions he knows he can come to

[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.920]
me he can ask me because I'd rather he asked me to look like a jerk in front of his friends yeah

[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:40.480]
and the fact of the matter is what he came home I was like most of the time he comes home and my

[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.500]
girlfriend and I look at each other go always in that queue what he's asking but some of the stuff

[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:49.020]
he was coming home and asking on Friday after that dance was appalling and I don't know what can

[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:52.120]
be done about it I don't know where it is it's gonna start at home and that's why it never is

[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:57.580]
gonna change because nobody is gonna start at home everybody I honestly believe genuinely feels like

[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:01.020]
this is the way they want it to be they're always gonna hate these people they're always gonna

[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:05.060]
hate those people and the most disgusting part about it is the passing it under their kids so what do

[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:10.160]
you do well what do you do it all depends on your upbringing that's where it's got to come from

[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:14.620]
the the school can do it the churches in the city guys they're obviously not doing a very good

[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:18.020]
job but in fact the churches are doing a good job of the opposite of teaching people to hate

[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.600]
each other because they believe different bullcrap I wouldn't involve my son in parochial school

[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.780]
of the meant my life well what forget it but it's just the fact is that in elementary school everything

[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:31.220]
is very antiseptic and he has all different kinds of colors and creeds of friends and it was

[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:35.560]
like a culture shock it's very scary as a parent it's very scary and as a person it's very scary

[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:40.580]
yeah well that's where the parents got it you know grab it by the bootstraps man you're the only one

[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:46.760]
Scott the opportunity but we have two overlapped this line remember the day that we had

[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:51.580]
AJ and Kevin in here from the back street boys even though you don't like their music and I was

[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:54.540]
talking to them about the fact that they travel all over the world and how big their music was

[00:44:54.540 --> 00:45:00.380]
etc in Europe and then we're talking about how great Amsterdam was now these are kids that are from

[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:07.200]
Kentucky Orlando West Palm Beach and Tampa who grew up in very ultra religious knee into thought

[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:12.920]
backgrounds and what do they say that it was a breath of fresh air how fantastic they found it over

[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:17.100]
there because the people were so much more enlightened and the kids were so like light years ahead

[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:21.160]
of American kids because of their realistic and open and honest attitudes about sex and drugs

[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:26.680]
and every other goddamn thing as opposed to the Stone Age American thing that's the American

[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:34.680]
way right here's Miami hello hello Neil yes sir congratulations on bringing up this subject

[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:40.220]
probably I'd also like to mention though that one of your authors Peter McGrubbingham's the author

[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:45.720]
has been released from jail on a quarter million dollars bail finally really from jail for what

[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:52.980]
oh conspiracy to grow marijuana he suffers from AIDS and non-Hopkins Hodgkins lymphoma

[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:58.340]
and was uh... planning out in California under their medical marijuana compassionate uh...

[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:05.340]
miracle marijuana uh... to conspiracy to grow marijuana he'd actually grow any and he hadn't

[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:11.640]
given any away sold distributed or anything else but he was charged with conspiracy so for

[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:16.800]
quarter of a million dollars his family finally bailed them out oh my god yeah it was 19 pounds

[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:23.400]
and jailed it wasn't just denied his AIDS medication or yeah but i said that's the American way

[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:28.040]
that's right yes sir uh... i'm surprised that you don't go further and just we've got to end

[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:32.360]
this next thing you know we're gonna have a 40 story uh... 40 story told uh... you know

[00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:55.870]
make some sense that agree with maddie lesham to think that this is the worst possible thing that we

[00:46:55.870 --> 00:47:00.490]
could do is send any message to our kids that marijuana might not be evil that maybe that

[00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:03.070]
refer madness when just a little bit too far perhaps

[00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:06.350]
are there any of those people out there no

[00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:08.750]

[00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:17.770]
legalized and all that stuff we should be sitting here raising hell about the alcohol industry

[00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:24.950]
and getting that uh censored because that's what getting it censored it's no not censored

[00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:31.310]
it's what you said it should not be uh shut down our throats advertised on every medium

[00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:40.330]
available and that that kills more kids than we'd whatever even think of yeah and the

[00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:45.170]
alcohol industry and cleaning up this uh country mm-hmm that's my how are you going to do that

[00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:49.810]
the same way that you're going to get probably legalized i'm not going to get pot so i'm not

[00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:56.190]

sixty and pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line it's a saint it's the same thing with guns

[00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:16.430]
there's nothing inherently wrong with guns just that when you put guns in the hands of people that

[00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:22.970]
are juvenile and irresponsible then then you got a problem and Americans as a people are too

[00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:29.270]
emotionally immature and irresponsible to have guns Americans as a people are too emotionally

[00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:33.930]
irresponsible to be drink at all is booze and going out there and driving and killing each other

[00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:41.630]

[00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:46.150]
back to social morais it goes back to education there is no education in america

[00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:50.950]

love Jimmy you know his restaurant's pretty good but uh not one thing a lot of people forget in

[00:58:56.490 --> 00:59:00.150]
the middle of all this is that the dolphin payroll is the third lowest in the NFL and to the fine

[00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:04.070]
figure a wane is in the middle of this again well see for some reason with the marlin's of course

[00:59:04.070 --> 00:59:08.310]
he i mean totally clean house there but uh and the same with the panthers they didn't spend a lot

[00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:11.950]
of money any money on free agents but with a dolphin it doesn't get any publicity but he's got

[00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:16.430]
the third lowest payroll in the whole NFL uh oh and there's that that's not shocking you know i mean

[00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:20.810]
the guy doesn't do it like a blockbuster cockbuster i mean sorry uh that that place is doing

[00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:24.610]
nothing right point that and yeah speaker them you know i got a problem with weighing with that yeah

[00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:29.250]
i could i returned a video to them about a month ago they said that i read uh that i couldn't run a

[00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:33.350]
video and i said well how do i run video about two weeks ago oh i don't know why that happened

[00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:40.530]
problem with that you know and you're not even charging me the full amount of uh yeah what the

[00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:44.830]
thing is wrong with that exactly you know and they say and the bottom line is yeah and the reason

[00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:48.750]
they said is because oh it wasn't here when we get our inventory i said well you got a bunch of

[00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:53.630]
teenage kids there stealing the things for so by drugs and stuff like that yeah you know and she didn't

[01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:43.210]
cap and the show on TV and i i thought to myself you know and i even told Tom jikko this i said

[01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:47.370]
many lesham isn't smart enough to pull off a publicity stunt okay and that's a guy named truth

[01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:52.330]
in addition to which these postcards have been here for months and there was never any issue about

[01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:55.570]
it until all of a sudden out of the corner of his eye one day when he wasn't busy banging somebody

[01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:58.730]
over there a whammy he happened to see the show and oh gee you can't have that on here

hello yes man how you doing great hey i just wanted to call him thank you for covering this issue

[01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:21.950]
i'm surprised to see you do it because i know how you feel about drug use yeah uh but i don't

[01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:26.650]
consider people at smoked pot to be drug use well i don't either but you know you've said about a

[01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:31.030]
dozen times now don't smoke dope or you go down the toilet anyway i wanted to thank you for that but

[01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:35.410]
i also want to point out that i think you're missing a big part of the picture yes uh that is

[01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:40.830]
you're talking about uh the infringement on freedom which are you know of course it's a very

[01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:46.310]
important issue but have you thought about the effect the prohibition actually has as opposed to

[01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:52.990]
the effect that it was intended to have meaning what well you know they're trying to keep everybody

[01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:59.090]
from smoking pot but what actually happens is uh you know punks like Pablo Escobar become multi-millionaires

[01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:04.030]
and alcapones yeah what's the current one career well but that's that's maybe you didn't hear me read

[01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:09.070]
that article that's what that article was all about well that was that was the point that was

[01:04:09.070 --> 01:04:13.590]
the whole point is that it creates a black market as soon as you make something illegal it creates

[01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:18.150]
a tremendous black market and you become partners with organized crime and disorganized okay

[01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:22.890]
i i'm staying corrected you don't know if anything i'm on top of it well thank you okay have a great

[01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:27.990]

[01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:25.210]
that black gooey smarmy dreck that to carry a cup around with them or a can or something like that

[01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:32.070]
and spit in it when they're in the house something in a little portable spit tune yeah they carry a

[01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:38.150]

[01:13:45.570 --> 01:13:52.990]
cheek char or the snooze the what the W snooze i thought they were off the air the snooze well what is

[01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:57.910]

[01:14:18.450 --> 01:14:24.670]
way to chan tobacco okay we're making some very serious progress here today suck it in and hold it

[01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:30.370]

[01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:48.350]
brands got it first here's Miami hello hello yes sir well i have a little bit of a problem my oldest son

[01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:54.850]
and his son who's happened to be 16 years old living Chicago yes and he called me up about two three

[01:14:54.850 --> 01:15:02.350]
weeks ago and he said that how would you handle this situation well he found his son smoking grass

[01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:07.890]
and he said but what can i do i smoke too i can't tell him not to

[01:15:08.730 --> 01:15:13.110]
well that was his son stealing his stuff no no no no that's good not what's left nothing

[01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:18.630]
worst that when your kids steal your stuff oh yes no nothing whatsoever but if he this young kid he

[01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:26.050]
16 years old he was brought up to be an athlete yeah this whole idea is to play varsity when he

[01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:32.270]
goes to college yeah now i am afraid and my son is afraid that he might be tested for mario

[01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:39.510]
one or something like that yeah so what's the best suggestion is best suggestions uh get him

[01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:43.070]

[01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:42.010]
empty i file together for you and just waiting in the woods to a stick it to you yeah you're

[01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:47.530]
do you know i don't know if you remember it remember back and then it had to be a case this

[01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:54.330]
the midi just before the fall russia kids used to write to russia to get stamps just to get

[01:19:54.330 --> 01:19:58.670]
allowed these stamp back in those stamp collectors yeah they would get FBI files on because they

[01:19:58.670 --> 01:20:03.930]
wrote to russia i mean yeah the company is union but they would get FBI files automatically because

[01:20:03.930 --> 01:20:06.930]
they wrote to the service that's what i think was the case with leha reoswell i don't think

[01:20:06.930 --> 01:20:10.130]
he ever was in russia i think you just had a stamp collection yeah i think you just want them

[01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:14.990]

[01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:35.570]
if you got neilson meters anyway so that's not a ratings thing i hate to break the news to all those

[01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:38.890]
critics out there and think this is a job to hype the ratings forget that it's hopeless

[01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:43.490]
but because there's a message in here and then you'll be able to see this postcard from amsterdam

[01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:47.610]
that there's been all this big tumult about that had somebody having a nervous breakdown

[01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:54.450]
over there with his turkeys towel here's miramar hello yeah how's it going okay sir

[01:20:54.450 --> 01:21:00.210]
all right i don't want to address the snuff issue yeah uh the first thing is the one thing

[01:21:00.210 --> 01:21:05.490]
that it does the guards and the threats don't do yeah there's no second hand smoke you're

[01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:10.290]
doing it to your own body you're absolutely correct i never thought about that good point

[01:21:10.290 --> 01:21:18.070]
and you know i have an outside job i play softball a lot and it's an environment it's been around yes

[01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:23.090]
it's a nasty habit oh there's no doubt but you know but does anybody get there and they could

[01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:29.370]
be done what does that irritate the hell out of the linings your mouth on so far no it's great for

[01:21:29.370 --> 01:21:36.110]
your teeth but terrible for your guns but and on the marijuana i'm a former 20 year marijuana

[01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:43.510]
user but had to get out of it because of the again i work in a paramutual industry and they have

[01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:49.110]
drug testing uh-huh but as far as the snuff goes you'd have to say people have always played on

[01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:56.330]
right like your cigars do and i think incident the cancer was probably equal to oral cancer for

[01:21:56.450 --> 01:22:01.210]
the guards but you're not there's no second hand you're doing it to yourself you're not doing it

[01:22:01.210 --> 01:22:05.050]
to anybody else and i guess you could do it on a plane if you had your own little spatuna i've done

[01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:11.570]
that have you really yes i have people can't smoke i've been able to get my nicotine fix like i said

[01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:14.890]
i'm starting to get into this thanks a lot pal all right okay good luck now although i'm not

[01:22:14.890 --> 01:22:19.410]
in the nicotine that's why don't you nobody in hell cigars do they they do oh jeez you got to be

[01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:25.410]
crazy to inhale a stogie no nicotine no stogie you can keep sucking on from out don't cause come

[01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:30.310]
on the mnemonic of it there ain't no nicotine in them we have an open-line and proud five six seven

[01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:34.850]
oh five sixty i mean i i don't want to stand like a judge metal because like i'm trying to say

[01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:40.290]
do no harm do your own thing but if i'm sitting next to somebody on an airplane like especially on

[01:22:40.290 --> 01:22:44.570]
a long trip and they got a big charge the back of the room and it's like starting to run down

[01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:50.210]
your chin you know a little bit and the to bend the to back of juice too and now they're starting to

[01:22:50.210 --> 01:22:54.350]
like they they got a little tin cup or something you know like that in the middle of the plane it's a

[01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:59.030]
little bit unappetizing is what i would say then you've got the guys that brag about swallowing

[01:22:59.550 --> 01:23:02.370]
well we don't want to get that on this show this is a different kind of a show

[01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:08.850]
we have an open-line and date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line

[01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:12.850]
maybe years ago i might have considered that not anymore okay i'm sorry not with the kind of

[01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:18.530]
stuff that's going around these days here's a mobile in west palm beach hello yeah deal yes sir

[01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:22.610]
i got it here and i got this connect from my mobile phone okay here's my x-wrap my

[01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:26.810]
little right thank god you got back under i thought that you went to hell on a hand basket no no

[01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:31.390]
came out we when they had to take that to be about three years old we decided you know this

[01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:36.030]
this probably we shouldn't be doing that so we look just we quit and it was probably like

[01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:41.290]
giving up beating chocolate chip cookie oh we we decided not to do it anymore because we had

[01:23:41.290 --> 01:23:46.370]
the kid and each of us and maybe a year later we'd be at a party and someone passed a joint and

[01:23:46.370 --> 01:23:52.030]
we you know we shared a joint okay no problem and that's been what a kid's by radio to college now

[01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:59.490]
now also i gave up cigarette smoking after 20 some years that was hell oh yeah and on top of that

[01:23:59.490 --> 01:24:03.030]
well that's because of nicotine is highly addictive people have a much much tougher time

[01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:07.450]
giving up cigarette smoking that smoking weed yeah and then on top of that i'm an alcoholic

[01:24:07.450 --> 01:24:12.210]
that hasn't had a drink of six years uh-huh but i i couldn't get that up without i mean that was

[01:24:12.210 --> 01:24:16.990]
that was really how right so so i've been i've been around so let me say it again the highly

[01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:23.130]
addictive things nicotine sugar and alcohol those are the three dangerous highly addictive things

[01:24:23.130 --> 01:24:28.370]
and then they're all legal yeah if my son is is done college next year if he should come to me and say

[01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:34.690]

at five sixty wqm you're bashing for the nineties forget about those balls at tv stations that we

[01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:26.410]
have any in this town no hey talk about wild blood from color richer wherever he was said he was

[01:28:26.410 --> 01:28:31.130]
going to disagree and then by the time we got done he was he really wasn't disagree about the

[01:28:31.130 --> 01:28:36.390]
decriminalization or legalization marijuana is there one person in this audience who can give us

[01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:42.970]
one valid reason why they marijuana laws in this country make any sense no we had one yet so far

[01:28:42.970 --> 01:28:49.150]
today no i'm waiting that's the challenge okay that's the Pepsi one challenge by the way if you

[01:28:49.150 --> 01:28:54.150]
try Pepsi one yet oh that's right you don't want it because it's a diet thing i do it diet

[01:28:54.150 --> 01:28:58.310]
from drinking it right now oh Pepsi one is there a new uh they haven't you read about that

[01:28:59.510 --> 01:29:04.650]
it's diet but it's uh supposed to take what is it got in it it does have caffeine don't they have

[01:29:04.650 --> 01:29:09.790]
caffeine free i don't want caffeine uh and that's another thing by the way since we're so concerned

[01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:13.630]
about marijuana and everybody's supposedly so hopped up instead of being mellowed out which is what

[01:29:13.630 --> 01:29:17.750]
they really are but how i want all these caffeine people out there let's outlaw coffee

[01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:24.090]
i don't i say yeah i don't drink coffee see if we're going to do everything based on our own personal

[01:29:24.090 --> 01:29:28.330]
if we're going to do this uh very introspective selfish kind of crappy americans they're famous for

[01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:34.290]
doing see i don't smoke pot so for me to be talking about this at least i can be objective i don't

[01:29:34.290 --> 01:29:40.030]
have any special ask to grind here and i don't drink coffee so like i said scurry up your hooked on

[01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:47.610]
caffeine no but that's the point that that's the whole point caffeine is a stimulant it makes people

[01:29:47.610 --> 01:29:52.890]
behave erratically they get hopped up especially so let's limit people if you have more than two cups

[01:29:52.890 --> 01:29:57.590]
are caffeinated coffee a day or more than two sodas because we remember those people at the other

[01:29:57.590 --> 01:30:03.330]
place that were drinking all that caffeinated soda oh yeah right out of the bottle i'll never forget

[01:30:03.330 --> 01:30:07.970]
i only once in my life did i ever have a program director who used to sit at his desk drinking

[01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:13.710]
caffeinated diet soda out of a bottle out of the big two liter but not with a cup not with a glass

[01:30:13.710 --> 01:30:22.710]
real classy out of the bottle a caffeine junky baby because it's after the a a you go to the

[01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:31.770]

[01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:15.930]
normal okay the commercial comes on everything fades off the buy and cracks up ten decibels easy

[01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:21.190]

[01:31:21.190 --> 01:31:25.830]

[01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:40.690]
up or just move out of another channel which is what everybody does yeah you can go over to the

[01:31:40.690 --> 01:31:44.330]

[01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:58.670]
AC uh i don't care it's 25 to two anyway somebody up here on this uh second floor

[01:31:58.670 --> 01:32:03.210]
keeps messing around with the air conditioning back there keeps putting their little fingers on a

[01:32:03.210 --> 01:32:09.370]
damn thing like i've said before if it's too hot if it's too cold you can walk out in the hallway

[01:32:09.370 --> 01:32:13.730]
and get an elevator go downstairs you can go upstairs smooth with the people up there on the third

[01:32:13.730 --> 01:32:18.650]
floor all the management people uh you can do whatever you want i'm a captive audience here in this room

[01:32:18.650 --> 01:32:22.810]
four hours every day i haven't been up out of this chair oh yeah i took a leak that's the one for

[01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:27.230]

[01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:32.970]
and they keep dicking with our air conditioning out there in the hallway and i wouldn't be surprised

[01:32:32.970 --> 01:32:37.570]
in the least bit if it's some of our sales holes up here because just like Hank was saying yesterday

[01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:42.270]
and boy he's right on target beyond the shadow of a doubt sales people are ice holes makes no mistake

[01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:52.790]
about it there's something about i i think Hank was talking about how he used to sell what was

[01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:56.690]
it was when he first came down here and how slimy and unclean he felt what i got out of the

[01:32:56.690 --> 01:33:00.990]
better he wanted just because he was a sales hole that's right there's something just naturally

[01:33:00.990 --> 01:33:06.170]
slimy and slippery although it's a matter of degree i mean most sales holes aren't as slimy and

[01:33:06.170 --> 01:33:12.030]
slippery as giri sarner for who came in this morning and tried to pedal me some copy did you see that

what am i'm getting carried away here's plantation hello thank you for taking my call thank you

[01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:48.330]
for making your call sir what's interesting about this whammy situation is the fact that a progressive

[01:33:48.330 --> 01:33:54.550]
station like whammy yes you did which is a progressive format that they were doing right and simply

[01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:59.510]
built it up and then destroy you piece by piece uh-huh which makes no sense that they would be

[01:33:59.510 --> 01:34:04.310]
before destroying their own uh credibility in their own station exactly why would they do that now

[01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:09.670]
they have three rewans of mass that they advertise on build boards is five four four really four

[01:34:09.670 --> 01:34:13.970]
four and they got and they're seven o'clock news runs three times now seven eight and

[01:34:13.970 --> 01:34:20.410]
nine o'clock the same news case over ask a repeat from a hundred years ago this is the monsters the

[01:34:20.410 --> 01:34:25.910]
monsters so what grandpa's in verisperial luis is ready to sue me once that off the earth what happened

[01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:30.650]
to the progress of this is a station i mean with you that was the start of the foundation see

[01:34:30.650 --> 01:34:35.110]
anybody can come in and talk a big game but you know if if you're not qualified if you're not

[01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:39.230]
competent then they get a couple of phone calls they get a couple letters they take a little bit of

[01:34:39.230 --> 01:34:43.250]
heat right and uh and all of a sudden they start caving in because they're not ready for prime time

[01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:47.470]
and i'm certainly not ready for this show i'll tell you that it's truth they bleeped too out on

[01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:51.370]
every one and then for this guy to come in a paper and say i would never censor Neil while they're

[01:34:51.370 --> 01:34:56.390]
putting leaf at least and stuff that's already bleeped and all right that's why people got fed up

[01:34:56.390 --> 01:35:00.190]
and stopped watching the show yeah the beach they took the best parts out of each year show

[01:35:00.190 --> 01:35:05.230]
exactly they rendered the meaningless that's right so i can't figure out now why they're so upset and

[01:35:05.230 --> 01:35:09.650]
star about this whole situation i mean what was the whole point of this you tell me all right

[01:35:09.790 --> 01:35:13.470]
anyway thank you you had a great show in the radio show you know it's still number one

[01:35:13.470 --> 01:35:18.170]

[01:35:32.710 --> 01:35:37.250]

[01:35:58.450 --> 01:36:03.250]
game but it got to get by the first winning and how he did pitch well one other thing real quick
