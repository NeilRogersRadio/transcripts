[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020]
Lower it out your ass. So even though here in Florida, I mean we knew that the Jeopardy was gonna be the governor because you know

[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.320]
You run a dead man against them if they were on a real candidate

[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.580]
It could have been pretty goddamn interesting, you know what in spite of all those Cubans devoted for Bush

[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.480]
Come on each step come on each this same old crap and you know the sad part about this whole thing is

[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.240]
That is great as magnificent of an evening as it was around the country for those people who are to the left of a tiller behind

[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.280]
You can't you can't find out what else going on the coverage of this between the newspapers

[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.500]
Which evidently go to bed like the old people but like nine o'clock at night in this town and then watching this morning

[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.580]
You know we start Chuck Schumer a little bit this morning Barbara Boxer a little bit of this a little too much newt

[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.000]
Gingrich but what did we sell it is calm mostly brown you're out sweetie

[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.840]
But what did we see on every network on every newscast?

[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.640]
What was the only reference to even there being an election yesterday made on the rest of this radio station as in this morning coming to work?

[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.460]
Jesse the body Ventura

[00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.080]
There you go governor Minnesota

[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:08.040]
He has been on I guarantee he's been on more than Newt Gingrich more than the dickhead heart more than the Bubba more than all these other people put together

[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.380]
The winners the losers the other side is Jesse the body Ventura the media you people are crazy. I mean, it's a cute story, you know, it's interesting

[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.460]
But is that is that the big story of what happened yesterday in the election? Oh Jesus Christ in the Sarah man

[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.420]
Jesse the body Ventura is it there you go?

[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.860]
Because the media I'll give you an example last night. I'm watching CBS news as I do every night 6 30 on Channel 4

[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.700]
And Dan rather says breathlessly and we're gonna be back and start making some calls right after you know after the break 7 o'clock

[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.160]
There's a poll close including Florida

[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.640]
7 o'clock does Channel 4 stick with this CBS? No, I flip over to Channel 10 today stick with a

[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.540]
little because we got to get inside edition or whatever the puff

[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.560]
Tabloid news stories on four and they got to get squeal of fortune there on 10

[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.640]
So I have to start dealing with my big satellite dish and find a CBS affiliate and

[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.240]
The first thing they're announcing is a jet bush wins in Florida are the local stations reporting this at 7 o'clock

[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.560]
No, no because they're too busy with their usual with deco drive and with whatever they're putting on their bunch of crap

[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.760]
You people in the media and for example, oh look at this look at that read one Senate in Nevada by about like two votes

[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.540]
Harry Reid but does and I'm trying to find stuff out this morning and I'm watching all these guys damn shows

[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.500]
I'm looking at these newspapers which are useless because like I said they went to bed a hundred hours ago

[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.680]
So I know the medical marijuana thing passed in Vegas in Nevada. That's the only one I can find out

[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.160]
That's the other did it pass in California. I don't know

[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.680]
Or the district of Columbia or in Alaska while the other states was out about I have no idea

[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.400]
Did Bob Dornin lose which your put were hoping praying in California? Don't know

[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.180]
Do know that the Democrats picked up five maybe six seats in the house the Senate is a wash

[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.420]
Republicans who are gonna pick up five or six gets it they picked up nothing 55 45 just the way it was

[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.200]
And in state after state all amount of God damn country the message was just say no to the right wing extremist okay

[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.140]
for example like right here in Florida

[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.760]
On that equal rights measure on the ballot revision number nine

[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.160]
They're all poor David Katen over there with a Florida Fist

[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.440]
Association in the Tampa he's all bent out of shape

[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.880]
Because they were leading the that's right the Tampa based Florida family association lobbied hard against the measure in part because they feel the

[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.020]
Constitutional change makes it easier for gays to challenge state laws against gay marriage even though it says absolutely nothing about that

[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.680]
And there's nothing to do with that they also said the amendment was unnecessary because women were already protected by the Constitution

[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.120]
David Katen blamed the defeat on the amendment's language which he believes is misleading

[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.660]
Who's gonna vote against something called basic rights? He said we knew we had an uphill battle most people don't have the depth of

[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.500]
Understanding of what this amendment could do. He said his group would lobby the legislature next year to clarify that amendment number nine

[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.260]
Should not be legally interpreted to country the current marriage laws

[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.260]
And you know what they'll lose again just like they do all the time David Katen and his little group of 50 old misfits over there in the West Coast

[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.180]
the Florida fifth

[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.600]
Association whatever the FFA is

[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.180]
And amendment number 12 there on the gun on the gun shows and all that other bullcrack

[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.580]
Past overwhelmingly again

[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.520]
There you go

[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.080]
But trying to really find out some serious meaningful information out there is almost impossible because they're all worked up into a frenzy about

[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.940]
Jesse DeBot even sure there you go

[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.420]
The big news story

[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.740]
We just had a major election here which usually these midterm elections aren't that important

[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.380]
But this one comes in the middle of this semana cagate and all the other crap that's going on and the attempted bloodless crew by a bunch of right wing lunatics

[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.280]
Self identified as the Christian coalition whatever they are for a bit of crazy goyam

[00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:03.560]
And it's interesting like in North Carolina where Edwards beat the anxious lock faircloth there the incumbent whose good buddies with the Ken star

[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.380]
That's 23% of the born again Christians the uh

[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.260]
Christian coalition voted for the Democrat there

[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.120]
So just like the FFA like the Florida fifth

[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.260]
Association these are people who like to exaggerate not that they would ever lie of course because we know that they're good Christian

[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.440]
But like to exaggerate their numbers and their clout

[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.360]
So that's the one thing to hang on to in this country is that as long as we still have free elections

[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.140]
The overwhelming majority of people in all of the country

[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.880]
Just saying no to a Christian can tell them to blow it out the rest like Bob Decker said this morning

[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.060]
Just blow it out your ass stick it. We don't want nothing to do with you. You're not going to tell everybody how to live go to hell

[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.900]
To which we say all right

[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.800]
Nine minutes after 10 to 560 WQM

[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.680]
You tried the minutes after 10 to 560 WQM

[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.440]
So they're probably going to be people say well, you know, we wasted our time yesterday

[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.140]
We ran out there and voted and bush still one but you know something that was a good good practice

[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.980]
Real good practice

[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.960]
Good example for to go out there and get off you dead ass and not just let's say a lot of bunch of farbic and a right wing lunatics one your god damn life

[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.200]
Because come to year 2000. I mean the Democrats have picked up at five maybe six seats in the house and

[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.660]
Bubba didn't go in anywhere, okay?

[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.760]
So I hate to break the news to Ken star and Newt King rich and Trent lot and all these other Nazis

[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.040]
But he's not going anywhere

[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.700]
But to give you the idea of my frustration see these I realized the newspapers have a deadline

[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.800]
They got to go to bed by a certain length of time

[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.360]
But Jesus Christ here's a brilliant article in the herald no less and the herald was far ahead of the sunset

[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.760]
The sunset no must have put the bed about eight o'clock last night. They put the paper to bed

[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.420]
Because they wouldn't even really have even on the front page

[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.000]
They don't have the thrust of the whole story

[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.900]
64 years since there was a midterm election when the party in power in the

[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.880]
Well the White House actually gains seats and didn't lose seats in the midterm election

[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.920]
64 years since that's happened did I find any answers?

[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.440]
No nothing and I'm still watching here and you can bet I'm guarantee if you're a big wrestling fan

[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.000]
Just turn the TV on okay flip the channels every 20 minutes on it right on down that little tone okay as soon as you

[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.100]
That's the one you'll see Jesse the body Ventura

[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.160]
Because that's what the media figures into message out of the election last night

[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.720]
Let me say it again you people in the media wasn't bad enough what you've done with this penis gate and just upset

[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.260]
26 hours a day

[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.740]
That's not bad enough

[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.920]
But now we got a professional wrestler who looks like he just came off a guy named spaceship who is the governor of Minnesota

[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.540]
First of all who gives the crap about Minnesota when you come right down to it. Is anybody care? No

[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.100]
Should anybody care? No

[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.980]
Although he is for legalized prostitution. Let's hear it for Jesse. Hi there you go legalized prostitution

[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:54.820]
And he's still one even with all those the good Swedes up there those Nazis in Minnesota with their blonde here in blue eyes. Oh, they look good

[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.360]
So does anybody in this audience can you give me an answer on the Al Al a gutman

[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.700]
Who is very popular in little Havana like anybody else?

[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.040]
No matter what kind of a criminal they may be as long as they got the right last name and they speak at a panny

[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:13.220]
60 some percent of the Cuban population voter you see look at other states like California

[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.900]
75 percent of the Hispanics voted for Barbara boxer and for the governor there mr. Bordam

[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.340]
But they're not in Florida Hispanic in fact blacks

[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:27.840]
Choose women and non-cuban Hispanics all over America voted overwhelming re-democratic

[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.740]
How do you like that? I'm gays all fags. He's got to put them in there too. Why not?

[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:39.040]
So where we have the problem is we have like the wasp mails out there across America who just can't get it

[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.660]
Well, they like Jesse the body though because that's that macho thing, you know

[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.960]
And then we have the Cubans in they cut it come on Easter come on Easter

[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.280]
for it and they're never gonna change their hopeless

[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.280]
not all just most

[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.380]
Here's a mobile in pompano hello

[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.580]
Yeah, you know, it's funny, you know, you talk about the segments

[00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.600]
You just named it voted and you know blacks to what they scared to crap out of them down here in Carolina

[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.420]
Saying they're gonna have burning crosses in your front yard

[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:09.700]
Yeah, let me tell you this what did the democrats done for the blast still can't read they can't talk

[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.980]
And no, and then you sound like you're doing a real good job, too. Mike illiterate racist friend

[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:20.320]
There you go. He's all bent out of shape. You better get used to a pal because you're out. Okay, you and your real if you're all out

[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.820]
You had your day and you blew it

[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:31.320]
Because you were too busy worried about who was blowing it in the White House instead of worried about taking care of business and taking care of real issues that people care about

[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:37.120]
So you can badmouth all you want black so this group for that group forever to how you want the fact is you lose

[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.560]
There's our first call today. It's good one open-minded, broder to and date five six seven oh five sixty

[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.200]
Tom five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.680]
My good redneck friend like I said those are the ones we have the problems with the redneck

[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.100]
Wasp mail in America a lot of problems with them getting at a message

[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.080]
Because they don't like nobody

[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.340]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello

[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.100]
You know, hi my battery's about to crap out, but if you're looking for good

[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.020]
Electroresults you go to your computer

[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:12.600]
MSNBC. Well, I can't do that now. Why can't MSNBC put it on their guy then television station instead of having

[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.880]
I'm sitting there stick out pen and there's nose this morning and putting chewing gum on the side of his face

[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.960]
Why can't they have the election returns on it and like put it on a on a school there?

[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.100]
So you can see and then instead of waiting through 55 interviews with Jesse the body Ventura

[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:31.720]
Because they suck but last night as a two o'clock medical marijuana was passing pretty easily in

[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.340]
Washington

[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.320]
Colorado

[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.240]
And Nevada right

[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.080]
I did not see the last results because they were coming up late now. What about California?

[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.760]
I think it was I didn't know that it was on in California. Yes, it was I thought it was being reauthorized and eric

[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.540]
No, it was on the ballot. Let me say it again. It was definitely on the ballot in California

[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.400]
And it was on in DC too, right?

[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.240]
Yeah, but are we going to know about those?

[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.580]
Well, if you got somebody got access to a computer go to MSNBC

[00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.480]
You can look at every result for every state valid initiative, etc

[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.280]
Okay, all right. Thanks

[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.060]
There you go. So we got to get what?

[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.040]
Did you get the answer on Dornin and Gutman? No

[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.660]
Dorn in law. Oh Dornin lost again. Oh, that's it. Won't be screaming about voter fraud

[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:19.120]
There's that he's out Nazi a card carrying hail Hitler son of a bick's Nazi is out for good

[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.220]
Take him out of him and and cut him one by 299 votes

[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:26.900]
You

[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.160]
Gutman won by 290 votes

[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.360]
Because the crazy crazy right wing we hate fidel

[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.180]
I wonder I wonder what his margin was among the Cuban voters in date county

[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:41.940]
Huh

[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.440]
You think he got like 99% of the Cuban vote in the Alberta government

[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.060]
Who is under indictment on Medicare fraud money laundering witness tampering charges

[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.260]
But still popular in his little law of an neighborhood Miami. We like Albert

[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.600]
Don't afraid train

[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.980]
Come and Easter come and Easter come and Easter

[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.960]
Maracone Maracone come and Easter yeah same old crap. So like I said, you know

[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.640]
Jeb Bush wins and Florida it's an aberration because he was running against the dead man

[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.920]
Not because you really brought anything to the table and he took it a few blacks and Jews along the way

[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.780]
This time passing himself off is much more moderate than the first time he ran

[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:20.420]
But he's still the same piece of crap see George W. Bush in Texas. He doesn't bother me at all

[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:26.380]
He's a good governor anyone in the landslide and also got a big chunk of the Hispanic both there which is an aberration

[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.020]
Because he's doing a great job and he's not an extremist

[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:35.060]
He's not one of these right-wing goody two shoes for a phony baloney good Christian type of guys

[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.860]
Which yeah, Bush of course in Florida. We know is controlled by those people

[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.880]
So you know damn well in the year 2000s going to be out go against George W. Bush lots of Bush

[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.060]
Maybe it's the Bush people the Bush people we're gonna run for Bush

[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.340]
So that's your choice. Okay, so again, gonna be kind of a wooden guy who we all like Al Gore a little bit

[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.900]
He's kind of boring, but he's okay against George W. Bush who also by the way is fight of the five being good governor

[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.640]
Is very boring have you ever seen him speak?

[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.780]
Just look at him and all my stuff you start going off into a coma when you look at George W. Bush

[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:11.760]
In fact, he makes daddy look pretty exciting and he wasn't too left-rilling. Wow. That's the way it goes. Here's Miami Beach. Hello

[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.280]
Hey now. Yes, sir

[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.140]
I don't know if someone yesterday I went to go vote. Yeah

[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:21.540]
And there was you know there's people to stand in front of the polls

[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.540]
Giving out pamphlets

[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:30.960]
As you walk in yeah, well, I mean those you will air that with their bush

[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:37.020]
Oh, it's the bush the bush and they want to give me a pamphlet. I said no thank you

[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.040]
As I'm walking away the guy decides to call me an asshole really yeah

[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.300]
As I'm walking into to cast my vote. He's an asshole. Yeah

[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.760]
And I was gonna vote for voice and I ended up voting for my K there you go

[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.140]
So, you know

[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:56.620]
But why do I need to call you an asshole if you were gonna take the pamphlet I said I know thanks, you know whatever

[00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:01.200]
Because it didn't take me a propaganda that made you an asshole. Yeah, wow. That's good

[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.880]
Yeah, this guy was about like you know almost 60 years old

[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:11.640]
Uh-huh, and I just walked in on no thank you and then I heard a mumble asshole as I'm walking in I just turned around and like

[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.640]
Why why? I mean

[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.360]
Well, it was probably one of those good Christians by the way. Yeah, that's what it probably was okay

[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.740]
I want more things. Yes, sir. I mean

[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.720]
Jesse the body mentura. Yeah, uh, I just was watching a little thing the same thing

[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:32.500]
I'm easy doesn't want to be known as the body no way once we know as the mind Jesse the mind that's good. Just the brain Venturi

[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.960]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, he ain't no people's eyebrow. Okay. Thanks. Good. You know please

[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.660]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.260]
Okay, we got one call left in the board. I can see that there's a tremendous a tumultuous response here this morning

[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:50.200]
Both in bringing us answers to my questions about things that went on last night and people that are really all fired up

[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.640]
But you know something who cares because this is Florida

[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:58.560]
As I was sitting there last night because you already knew that bush was gonna when he was head by like 50,000 points a couple weeks ago

[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:04.080]
And he didn't really win a landslide he won by 12 points big margin, but out of not a gigantic one although you look around the state

[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:09.360]
I think it's County humorous to fact that we're on over here in Fort Myers. I think that's amusing. You want to know why?

[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.920]
Now Fort Myers is in Cod your County am I correct?

[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.740]
You might write about that or is it in Lee County

[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:23.960]
His Naples in Cod your County. I really have no idea. I guess Naples might be in Cod your County and Fort Myers might be in Lee County

[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:33.000]
But it's regardless in Lee County, McKay got 43,000 votes in Boots got 79,000 like almost double and in Cod your County

[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.900]
Which I guess is Naples

[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:42.900]
McKay got 17,000 and Boots got 42,000 like two and a half times. I mean no contest no real contentry

[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:50.900]
In fact, McKay only won five counties in the entire state. He won Gadson, Leon, Alachua, just barely Palm Beach and Broward

[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.320]
He won Broward really big

[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.200]
There you go. I'll close right next to him

[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.260]
He won Broward really big, but of course, nobody showed up in Broward. They had like 47% of the vote in Broward

[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.940]
Nobody showed up in Broward because most of the people are out there walkers near Colossalty Bagzards

[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.520]
Too much effort to go out there and who now wants to do that?

[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.040]
You're correct about your counties

[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:15.180]
What Naples is call your yeah, that's what I thought because you look on a mad little map here

[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.340]
A nice job by the way, which papers this in oh the Sunsend will finally did something good. That's good

[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:24.200]
Now this is the hero like I said much better coverage in a hero this morning with the Sunsend will how embarrassing

[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:30.040]
They give you like a little map and they show you County back County and the names of the county instead of just a little blob on it

[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:37.240]
Yeah, call your county is Naples some real real. I mean there is nobody to the left of a till of a hunt in Naples over there

[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:42.040]
Maybe one or two who are hiding as we speak under a rock under their beds

[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:48.980]
And Lee County is fort Myers and like it well Lee yummy 43,000 votes for from a kid that's not in the sneeze Anna

[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:53.340]
You can imagine that they actually had won a living person of the Democrats. He might have done pretty well

[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.300]
Or in Lee County and around the rest of the state

[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.380]
But like I said as I was watching all about because I knew that that was a foreground conclusion

[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.660]
And I'm watching Chuck Schumer beats that obnoxious that piece of crap

[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.980]
El de Mato in New York and I'm saying

[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.580]
Yeah

[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.300]
And then Edwards beats that lock. I mean what kind of is that like a warlock

[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.560]
L.O.C.D. What kind of an image that anywhere fear cloth in North Carolina

[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.540]
That Nazi another card carrying one of these with the 45 and I'm saying

[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.060]
oh

[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:29.360]
And Barbara boxer was supposed to be in big trouble against that gook out there in California wins landslide

[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:29.620]
oh

[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.640]
And all of my patty Murray in Washington was supposed to be in big trouble landslide

[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:35.920]
oh

[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.520]
And the interesting part about this is that it wasn't a big turnout

[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:46.020]
Democrats usually require a big turnout to you know have to although there was a big black turnout

[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.300]
Thank God for those blacks and spite of what this guy said before thank God for our brothers and sisters

[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.720]
You know if they can't speak at least they can vote

[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.320]
Here's a mobile and crawl springs. Hello. Yeah, good morning. The oh, yes, sir

[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:04.360]
Well, they last election of the century very interesting. Yeah, but I was different with you slightly the big

[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:12.640]
Or the plurality that mk1 and brawler and pomegranate was actually from the old class to me carrying gold juice

[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.520]
I know that but most of them didn't show up

[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.580]
Uh, you know, but it's interesting the Jewish journal supported uh

[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:20.900]
Bush but

[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:27.560]
The Democratic I guess it was forced to have it. Mm-hmm. What works? What would mean forced to have it?

[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.800]
Well, because they've always been the only liberals we got left in america or blacks and Jews

[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:37.980]
Well, what worries me is that they're getting older and older and older and they're not gonna be around much longer and I don't know

[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.540]
Who would you know the young people are gonna support at all? Yeah

[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.540]
Well, in other words that boards real well for getting out of the state of Florida in other few years

[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:52.900]
Well, it's gonna be George w versus uh, Gore and 90 in the year 2000 and uh, I don't know

[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.240]
It's gonna be like the 92 election all over again except I think gorge the real thing in quittany

[00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.960]
Okay, whatever you say it had a great life

[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.680]
We have an overlighted broward all three lines in date county come on let's hear from all those people

[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.180]
I voted for out government who never met a criminal that they didn't like come on let's hear it five six seven oh five sixty

[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.360]

I would give you all the information on our center one campaign which by the way thank you to davel amon

[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.300]
You know

[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.380]
I ripped an ass in the sense of an interesting letter which I will read by the way

[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.780]
But I'd give you the center one information about how much our totals are in this synatina

[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.360]
We still have six borders that we have nothing for last week yet

[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.000]
And I left a message on Carol's answering machine over there at center one and I can't get any

[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.540]
I get no numbers from them. I get no nothing here on the inside and we're running the campaign in a vacuum

[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.160]
It's a fundraiser in our vacuum post so we know we're over 50 grand

[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.920]
We know you can go to your borders and pick up the best of meal or check out neorodgers.com on the internet

[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.920]
The Q.A.M. Unlike

[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.280]
Beats and quiet and I don't need to listen to Barney Fag

[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.740]
Barney Frank

[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:54.520]
Crying in in my ear because I've made a few bucks off a book. I worked on following because of paid public service

[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.780]
And I can be successful and that's pretty damn depressing

[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.380]
But as usual with every problem there is a solution

[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.320]
Hi, I'm Jim and I'm here to tell you a little something about handguns

[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.700]
They scared the s*** out of people and intimidate them and giving you whatever you want

[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.740]
That's right handguns think about it. Need some cash?

[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.260]
Rub a bank don't have enough money for beard all the convenience

[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.300]
Makes chips and pretzels wire and it's all free if you've got a handguns

[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:26.940]
Some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend kill him to simple solution a life's complex problem

[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.160]
All I have to do is wait the five days for it and happiness is just around the corner

[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.880]
Now if you don't want to wait the five days who cares?

[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.520]
Buy the damn thing off the street just buy a lot of handguns

[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.620]
It's a great alternative to working problems out and get be considered a population control

[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.020]
Yes handgun they just might make a bank

[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:52.560]
Okay 10 45 and 5 60 WQM they just showed the numbers finally on CNN. It's only 10 40 complaints

[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.160]
Not going to be complaining this time are you a hair adorning

[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:02.620]
57 to 40 percent she what does that baby that red hair'd not see some bitch

[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.240]
Like to see that also Tommy Lee Jones for that was there was a polo accident. I remember hearing that

[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.040]
I mean anybody that plays polo don't they deserve like whatever they get

[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.400]
What your blue noses here's candle hello

[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.440]
Hey Neil yes sir good job of getting a vote out yesterday

[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.600]
Yeah, I did I got a lot of people out unfortunately not enough. We need another 300,000 especially here floor

[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.960]
Listen and reference to your comments from James Govart

[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.600]
But by the way I think of the book James Govart right excellent book. It is great

[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.020]
It's an interesting article in this month's vanity fair by Gore Vidal

[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.820]
Uh-huh. It's called award home and in fact he quotes

[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.640]
Number of times from the James Govart book. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Just a real quick to read you with the title of the

[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.920]
It's undercover. Oh, I can't miss that. Don't don't miss that one. Okay. Thanks

[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.500]
There you go. Gore Vidal. We all know about him. He's a genius, but of course he's one of those

[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:56.060]
We have an open line of days five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t wireless line

[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.200]
That's going to be the ticket by the way in the year 2000

[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.020]
Grovidal from president Barney Fag for vice president. What are you going to do then huh?

[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.500]
I think it just just to have a little fun. Okay

[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.740]
Just to get people a little nervous and see what it's like

[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.900]
After that election after they went overwhelmingly in a landslide

[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:17.680]
Then we're going to send all the three people to camp just for a couple of days not I mean not permanently just for a couple days

[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.420]
We'll have two on the euphoria arm, but

[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.900]
Just to get a taste of what it's like

[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.320]
Here's a mobile in Palm Beach garden. Hello

[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.240]
Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay, sir

[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:33.300]
Did you see an article with some sentinel last week about the government employees and had

[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.480]
sexual intercapacitation and they fired her? No

[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.840]
Yeah, I'm gonna send you the article, but she's a government employee. Yeah

[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:47.200]
Presence together and we have to follow the same rules. Yeah. Okay. Good luck to you pal. Good luck

[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.500]
Here's your guy must have been sleeping like riff and winkle

[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:55.060]
We have an open line in Broward five six seven oh five sixty pound five six the other eighteen two wireless line

[00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:02.260]
If everybody in Congress if everybody in the administration if everybody in the legislature was fired because they're having a

[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:08.440]
Banky-panky with somebody that works for our their staff then we would have anybody at office right now. Take it out. We'd have anarchy

[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.180]
Here's Miami. Hello

[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:18.920]
Miami. Yeah, hello. Yes, sir. Hey, look, I voted for Jeb. I know you like I think you should blow it out your ass

[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:26.000]
Yeah, and then that's that's the brilliant comment. There's a spec who voted for Jeb and I should blow it out my ass

[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.620]
And I let it go purposely because there you go with the mentality you're dealing with okay

[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.420]
I voted for Jeb, but I think you should blow it out your ass

[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.240]
Okay, now feel better. I do

[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:43.520]
See it. It's hopeless. I mean you're not gonna change these people the overwhelming majority of the Cubans and it is Cubans

[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:49.920]
It's not it's not Mexicans. It's not Nick or I wouldn't it's not Honduran. It's not Brazilians. It's not Puerto Rican. It's not

[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.080]
Colombians

[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.620]
It's a Cuban thing, baby

[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.440]
Now what does this mean up in smoking California?

[00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:05.880]
It says the propositions boy. I mean they just frost my ass. Why can't you put it on the goddamn screen you assholes at CNN

[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:11.380]
What does that mean up in Trump? Does that mean that the thing lost the a medical marijuana? I don't know what that means

[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.260]
Jesus Christ almighty, you know, this is one thing about America

[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:21.100]
They make it hard as hell for a lot of people to go out and vote and then just to try to get the results

[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:25.460]
You have to stand on your head and go through a big strong event unless you care what the governor of Minnesota is

[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:33.880]
By the way Jesse the geek of Ventura is the governor of Minnesota just in case you missed it the first 40,000 times this morning

[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:43.440]
Here's Miami. Hello. How you doing sir? Okay, sir. He probably voted for out government too. No doubt. Oh sure you bet

[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.140]
Any man? I'm pretty name is he probably wrote births name in there a couple of times for something for that patient

[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:53.100]
You know who's the next governor of New York? How do you win Hulk Holders? I would sounds good to me

[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:58.140]
Hey, he couldn't do no worse. What's wrong with having a Hulk for governor? We're a better than the guy that got in there now

[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:04.120]
Yeah, that's true. Any other thing about a lemon twirl what I don't like is that it's piecemeal is county by county right

[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.460]
So if they county adopted I understand that but you got to start somewhere

[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.280]
I mean you deal with a crazy N.O.A.

[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.600]
Start somewhere and a past drive wide margin too by the way

[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.220]
That's your when I was out in line going to vote

[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.620]
I asked some of the Cuban people out here about neo-Rodges

[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.880]
Yeah, yeah, they're like they're all closet listeners. Oh, they're calling you

[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:32.740]
They're calling me a coca-cabinista too. Oh, come at East America. And that's the best kind and then when I told us you is too

[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:38.400]
They were all hog wild about it. Oh, yeah. Oh my god. At least you feel like a Catholic we could accept them

[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.780]
Hey, don't end over your due atheist. Oh my god. I didn't tell me

[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.820]
I will start a riot

[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:47.020]
Have a great life now. I'll read it out. She

[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.600]
We have an open line in Dave County. We got any Cubans that voted for mcay yesterday

[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.340]
That didn't put like a little swastika on the ballot when it went out there and voted

[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.400]
Can we find one you think we'll find one? No

[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.180]
It's a buddy. She's married to one. Did that count? No

[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.140]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.200]
Tom 5 60

[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.800]
See because usually your wife has very good sense in your case

[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.380]
I would make an exception but nobody's perfect

[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.380]
Here is the sunrise hello

[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.420]
No, yes, sir you called Ed Koch

[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:20.160]
The other day you called Jeb Bush and he was public in and not see yeah

[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:29.180]
Okay, look on that where I'm wrong. Do you know I think that your typical liberal who attacks with slander and just venom

[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.760]
Anyone who had a different view right? Who live in America?

[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:40.300]
People do have you know what I have a right to express my opinion and I'll say by what I said Jeb Bush to me is a fascist and Ed Koch is an old

[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.800]
Fag so what about it?

[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.380]
Let me ask you this do you deny that Ed Koch is an old bag?

[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:51.720]
What does her sexuality have to do with anything because it seems to me that when somebody who's a homosexual starts him even though

[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.640]
I'll demotivate of course for professions to be a good friend of the gay community

[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.220]
And it wasn't really an issue in that campaign

[00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.300]
But when somebody is a turncoder who's a lifelong Democrat and supports the Republican party

[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.680]
I have a problem with that sir. What is it?

[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.280]
You're asking me like you like you don't know that he wants to marry New York?

[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:14.500]
He doesn't look out the model in that state is that our model came to a state when a situation was muted

[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.340]
No, it's better than when when when what when the size of when what's it?

[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.520]
What are you screaming about sir when what situation was needed?

[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.960]
He dealt with the model first hand

[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.420]
You never dealt with that

[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.840]
He dealt with the first match

[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.980]
Who needs to state what's going on?

[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.140]
He just said before it's American I have an opinion I don't like out of the model

[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.820]
He's a god then piece of crap, okay?

[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.020]
He's a turdburger

[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.820]
And they're dancing in the halls all over the White House today

[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.780]
The model went down in flames and it wasn't even close by the way

[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.720]
Chuck Schumer he's not probably not liking because Chuck Schumer is Jewish

[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.960]
That's what he's upset about

[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.480]
You anti-Semite?

[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:51.200]
We have an open line of day one and brown or five six seven oh five sixty and pound five

[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.880]
Six the on the AT&T wireless line

[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.260]
Yeah hate to break the news to you

[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.200]
But the days are all over all you go and head your chance

[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.980]
All you far visitor right wingers

[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.780]
The moderate go and you're okay, okay?

[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.520]
They're too busy playing polo whatever they're doing

[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.640]
But all you fanatics out there way they Christian right whatever they want to play

[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.900]
You're all your days are over

[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.500]
The Jews of blacks the fags the women we're taking over maybe it's our turn now

[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.400]
That's it

[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.180]
Suffered at Dan kill mostly brown or in Chicago because she's got real problems

[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:24.180]
Maybe she can run off with clearest time at clearest time is now and make up for last time

[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.160]
Where we going let's go to uh

[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.380]
Volka hello

[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.060]
Hello yes sir

[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:32.620]
Yeah, I'm a Democrat. I don't always agree with you Neil

[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:37.580]
But yeah compared to Ross limbo you're a breath of pressure. Yeah, Ross limbo

[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.520]
Yeah, whatever that's a lot of dance. Yeah

[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:47.380]
Uh my question is why didn't the Democrats push the fact that push a ring push push

[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.740]
Put when when jab was uh, is dead was in power. He pushed the 14 million

[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:59.040]
Yeah small business loan through the uh, sir the elections over hate to break the

[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.020]
There's nothing more boring than here in you know all the they pushed it

[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:07.860]
They talked about it about it never stole a freight train but all these phony deals and guess what it's still been making different

[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.680]
Don't blame jab bush for this blame the Democrats for putting a dead man up for governor

[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.320]
That's where the problem lays even even in a right wing state like this that's becoming more Republican by the moment

[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.860]
And the guy that called earlier was right

[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:22.240]
The old Jews are dying off their dino

[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:27.640]
In droves and of course they're not replacing them because there are no more old Jews anywhere at least not that old

[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.800]
And uh, that's the problem because the old the days of the very very very extremely liberal

[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.080]
Abroad and even parts of date. I mean look at all the people and you know something

[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.740]
Bursted and win date county by that much either. Let me take a puke and see what that number is

[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:47.520]
Dead county this is well. Listen to there's still a lot of votes were but only he was only ahead by 10,000

[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.940]
In fact, if you take the Cuban vote out of date county mcay won a date county

[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:53.500]
Handily

[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.520]
Why are you talking to who is that? Oh, it's just some crank

[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:05.260]
Some stick no actually some New Yorker. Oh some New Yorker. What a shock that is now. What is his problem

[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.600]
Let's put him on the ear immediately if not sooner that won't be him. It'll be him Q.A.M

[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:20.660]
Hello. Yes, sir. I am calling new speaking. I'm new. Hi. I'm a who you human see uh 59 year old right and uh

[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:33.360]
Mr. Bush had his agenda one thing which is

[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:39.700]
giving vouchers to children right for school. I have a daughter in a public school. I can say for it

[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:45.740]
I voted against that because I think it's just law. The effect that that would have on the public school system right?

[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.260]
Is to have a legal link finished.

[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.460]
Finish off

[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.800]
Well, god bless you sir

Okay, we have two open lines to date. I know we'd find one sooner or later

[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:15.980]
You guys call yesterday who oh and you know something I must be really slow

[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:19.740]
Yesterday I was too politically oriented because when a guy called about sitting down when he pees

[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:25.560]
And he said about to get something tomorrow and the morning with a big rod that uh, I mean what what since does that make he's got to sit down

[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.980]
If you can't push it down when you're standing up how do I feel you push it down when you're sitting down?

[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.580]
I mean way way forward huh

[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.000]
No, not lean way forward you'd have to like mount the ball

[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.540]
Is what you'd have to do maybe that's what he's doing. Maybe he's mounting the ball

[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:44.280]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha anybody ever mount the ball

[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.140]

I'm the president, not the friggin' post

[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.360]
The time is now and I'm coming cleave

[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.480]
I like my boobies with cherry cancree

[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.800]

[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.340]
Your big, dead, big, black, black, red

[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.960]
We're the first to see your dress

[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.000]
Cleared it, beyond, it was coming in

[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.620]
I got a little sicker, I'm ready to unzip

[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.900]
So I can't start doing linda trips

[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.240]
Checking out the booties, I'm ready to pop

[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.780]
Or, and everybody, I'm letting my pants

[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:32.820]
Eager off!

[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.500]
Squared, squirt

[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.440]
Lebanon on three at five-sixty, WQ, I got the man, dogs, you manage

[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:36.900]
Yeah!

[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:39.000]
For Hank this afternoon from two to six, Hank's down

[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000]
Away to the breeders cup

[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.600]
And then we got the booster, briefly six to seven

[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.080]
We got the panties and the black Hawks

[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.120]
Don't I, anybody ready for that?

[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:45.560]
Uh-huh

[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.320]
I area girl, he's pretty excited about it

[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.700]
So they're having a recount of the Garcia-Gutton race

[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.360]
Because it was less than 300 votes different

[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.920]
And of course we know that there might be a little hanky panty

[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.600]
You know, you don't think there could be that, do you?

[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:55.760]
No

[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.640]
Christian Coalition's stalwart

[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.400]
US Representative Vince Snowbarger

[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.060]
Lost the Democrat Dennis Moore in Kansas

[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:06.500]
While Democrat Tammy Baldwin became the first open lesbian elected to Congress

[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.900]
in Madison, Wisconsin

[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.620]
In Washington State, sneaker mom versus Christian mom

[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.860]
And come at Democrat Patty Murray, V.U.S. Representative Linda Smith

[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:22.080]
A Christian right conservative backed by a cadre of diehard known as Linda's Army

[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.580]
And Patty Murray beat the snout out of her wasn't even close

[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.160]
And as far as the medical marijuana thing, this is stuff that's been sent to the

[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:28.660]
Internet

[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.400]
Medical marijuana voters in Washington State, Oregon, Alaska, and Nevada

[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.700]
Appeared to be approving measures to legalize medical marijuana

[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:38.320]
Arizona appeared to be turning it down and we have nowhere on California or the

[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.120]
Adiffered Columbia

[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:43.260]
Open line in the Broward, all three in date of course, five six seven, oh five

[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.320]
six, eight, five, six, the animal, the one line

[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.760]
It's hard to make a phone connection in date when you're under the bed hiding with

[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.860]
your cell phone, I understand

[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.360]
Here's for Lauderdale, hello

[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:53.520]
Yeah, I need to

[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:53.980]
Yes sir

[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:59.040]
Yeah, you mentioned that you'd like all this when the facts take over

[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.740]
or like all the three people to put them in concentration camps and all that

[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.740]
So they've never found what a place to be gay

[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.180]
It's the other way to find what it's like to be gay

[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:07.860]
Yeah

[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.240]
And you took that seriously so you wanted a conversation about that comment?

[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.380]
No, I just like to make a report

[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:15.920]
And what you're talking about?

[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:21.680]
If you'd like to have every penny that you ever worked for your entire life taking away from you from the

[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.800]
government, like many of the Cubans that got happened a lot of the Cubans that came here from Cuba

[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:29.720]
What do you think of that?

[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.440]
What does that mean?

[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.920]
What would you be willing to go through that?

[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.440]
Well what does that got to do?

[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.980]
Well, that got, we're not in Cuba sir, we're in the United States

[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:40.480]
The United States is where the Cubans were given the opportunity to come and rebuild their lives

[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.040]
I don't see too many Cubans complaining about being here

[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:44.840]
Well, I'm just saying

[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.340]
You're talking to me

[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.240]
Yeah, well get somebody else, okay?

[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.000]
Not interested in hearing your baloney

[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.640]
I mean, well what the hell is the comparison with that?

[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.520]
Okay, we got one call left on the board

[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:01.920]
We got two open lines in Broward, 500 and date, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and 0.5, 60 on a mobile one line

[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.840]
I make obviously a tongue-in-cheek comment

[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.300]
And this guy wants to have a dialogue about it

[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.220]
He wants to give me a retort

[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.800]
Comparative suffering, who's suffering the most?

[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.660]
Okay, let's talk about today, who has been persecuted the most?

[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:17.040]
Cuban, Blacks, Jews, Fags, come on, somebody else

[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:21.180]
Indian, comparative suffering, I love those discussions, man

[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:25.360]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0.5, 60 on a mobile one line

[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.140]
Here's Hollywood, hello

[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:29.680]
Hello

[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:30.760]
Hello, Neil

[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.600]
Speak to me, sir

[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.560]
Yeah, how you doing?

[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:33.100]
Okay

[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.540]
I'm taking a vote because of that evil marijuana

[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:36.800]
They don't let us vote anymore

[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.520]
You know, so we're persecuted to the five smokers

[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.420]
What does that mean?

[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:42.520]
What does that mean?

[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.720]
Oh, yes, following you with you

[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.000]
I have a little bit of weed and you know, let you vote

[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:46.880]
Oh, you had a phone?

[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.480]
Oh, I'm afraid about that, right?

[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:49.960]
I'll hardly come on

[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.820]
You're for not sitting down though when you got that morning rocket

[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:53.300]
Yeah

[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.000]
Just turn on the sink full blast, walk right up

[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.360]
And on the floor

[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.680]
Okay, okay pal

[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:00.960]
Okay, aim straight

[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.920]
There's a straight hue to four, just like feeder North

[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.340]
When in doubt, put your dink in the sink is what he said

[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.800]
And the reason that we've got nobody call is

[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.860]
They see a searching for satellite signals raining like the end of the world out there

[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.100]
So we got a captive audience

[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.900]
They're just afraid they're going to get electrocuted when they pick up the phone and call

[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:16.600]
Which they will

[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.020]
But I think you know and my birthday's coming up tomorrow anybody

[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:24.020]
Thank you very much Gary the Simon who brings me a nice card to check for center one

[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.920]
And we heard from center one yet today by the way

[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.240]
Is our good friend Carol giving us any reports and any updates on the month with no

[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.740]
Well, I'm telling you Carol you're making it in very very hard. I'm doing the best I can

[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.900]
We got over 50 grand in for center one. We got two months to go

[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:40.640]
But it's very very hard. I'm having an easier time getting the results from the election results from Hawaii

[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.240]
That I am getting another returns from center one

[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.920]
But thanks Gary the Simon who sends me a beautiful life millenium calendar

[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.700]
I'll look back at the past thousand years for 99 and every day on their it's all here

[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.900]
And the reason for that is we have no address

[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.780]
Nobody nobody knows our job even I don't know the address

[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.500]
I know I don't want to know the friend. Huh?

[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.840]
I give it up to people all day long

[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:07.200]
But I'm just telling you that the ordinary schmuck out there that's not going to make the effort of calling you for an address

[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.920]
Which would be me and like most other people

[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.860]
They we have no word like unreachable. We're unavailable

[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:18.360]
No, I think we need to get a PO box or something because I bet you we've been getting some checks and mail for center one

[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:25.640]
And certainly tons of birthday cards, but we just don't get any mail here at the QA because we're like lost in space

[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:34.220]
There's been a major setback today for the NBA lockout player representative Chiu

[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.900]
If you can pull it off, please pair

[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.280]
Please come up with your name ball and probably

[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:54.680]
If you don't have to pull it off, I'm not going to pull it off

[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.980]
I'm not going to pull it off, I'm not going to pull it off

[00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.660]
If you don't have to pull it off, you're going to be the state guard

[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:11.840]
And you're going to be the number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one

[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.840]
You've won, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one

[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.840]
And you're all flammable, both

[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.600]
Thank you

[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:28.760]
Okay, let me 13 at 560 WQM, we have two open lines in date 567 05 60, 05 560, and a mobile one line

[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.080]
Anybody know how that speaking of Indian gambling?

[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.820]
Major major issue on a ballot out there in California about the Indians

[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:39.560]
And they spent between the casino people in Vegas and the Indians on a reservation out there

[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.740]
They spent millions and millions of dollars on the both sides of that issue

[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:47.660]
And of course if the Indians got gambling approved, the Vegas people are going to be psychotic and losing a lot of revenue

[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.220]
Anybody know how that turned out?

[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:49.520]
No

[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.460]
I mean it's only 11.15 in the morning, 8.15 on the west coast

[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.780]
You know, we're a little bit slow here, anybody got the answers to these questions?

[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:56.260]
No!

[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:00.080]
See if we had a real computer in here, we just say to George during the break

[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.620]
I mean I realized I'm getting way out of line now

[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:07.380]
If we had a real computer in this studio, which we have no room for anyway

[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:10.940]
And had some contact with the outside world that could hook onto the internet right now

[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:14.460]
And just look these things up instead of sitting here like, well, blah blah blah like that

[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:16.040]
Like that, the shoe for always just doing

[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.420]
Does anybody got to see that's the way we function here?

[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.520]
Does anybody out there know?

[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.020]
Is there anybody who used to work in our news department at the old station?

[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.300]
Got any information on it?

[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.000]
That's the only way we know because this station has got no contact

[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.800]
All we know is that Jesse the body venture of one governor of Minnesota

[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:34.740]
That was a comment and passing on a station this morning about there being an election yesterday

[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:39.440]
Because there's more important stuff like let's rehash the dolphin game again from my son day, which is only Wednesday

[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.120]
Here's North and Palm Beach, hello

[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:47.900]
Hey Uncle Neil, here's a goriam in North Palm under the age of 100 who voted for Buddy McKay

[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.620]
Yeah, McKay did good in Palm Beach, won it

[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:54.180]
Yeah, that's what I wasn't sure about because you were absolutely correct on the media coverage last night at seven o'clock

[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:59.040]
I was sitting down on my big fat ass on the couch ready to watch it rooting for the Democrats

[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:05.480]
And all of a sudden we get a little piece from Tom Broke all of a sudden they go to that stupid magazine show

[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.040]
Right magazine show is squeal of fortune, jeopardy

[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.700]
I mean God forbid the local channels should sacrifice half an hour to give us the God damn news information

[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.060]
God forbid that should happen

[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.100]
Well I was really proud of Palm Beach County

[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:21.960]
Well this is still with only part of it in but yeah, McKay wanted to handle it about 40,000 votes

[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.000]
Okay, good

[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:32.300]
Well I was ready last night I had to wait till 10 o'clock to find out that the two those two right wing extremists from North Carolina and New York had lost and I was very happy about that

[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.520]
Lot of fair cloth and Al the motto

[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.860]
I don't even try and flames, I love it

[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:36.480]
I was great

[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.100]
And that guy that called before I hope he elopes with Ed Prakash, I hope they have a great life together

[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:40.660]
Him and Crock

[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.100]
Take care Neil, love you

[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:42.880]
Have a great day pal

[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.720]
Yeah, a lousy coverage baby

[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.240]
And yeah, and the media who are always just screaming the oh it's your it's your civic duty

[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:57.460]
You've got to get out and vote and the meantime all they want to do is put the same bull crap on there the same crashing airplanes the same naked gymnast

[00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:03.460]
The same whatever the hell kind of bull crap they're putting on there the same shootouts at the okay corral the same bleeding bodies

[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.800]
They're on Channel 7 news

[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.500]
For every time we're sent you believe the parking lot you got a chance of that happening but anyway

[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.040]
Here's a mobile in the Gables hello

[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.540]
How you doing Neil?

[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:15.160]
Okay, sir

[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:21.100]
Well first of all the only cubans that don't like you are the old ones and those those don't have too much left in a menu

[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.260]
Well true, I assume

[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.860]
True of them coming east they're all bunch of commonestans to be asked me

[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.940]
Yeah, next I'm a whole year I voted for Buddy McKay

[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:28.220]
Really?

[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.460]
I voted Democrat Democrat across the board

[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.740]
I'm registered Republican

[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:34.040]
Yeah

[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.360]
That's sick of the crap

[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.060]
Yeah

[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.900]
And you know, basically yeah

[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:45.700]
What scares me though is the old cubans are trying to dam this to influence the newer generation

[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:49.060]
I have a friend of mine who voted Republican

[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:54.620]
I asked them what you're reasoning behind voting for guys like Bush who have no experience whatsoever

[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:55.120]
Right

[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.540]
They want to slow for the heat

[00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.200]
He couldn't answer me

[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.780]
He didn't know he had

[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:04.460]
He had brainwashed just like his Catholic religion is the same thing they bring you up automatically if you're Cuban in his town

[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:08.580]
You've got to be Catholic you've got to be a Republican and you've got to be as far to the right as you possibly can

[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:10.460]
And conceal your homosexuality

[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:11.120]
That doesn't matter

[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:12.720]
Yeah

[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.100]
Okay, have a great day pal

[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.120]
Oh, on the old cubans

[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:15.460]
Congratulations

[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.220]
What are you laughing about?

[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.840]
Those are the three main things

[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.900]
Hide your boy friends

[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.560]
Be a good obedient Catholic

[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:29.140]
Of course it's hard to be a good obedient Catholic unless you don't consider relationship with father or tool being homosexual

[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:31.860]
Well, he's just a minister to your needs I guess

[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.760]
You're all in crockle right

[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.900]
He's just ministering your needs

[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:40.740]
Because we all know when it comes to those Cuban churches in schools like Columbus

[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.260]
There's no fact in the church

[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.460]
Make no mistake about that

[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:44.960]
And we all know they're just visitors

[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.480]
They're tourists over there in Westland

[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.480]
There's no Cuban dizzling around at JC pennies over there in Westland

[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.140]
That's for the answer

[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.320]
Those are two desters

[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.840]
That's right they're probably French Canadians

[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.420]
Because Cubans don't do that

[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:57.300]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale

[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:57.640]
Hello

[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.820]
Hi, Neil

[00:44:58.820 --> 00:44:59.440]
Yes sir

[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.100]
Listen, new listener first time ever getting through to you

[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.160]
I enjoyed the show by half to tell you I couldn't vote for me

[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.240]
Because he's a walking stiff

[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:08.640]
Yeah, I'm meeting one

[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.960]
Well, I'm meeting that I don't know the guy

[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:15.200]
He seems like he's on the project like the governor was

[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.860]
I mean the guy just doesn't seem to have it together for me

[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.300]
Well, the governor was also a walking stiff

[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.300]
So what they're into that make?

[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:24.300]
Okay, at least he was a buffer against the far right

[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:27.020]
At least he wasn't against women's rights to choose for themselves

[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.300]
At least he wasn't for public school vouchers

[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.420]
So that we can put the public school system out of business

[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.120]
I do have to agree with you Neil

[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.160]
Listen, I'm going to say

[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.000]
Well wait a minute, so you see you have to agree with me then

[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.680]
How could you say you voted for Jeb Bush?

[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.480]
I didn't vote for Bush

[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.320]
I didn't vote for McCay

[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.320]
I didn't vote for E.J.

[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.500]
I sure it's not the vote actually

[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:43.880]
Yeah

[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.520]
I voted on every other subject of my voting

[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:49.180]
I voted because I wasn't agreeing with either of them

[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:49.880]
Well, that's brilliant

[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.500]
I'm certain now I want to tell you I do sit down to be

[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.020]
Because I got to get rid of the house

[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.100]
I don't want to catch me

[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.100]
Yeah, okay

[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.600]
Okay, don't ever call the show again, pal

[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.820]
We have an open line in Broward all of a day

[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.320]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.920]
0 5 5 60 on a mobile one line

[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.940]
I believe that guy really has to sit down to pee

[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:06.840]
And after the reason he said

[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.220]
He's got to sit down to pee

[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.280]
Make no mistakes, Quartz Quartz

[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.400]
Here's Delray Beach, hello

[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.060]
Okay, nice talking to you

[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.260]
Here's a mobile in Miramar, hello

[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:17.940]
Hey Neil

[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:18.700]
Yes sir

[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:22.100]
I heard you talking about the Indians in California

[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:23.240]
California

[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.260]
Yeah, they do

[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.960]
Yeah, they went through

[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.740]
They did

[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:28.480]
Yeah, they got their casinos

[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.160]
What, people in Vegas are going to be psychotic

[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.980]
I know, and I heard that's supposed to be not far from Santa Anita

[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.440]
That's why I was interested in it because I'm in the horse industry

[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:38.840]
Right

[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:41.580]
Santa Anita is being sold soon

[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.420]
But that had nothing to do with it

[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:47.400]
But that casino was supposed to be not far from Santa Anita

[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.200]
Yeah, I wonder, because the only people I heard who

[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.580]
Spend a lot of money with the people from Vegas and the Indians

[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.580]
But you would think they're just like here in Florida

[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.440]
Remember when we headed on the ballot every pound of beer

[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.460]
That's right, per me

[00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.020]
When Ballistic and spent a lot of time in money

[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.780]
Propagodizing against the evils of casino gambling

[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.000]
That's right

[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.320]
That's going to take a bite out of Santa Anita

[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:11.800]
And you know, Hollywood Park's biggest holding is casinos now

[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.120]
They're buying a ball of room, but some of them are sticky now

[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.420]
Right, well, they're getting smart

[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.260]
Yeah, all right

[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:18.320]
Thanks for the easy way

[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:19.960]
See, that's the way we find out from the audience

[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.080]
Because we have no contact with the outside world in here

[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:22.680]
We're in a vacuum

[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.040]
We have an open line in Broward

[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.060]
We do know it's raining like hell because my satellite

[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.820]
This is searching for satellite signal on the little dish

[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.960]
And what happens, you know, it's raining cats and dogs

[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:35.020]
Because just like Little Brian North Cross said

[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:38.380]
You know, it was the greatest moment in recent times

[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.200]
I'm watching Channel 6 News last night

[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.800]
And I forget who the weather guy was

[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.720]
But I want us to look to weather guy whoever was on Channel 6

[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.420]
One of their non-descript people whose name I don't know

[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.600]
But he said, yeah, Mitch, the remnants of it are coming

[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.900]
We're going to have a lot of rain

[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:55.380]
But you don't have to panic, don't go running to the stores

[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:58.240]
No plywood, no bottled water, no batteries

[00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.660]
It's just going to be a lot of rain

[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:04.180]
And I loved it because you just knew he was taking a good shot at the weather theory

[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.300]
I loved the way he said it

[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.280]
Nice going to our Channel 6

[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.760]
But time he did something right

[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:11.280]
On by the way, Jennifer Velopi

[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.020]
I threw that thing out from CityLinke, which I should have saved

[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.400]
About how when they moved to their new studios in Miramar

[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.420]
Jennifer wants to be picked up by Limazine and the brought to and from work every day

[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.080]
And how she thinks her don't stink

[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:25.920]
And how Tony Segredo wants back in

[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.920]
And he wants his hand back in the sports department

[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.320]
How they all hate him like poison over there

[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.600]
And how he's trying to tell him how to run the sports department

[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.840]
Even though they made him into a news anchor, which nobody believed

[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.540]
Got some real problems over there at Channel 6

[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.480]
Here's Tamarack, hello

[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.200]
And you?

[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.500]
Maybe Barry Dillard can tell him what TV's really all about

[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.020]
Yes sir

[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:48.380]
And you know, I'm just going to see if you're as upset as I am that that the butt flyer is thoroughly crisp lost

[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:51.940]
Same asshole I called yesterday

[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:53.180]
Yeah, and?

[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.680]
I just called to see if you're upset

[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.520]
I mean, I really did vote for the guy I think I didn't know

[00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:58.400]
Let me ask you this

[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.280]
Do you think your call was amusing yesterday?

[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.220]
No, I mean, I really want to know

[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.000]
I mean, you don't vote so you know, too

[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.860]
Let me say it again just like I said yesterday

[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:07.860]
You really think that the call was amusing

[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.980]
That you start out with a story about your wife voted one way and you voted the other

[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:15.540]
And negative about it and then you give me a song event about the guy had had no chance in the first place

[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:17.160]
And I always pro gay and pro this

[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.600]
Well, what does that have to do with anything?

[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.300]
And now you're calling me again, is this like your obsession in life?

[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.860]
Or are you just all bent out of shape because of your right wing Christian fanatics lost last night?

[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:25.560]
Is that what it is?

[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:26.400]
That's pretty bad

[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.380]
Yeah, that's pretty much it

[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:28.340]
Too bad

[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:29.560]
You lose

[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:36.940]
I mean, you know, there's only one thing this this guy could be on for two seconds is Jackass

[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.340]
Who calls two days in a row

[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:42.240]
There's only one thing you need to call ask him where you fudge back and we know the answer

[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:48.540]
We have an open line in Broward to a date five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the mobile one line

[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:54.320]
See this is this is what you deal with when you deal with the little myopic combines

[00:49:55.260 --> 00:50:00.260]
You can't have a disagree with religion politics a sports or you like that teen you're an asshole

[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:02.120]
Yeah, because then it makes you a bad guy

[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:08.440]
Now I will say this that I would agree that if you happen to be one of those very far right leaning nazis

[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:12.480]
That it wouldn't my opinion make you a bad guy or bitch or whatever you might be and I don't want nothing to do with you

[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.260]
Just stay the hell away

[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:18.820]
But this guy got like an obsession he's got a recommend obsession is what he's got

[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:25.660]
Here's a curl spring, so I know yes sir men should be standing up

[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.740]
Yeah, that's what killed Elvis

[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:35.800]
He wasn't being sir. He was doing drugs sitting down. So I guess the messages do your drug standing up? Is that it?

[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.640]
We have an open line in Broward. He's just reading okay

[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.760]
He was getting some reading matter which or anybody does and you could read blood in America and get some good reading material

[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.680]
Because you know a mind is a terrible thing to waste

[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.660]
I'm probably one of the few people in the world that's got the balls on a plane

[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:56.000]
When I'm sitting there my first pass cabbid on a plane and I got to finally

[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.740]
Absolutely correct sure get out of here do that

[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:04.060]
Which I hate doing on the plane by the way there's a little very old guy

[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:07.040]
But when nature finally is calling and will not take no for an answer

[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:13.960]
I'm the only person in the world probably that takes either whatever I got a newspaper or a book up into the toilet on the plane

[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:17.100]
If I think I'm going to be in there more than two or three minutes

[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:20.760]
What? I never I never see anybody else do that

[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.180]
It's just not proper etiquette and you know what I don't give a crap

[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:30.480]
Because if I'm going to be sitting down there I mean in which your brain a little bit read something even if it's the

[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:36.380]
The national inquirer even if it's the tabler even if the guy damn son you probably get better information than we get here

[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:40.260]
Oh by the way yes gambling one in California the Indian

[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:44.260]
The guy just called and told me that if you would stop not going to call him for these at once

[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:50.400]
That's just it they were just calling the guy was just on the air telling me that like two calls ago three calls ago

[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:53.520]
Before the guy that's got his back bone problem before that guy

[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:59.120]
They counties open even though it may be raining like that now the thing is it's going to try to come back on or not this satellite

[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:04.580]
Well must be the end of the world out there like I said I think the kind of channel six let us down

[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:11.140]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line as we wait for a tremendous response from Dave

[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:13.920]
But don't panic

[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:17.020]
Here's a mobile in Cooper City hello

[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:21.900]

[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:32.980]
Bloppy

[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:36.380]
Oh Tony is a cigarette or Jennifer Bloppy I don't know

[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:40.020]
I'm just sitting here in the rain Neil

[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:46.160]
I voted straight Democrat my who we at wife voted straight Democrats as I told her to

[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:51.440]
And on on the way out of the polling place where you put your ballot in the box

[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.500]
My wife left the bride and I was still voting and when I got outside she said you know the old the old fart

[00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:03.600]
Who gives out the stickers as I voted yeah you slapped it on her breast and cough a little feel what's up with that

[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.160]

[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:23.520]
What's up, Tom?

[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:30.900]
1132 or 560 WQM our good friend Eric in Orlando who does such a great job on our neo-roger.com website is unfortunately in this case wrong

[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:38.700]
Sorry Eric you are you said travel gaming past in California which it did but he also says there were no propositions regarding medical marijuana

[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:44.580]
That's long it was on the ballot we just can't get an answer on it for whatever the reason

[00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:53.900]
Now what about this trip to Columbia here's one the took long making their own hands and trying to be for from legalized gambling to they doesn't say

[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:04.140]
You're probably out playing tennis playing golf you're out there wandering around the middle of the street even over like drowning over here I understand

[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.460]
Probably a lot of people still wandering around looking for their polling place

[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:13.940]

Oh Jesus say a crap man you you are so lucky we've gotten out of here

[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:02.560]
I don't know

[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.340]
So I'll ask you the question

[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.820]
You're about to get what?

[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:14.940]
I'm about to get nailed again by somebody I think it's a host that we fired here late night host to KFI

[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:21.600]
Who is now you know objecting to the youth my use of the word die come here

[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:22.540]
Suck my dick

[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:23.760]
No he said die

[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.460]
Yeah Suck my dick

[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:25.800]
Yeah

[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.360]
So I never have to went to Brian Kosseloss who we ever get that thing in the last time?

[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.360]
I have no idea I haven't heard of anything I haven't heard anything

[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.900]
It just all goes on

[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:39.020]
And the meter is running the meter is running into Cox people are paying and it's great

[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:44.920]
It's something that Storm calls me every now and again to give me an update or to do

[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:49.980]
Oh a normal call to you that's good doesn't make me turn my calls I'm glad you're doing well what he feels like it

[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:51.780]
Ever since that whole thing about the feet in the arena?

[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:53.340]
In between hits he you know

[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:59.500]
So anyway I got to miss you and I called George to get the email address if you guys have one

[00:56:59.500 --> 00:56:59.860]
No

[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:02.800]
So he'll give it to you

[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:03.240]
Alright

[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.560]
So let me ask you did the medical marijuana thing passed out there?

[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:08.620]
I don't yeah it did

[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.620]
Did it? Yeah it passed two years ago

[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:12.100]
No no I mean yesterday

[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.580]
Well the medical marijuana initiative passed in 96

[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.860]
You know what I'm calling you? Yeah no with them

[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:19.800]
It passed in 96

[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:20.120]
No

[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:22.100]
And they haven't been able to implement it

[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:22.540]
Right

[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:23.780]
With the real thing

[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:26.800]
But that was on a ballot again yesterday and that's the one thing I can't get any answers to

[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:28.640]
By the way Bob Dornigot being handling

[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.880]
You really have a crook broken up about that

[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:34.340]
Oh man

[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:35.900]
The red of Sanchez won down there

[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:39.220]
It's kind of hard to challenge the outcome of the edelach and we lost by 45 million votes

[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:43.260]
You know that's the one thing that's the front page of the LA Times

[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:45.620]
Is the medical marijuana initiative?

[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:48.880]
I mean maybe I'm dreaming because now people are telling me it wasn't on a ballot

[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:52.020]
I know it passed in Nevada and it passed in Washington state

[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:55.020]
After Washington state it was on a ballot in I think it lost in Arizona

[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:59.020]
It was on a ballot in DC and supposedly California maybe they give us some more information

[00:57:59.020 --> 00:57:59.860]
Maybe it wasn't on there

[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:01.660]
No California passed in 96

[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:05.440]
Because I know Oakland the city council there because they shut the place down

[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:08.560]
And Oakland was your what do I tell you this for?

[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.920]
You're out there you know what the story is

[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:14.220]
Well what happened was I think in Oakland they shut it down because there's a court challenge to it

[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:16.020]
That's what happened I mean you know things get bad

[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:18.420]
The city council made an exception

[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:22.260]
They said that they have to give these people a place by one vote I think it was a five four vote

[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:22.600]
Right

[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:25.700]
So they have to give these people a place to get their medical marijuana and they okayed it

[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:30.340]
Yeah well it but like I said like everything else it's been thrown into a courtroom

[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.160]
Because you know some people just don't like it

[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.860]
If you do anybody smoke and dope so

[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:34.860]
Well too bad for them

[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:35.860]
It's not in there

[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:37.020]
So how are you doing out there?

[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.400]
How's things at KF5 Bill?

[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.120]
Things were great till our last book

[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:41.840]
We had a bad book

[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.920]
Oh it's a horrible but horrible summer book

[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.300]
But things were okay up until then

[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:46.740]
Yeah

[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:51.040]
Still on at night that's never going to change

[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:53.960]
And what happened with the deal with the stupid talk that we're done here

[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:56.380]
That we kept hearing those rumors you were going to be simulcasting down here

[00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:57.180]
Which everybody?

[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:01.180]
Yeah I mean what we have you know we're still looking to syndicate the show

[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:05.840]
But I don't want to do it with you know just any network I'm sure you understand that

[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:12.900]
And Koch broadcasting was actually going to put a proposal about syndicating the show

[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:13.220]
Yeah

[00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:16.180]
And it frankly was no good it was a lousy proposal

[00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:17.160]
Yeah that's good

[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:20.380]
You know we decided not to go with that

[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:22.980]
What about your show because I had talked to Norma

[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:23.700]
Oh yeah

[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:26.000]
Oh Norma is really knocking doors down there

[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.060]
He's knocking doors down to find medical marijuana is what he's looking for in non medical

[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:31.580]
But forget about him

[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:36.580]
No I'm stuck I'm stuck with a you know with a Pudgey old Jew for a lawyer

[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:40.580]
Who's like you know all rolled up into a ball over there waiting for the Dodgers to sign

[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:41.920]
And welcome counter play for his base

[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:44.700]
And other than that nothing's going to happen here

[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:46.360]
Well you know well

[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.880]
Although we are in here and Fort Myers

[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:51.460]
It took us off for while the protest was so big and then the numbers came out

[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:52.660]
We actually had a number over there

[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:55.880]
And at Beasley station where we're in there and Fort Myers and all those those took us yeah

[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:59.380]
So what is that is that something that the company is doing or you guys are doing that in the party

[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:01.080]

Well the guy that he replaced with any Ronald Owen's who isn't San Francisco and everybody said the thing

[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.340]
Yeah Ronald Owen's used to be on KGO

[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.480]

[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:00.940]

He's still on KGO but they were sound cast in this show

[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.100]

[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.620]
They sound like the same guy

[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:11.520]
Ellis Randall sounds like Ronald Owen

[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.200]
Ron Ronald and they're the same voice

[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.360]

[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:14.860]
Everything

[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:17.860]
So one of them's conservative I guess Randall is a

[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:19.440]
A self-painting fact yeah

[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.140]
Something like that

[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:20.400]
Yeah

[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.380]

[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.660]
I'm very happy at three

[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:14.520]
We live out in Ventura County which is about 40 miles away from LA

[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.820]
Ventura County, then that's a great boxer, the governor of Minnesota
