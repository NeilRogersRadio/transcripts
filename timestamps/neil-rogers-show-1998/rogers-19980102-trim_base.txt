[00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.300]
Great listen, um, I saw that game too, and it was a farce. There was at least there was at least one second left

[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.280]
Right after he spiked the ball there was definitely time had not expired. I know it was for the crowd

[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.520]
The referee had expired

[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.200]
Money on the game, right, but what is it?

[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.920]
Have anyone called to say bag it at all to you? Not yet. You want it yet? Can I be the first? Go ahead?

[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.660]
Bag it. Thank you. Hey, Neil. Yeah, you're the king. You're the best and the queen and I want to give a shout out

[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.540]
Yeah, for my friend Vito the meter cutter. Oh, that's right. Okay, and I was just me. I'll tell you that how's your mother doing? Okay?

[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.000]
Don't great. Is she still around? She's just still around. All right. I hope your bank gets fixed. Okay. All right. Me too

[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.060]
There you go. Now do I want blood to be sure that what I didn't ask him. He was a holy old wasn't he?

[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.000]
He was a spick. Oh, yeah

[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.600]
Got a lot of spicks out there, man. I'm gonna tell you something those spicks. Those are the good people. Okay. Those are the clean people

[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.420]
What do you think they got that spicking spam from?

[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.940]
Those are the clean people. They're the ones that keep it clean. Of course they have to work harder to do it

[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.560]
But they keep it clean. They scrub it. They rub it. They wash it. I use a lupa. They mostly rub it

[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.760]
That's where they get that pecorino from baby. You want some serious cheese? Go down a little Havana. You can smell it in the air everywhere

[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.260]
I have no idea what I'm talking about. I have no clue. I'm so wound up. I think it's this food. I think my blood sugar is stabilized

[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.300]
Finally, then great food. Then thank you speaking of good food. Let's talk about Mama Mary's again. Okay

[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.640]
Mama Mary's now there's another one that begins with a bee. I don't want to say bobbily

[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.520]
I don't want to talk about the other one. I'm like and forget about that. It's a bread show. It's it's direct

[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.720]
If you want to go to the supermarket and get yourself a real pizza crust

[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.580]
Made from the best ingredients cholesterol-free. They use pure honey no sugar no crap

[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.740]
Just a real great honest to goodness pizza crust seven inch or twelve inch then pick up a mama Mary's you take it home

[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.240]
You smear on your olive oil. That's the secret. I'm telling you try somebody who's spent enough time in Italy to be a real whop

[00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.000]
Okay, you're smear on your olive oil you put on your sauce you put on your mozzarella you put on your toppings

[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.780]
You preheat the oven you're sticking in there for ten minutes and you have got a

[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.120]
Delicious pizza you're not gonna believe. I'm not the yank in you. I'm telling you this is really great stuff

[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.000]
Far a million times better than any frozen you've ever had and even much better than a lot of that delivered crap

[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.640]
You get and of course each crust has a no-spill edge that lets you bake your pizza without a pan

[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.100]
Right there on the thing in the oven so it really has that baked in the oven taste

[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.980]
So give it a try one time you're gonna be stocking up on a whole lot of these for the family and the friends in whomever

[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.280]
Mama Mary's gourmet pizza crust. They're easier. They're faster. They're better for you and less expensive by the way than the competition

[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.340]
Pick up your mama Mary's gourmet pizza crust in the deli section of your local supermarket

[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.740]
This is five sixty q a m

[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.120]
I like on five sixty q a.m. You know the funeral for Diana

[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.220]
With this whole big pseudo-religion thing religion had nothing to do with it. Here's Elton John sitting there at the piano

[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.980]
Ah, how can a trinic singing this thing and here's Tony Black getting up there reading from the scriptures

[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.980]
But he could have been reading from Grimm and Spiritedales. They didn't make any difference and

[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.280]
You know, what is that all about and then of course the the brother gets up there

[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.920]
I mean did we including me did the whole world get sucked in by this asshole or what?

[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.960]
He gets up there when he's talking about the paparazzi and about your last moments in bapaban with this

[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:25.600]
Condescending attitude and the evil paparazzi. He wants to set it 65,000 god damn paparazzi. I kind of like the way he said it

[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.520]
And then not so rotsie and the stokker rotsie

[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.680]
And by the way, what's the difference between a serial killer and a spree killer?

[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.600]
That's another one I forgot over the summer when the kunanan thing was going on all the talking hits since they really

[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.680]
This this was one of the best and you notice how fast that thing disappeared other than they opened up the files

[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.560]
The other day and found nothing made a big deal about that

[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.060]
You notice how fast that story went away you want to know why

[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.180]
Because they don't know anything

[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.920]
Because other than the people who were his friends in San Diego and knew him before other than that

[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.100]
Everything that happened from the time he left there is all conjecture

[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.500]
Including that movie they made

[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.660]
With Stephen Bauer wasn't Stephen a net. Oh thank god. He's circumscribed

[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.380]
Stephen was in that our buddy stevy ra key etgevarria he was in there

[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.380]
And then the kid they had played kunanan it looked a lot better in kunanan did by the way

[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.880]
I guarantee you that kid would not have gotten turned down by jack Campbell

[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.640]
But at any rate and then there was that paperback book and I yes I got sucked in

[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.500]
I mean a lot of time on planes a lot of reading

[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.200]
I got the paperback book today it came into bookstore

[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.120]
Andrew kunanan in the story the piece of crap

[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.860]
Some wop wrote that he don't know Andrew kunanan from Andrew Jackson

[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.500]
from Keith Jackson

[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.540]
And nobody knew from nothing

[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.660]
But anyway getting back to the brother he turns out to be an asshole

[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.040]
This guy turns out to be in his wife

[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.660]
It ran in a family I guess they were all sticking their fingers down their throat

[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.000]
Their family was keeping our brains up

[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.340]
And he gets up there and he's lecturing he's lecturing the winters those miserable German bastards

[00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.900]
You know masquerading as british the Germans are bunch of Germans is explaining you why they look like that and they act like that

[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.960]
The only one who's having a good time is fill up he screw and everything that moves he's having a good time

[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.400]
Daddy I want to see the spice girls. They're right

[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.380]
Isn't that something what a joke that is

[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.360]
I think William I think he's gonna be one of the spice girls before he finishes

[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.720]
Oh brother what a what a simmiss that was and then you know and he just has this divorce

[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.140]
They fight out the guy the wife was puking and he was cheating on her and he was screwing everything that moved

[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.640]
Which also runs into family and he's up there lecturing the papadazzi in the world and by the Windsor family

[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.180]
They're all a bunch of crap and they had more money than god too by the way anyway

[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.420]
You know they got all that big all that big property up there that balmoral

[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.460]
Which is more than just the racetrack in Chicago by the way balmoral is in this huge estate with

[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.400]
millions millions of dollars

[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.800]
And that's all theirs

[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.500]
But they were nice enough to let the boys hang out there while they were grieving

[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.920]
While they were counting mommy's money

[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.620]
1215 on 560 qa m is the world continues getting sucked in by you know tami fae is that in here yet?

[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.820]
No, oh that's got to get in here because as much of a bitch and as much of a overmaid up baker as she was

[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.860]
And a co-conspirator and a psycho babbling idiot

[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.820]
That line where she says the media is sick and each help badly which is on the thing there by the way that she's I gave you

[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.260]
um, she's right

[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.020]
We got a bunch of lunatics who are you know

[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.640]
They're manipulating the whole god damn world and telling people all this is important

[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:33.780]
And the nanny is important in those septuplets. Oh my god. This is a wonderful thing that people are over reproducing like a bunch of cockroaches like a bunch of rabbits

[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.320]
Like I said the other day leave that to the ethics and let's let the white people stick to two kids

[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.760]
Here's a in fact, I think we saw us they're doing what they do in China

[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.100]
What is it one or two? I think it's one isn't it or two? It's one now

[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.700]
And if you have a second one you have to throw it in the river right and if you have a third kid

[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.440]
That's it

[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.360]
Good idea here's a mobile in deer field hello

[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.780]
mobile in deer field gone

[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.460]
Well, he had a way through the break and through the monologue and through the lecture and the psycho he's not gonna hang on here

[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.720]
What are you dreaming they can't hear nothing here's a mobile in Miami hello

[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.740]
mobile in Miami

[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.840]
See none of the mobils are gonna be there at that point

[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.220]
So five six seven oh five sixty five six seven oh five six oh

[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.700]
Let's do

[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.740]
North Miami hello

[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.700]
Going for four to go for four in a row. Okay, let's try for four here's four lotterdale. Hello. Yeah

[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.780]
We finally hit one all right

[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.240]
I'm just a poor white kid with a regular phone. Uh-huh listen

[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:41.760]
I was just wondering you think we're gonna be bored and bombarded with the Kennedy crap now that this other kid bit the dust

[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.800]
No, I don't think so. I don't and nobody cares who cared about this guy

[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.820]
This is the one that was banging a 14-year-old babysitter right with it seems like whenever they get a chance to jump on the Kennedy

[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.000]
Crying, you know all that crap about you know there. I'm sick of it. I won't want you know

[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.220]
I was a big Kennedy fan. I got sucked in and I still think you know Kennedy was a pretty good president

[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:04.300]
If we didn't pay attention to Marilyn Monroe and the fact that he was screwing Giancana's girlfriend and the fact that so yeah

[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:11.340]
Everything else you know I wonder it's it's all when you start reading real history and you start realizing that it's all bull crap

[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:16.560]
And it's all just a facade and underneath they're all a bunch of crooks and when you start reading about the old man

[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.260]
Joe Kennedy the worst maybe the biggest gangster of them are he's the worst. Yeah, you know the thing I don't understand

[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.280]
Neal is that you know these presidents senators their men

[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:34.600]
You know and they they have flaws and I can't believe the big deal that people make over the fact that I mean if that's the worst thing

[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.500]
The man did yeah, you made a beltry. That's right. I mean before he was president. He was a man

[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.640]
I say Frank Gifford for president and that's what men do he's too old

[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:49.760]
Yeah, I mean well man like to screw around a lot. What's wrong with that and the fact that he's got a different job shouldn't matter

[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.160]
It's right. Okay, man. Well said. Thank you. You got my vote cool. Yeah

[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.200]
It's right nobody cares about who's screwing home. They like they want to know about it

[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.700]
But they really don't care about it

[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:06.960]
As they say in their heart of hearts and I'd like to know who came up with that expression because I hate people who say in your heart of hearts

[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.280]
Bob well, oh she say that was one of hers. Oh, do I hear you?

[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.580]
Oh, what kind of a

[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.780]
Don't pick on Roseanne by the way, they had a great the peace on her the other day

[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.660]
On MSNBC once in a while they have a good thing on here not very often

[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.440]
Usually they have John Gibson sitting there and looking like a mannequin

[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.800]
But they had a good thing on Roseanne Rosanna Dana

[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.280]
Which it's hard to believe by the way that she was married to Gene Wilder

[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.280]
In fact, it's hard for me to believe that anybody was married to Gene Wilder. Here's a mobile in South Miami. Hello

[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.660]
Neil yes, sir another thing about that Diana bitch. Yes

[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:45.600]
Okay, she's such a great mother how come she sends a kiss off the boarding school and she's off halfway around the country

[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:52.540]
I'm calling in the back of a limb. That's right. How come she was out there on that yacht with that multi-billionaire with that with that Arab figure

[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.180]
Who was spending all her daddy's money on doping everything else on fast cars

[00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.760]
Yeah, how come nobody wants to talk about the fact that she was gonna give up all the charity work this year

[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:06.160]
That's getting bitch. She was gonna quit right and one of the thinking bitch. Yeah, I say one more thing. Yes

[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.020]
Brian Murray in the late words of Rocky Etter Veria

[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.340]
What a hole

[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:13.960]
Okay

[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:23.700]
Oh, so when is that couldn't animal be coming out by the way? I mean a story is the story is colder than Versace's body by now

[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:32.660]
You know, and then the days that followed the Giannis murder there on the beach and I saw all these local shows on air and there were the our friends remember ocean drive magazine

[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.320]
And they were very nice to watch and I mean they got a good sense of humor

[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.300]
But of course they were afraid I guess they were gonna lose a lot of business now that's terrible. I shouldn't say that

[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:47.020]
But they they were tight with him because they're into that artsy farcey faggy. You know that it's it's all part of that thing

[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.920]
You know George you are money and Versace and

[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.760]
Calvin Klein now there's at least Calvin Klein's got good taste

[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:56.840]
Right

[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.300]
Yeah, it's okay

[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.780]
At least if he picks out some adolescence in underwear at least they look pretty good most of them

[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.040]
As opposed to these real real bizarre asexual

[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:14.860]
Unic look in the things that they put in these fashion shows then you see the fashion shows and you see the women wearing these ridiculous

[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.840]
Brawlapsacks and you think who the hell would wear those things who would wear these are and of course the answer is nobody

[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:20.880]
Nobody

[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.980]
Except for some of these newbie hoi-yi-twiti multi-millionaires who hang them in their broom closet

[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.480]
Yeah

[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.540]
Right like Diana that's fucking bit jazzy another one. How'd you like to see all the how'd you like to see all the outfit?

[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.920]
She had in her closet, huh?

[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.620]
We did shocked them an auction them off remember yeah, she's auctioning that's right

[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:43.840]
She auctioned them off and then this guy over here this pick is auctioning off the furniture at the houseboat where Conan

[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:49.280]
And was a here is a debate little yeah, how is it that he's got the stuff? What does that? I guess nobody wanted it

[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.840]
They were thrown it out because it was a lot of surprising little business man that's

[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.160]
I would have more power to him. He said you know, I think there was something up there

[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.280]
I think he was probably feeding him and he knew he was in there

[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.240]
But in the meantime look at all the embarrassment and all the money. He said the FBI and the police

[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.140]
They'd still be looking for this spagot. They'd still be looking for that crazy son of a bitch if it wasn't for this little

[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.500]
Spick and then of course he had to go through a big thing to get the reward. What is that all about?

[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:18.020]
Thank God for John wall. That's all I have to say. You know, I used to hate John wall. I don't know why

[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.520]
Because I thought he was exploiting his kids murder

[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.880]
Of course he was

[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:28.160]
But I do like that show that's a good show. Maybe I'm just like him because it's a good show in the front of kids head in the canal

[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.080]
You know, what would you do?

[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.700]

[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.660]
Well, it isn't that far. Not a good location

[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.240]
It's 15 minutes from the center of town from why?

[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.860]
15 minutes from the center of town. Okay

[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.520]

I live in Spain part of the time and I spend quite a lot of time in Italy. You live in Spain? In Spain, yeah, don't they?

[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.500]
I thought everybody knew where my bear was. No, not me. I'm just a dummy. I'm just a dummy. Oh

[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:41.600]
Very smart. Let's talk to the local from right to the north. I'm a dianist gown. Yeah. What is your people?

[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.120]
I forget what his name was that I wouldn't be done those things anyway

[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.040]
I'm too big for the key said in any way. I'm a queen if you was only a princess

[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.740]
There you go. I thought it was a very funny line. That was beautiful

[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.680]
Yeah, yeah

[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:58.280]
Also your friend Wayne who I just like intensely and I just like it personally

[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:03.620]
Because of his change in name Joe Robbie stadium, which really would not have it wasn't first Joe Robbie

[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.560]
You're not only wouldn't we have the stadium? We wouldn't have the baseball team

[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.120]
We probably wouldn't have any more football team. That's right Joe Robbie

[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.580]
We didn't like a lot of things about Joe including the fact that he was anti-semitic

[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.200]
But let's face it without having

[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:23.080]
Joe Robbie. Oh give me a break. He was a good catlick boy. Oh, was he really? Yes. Yeah. I didn't tell me told me he was

[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:28.080]
Well, I'm not from far to you. In fact, he was he was so non-Jewish he might have even had foreskin

[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.400]
But guarantee he was not Jewish. Oh, okay. He learned something very important here today, sir

[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.880]
That's right. We had the you know we had our own problems. We had

[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.620]
Oh, it belonged away. He built that stadium with his own money. I believe in some other people's

[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:47.540]
Okay, Wilson have a great day. Okay. We have two open lines five six seven oh five sixty five six seven oh five sixty

And before him we had Myrlansky

[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.620]
So we got a few bad apples in every bunch. Okay. We sure as hell don't have to take credit for Joe Robbie

[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.240]

We're still kicking and it takes a look and and say how to John Cameron Swaisy for me

[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:17.820]
Open line at 5 6 7 0 5 6 the 5 6 7 as as the call went on he started sounding older. You know what's that?

[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:23.380]
I don't want to say we don't want to talk to old people on this show, but uh, we don't only do the thanks for calling lady

[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.380]
We make an exception for

[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.520]
And by the way, I have a feeling

[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.240]
I thought I thought I saw her in the thing here. I got a wrong there she is

[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:37.320]
Okay, here's Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. What is this? I want to welcome you back to the radio. Thank you so much

[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.580]

Nice people swallow yeah, you like that. I love it. Oh, can you say something about how you're spotted?

[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.140]
He's back in the political arena again. Why did they let him out? Or didn't you know?

[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.180]
I thought they had him in a rubber room somewhere this now the mayor of Miami like I don't know that

[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.880]
Well say something about it. He's doing acid

[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.980]
He is yeah, when it was mayor the first time he was doing ass now. He's just doing acid

[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.920]
Okay, okay amigo. I'll read it out. I read that. Ciao

[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:24.180]
Okay, or is it for Joe Conroyo man? Just when he was starting to get his brains unscrabbled and do a halfway decent job

[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:28.180]
And we had a few bucks in the city and I would get this man and there's acting like a madman

[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.740]
He's breaking down in tears. He's firing this one the chief of police. He's doing too good of a job

[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.760]
That's what happens when you let a bunch of fascists in there running your goddamn government

[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.820]
Next thing you know, they'll be digging up the teased his body and bringing him back to Miami-Dade County

[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.960]
Miami-Dade County my ass. Oh god. Is this a dumb place?

[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:48.960]
Miami-Dade County

[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.140]
Here's a mobile and four-letter deal hello

Also, we need to get some this

[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.080]
Just bloodborne here which you use to get everybody including my

[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.020]
I don't want to know yeah because there's a lot of things a lot of issues has been

Get in there and I can't be and have us so we we have a little bit more things to talk about in this town

[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:33.700]
All right, we appreciate your time guy and and like I say happy new year and welcome back and have a great 98

[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:39.000]
Amigo YouTube guy. I'll read it out you bye. Right. Ciao. Okay. We're gonna be doing a show on a tagging starting very soon

[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.420]
By the way, I think on Monday

[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.380]
I was gonna do it today, but I don't want to take up the time and I don't want to piss off Hank

[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:47.620]
Okay, I don't want to do a close day show because then you know, he'll think that we're tuning the audience out

[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:53.020]
What we're trying to do is get Hank such a gigantic lead in since he was already number one an afternoon drive in the last

[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.200]
Trans-last book and for quite some time now that he's like number one half

[00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:02.360]
Because that's what we want him that's what we aspire to be here on QAM is number one half in midday and afternoon

[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.840]
And number like maybe one in the morning and in the evening. Well

[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.480]
That's another now. I was gonna play the best record that's ever been made

[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.420]
Because during the seventh see I really didn't go on vacation during the seven months that I was off that I got my paid vacation

[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:19.400]
I just sat around listening to every record that's ever been made and then of course

[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.900]
I decided which is it when I decide that's the definitive word

[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.540]
No, that nobody would argue with it. I have the best record

[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.540]
What oh back to our boys. Yeah, I like the back to our boys

[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.880]
Those good boys and kids they love God and Jesus and holy moly

[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.320]
This is the best record that was ever made

[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.540]
It's easy to highlight that the best not the best pal

[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.180]
That was ever made

[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.260]
I'm not gonna play

[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.180]
You don't agree that this is the best record in history. It's a very good reaction by a hero's

[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.580]
Very good this record

[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:58.000]
The his performance on this song is enough to make my

[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.920]
I like it. It's very good, but you don't think I don't think it's the best

[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.740]
In 45 and there's you know, they're just they're fine. There's nothing wrong with

[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:21.720]
Well, it's a good thing that I got these ear things on my ears. You see the steam coming out of both of them right now you little spick

[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.180]
You're not can arrow Smith now you idiot

[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.820]
I know there's nothing there's nothing there's just fine

[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.200]
There's a great there's a great there's adequate they're adequate, huh?

[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.840]
Like you you can relate to it adequate

[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.800]
Isn't that isn't that what El Pichino said in dog day afternoon adequate adequate

[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.880]
He was waving a hanky adequate adequate

[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.080]
Or was it a calivate? I'm not really sure

[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.700]
By the way here on St. Catherine Street, Montreal. They got a gigantic gildo and the frogs are hopping on it

[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.960]
That's what I heard that's a rumor about one of our Ojan provocateurs who are faggots that caught early in the show today

[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.680]
He was special. He was good

[00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:03.340]
Pro 38 and 560 QAM are you hungry? Are you really jones and out there for something really good to pop in your purse and maybe some food too?

[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.040]
Are you tired of fat foods? Well Wayne's got the solution to both questions not that Wayne by the way

[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.880]
We're talking about our friend Wayne Wayne Arnold's one and only world castle at

[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:19.220]

[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.440]
Prepared right in front of your puss and if it's cooked in sight, you know it's right

[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.820]
Wayne Arnold uses blue ribbon ground beef in the Royal Castle burgers

[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.660]
Try their Rochester red and white huts with Wayne's own homemade Italian meat sauce

[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:34.940]
All of their over a hundred food items are served every day 24 hours a day even on suckers

[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:38.400]
Including breakfast. Don't forget to Wayne Arnold's Royal Castle. They never closed

They provide warm-friendly old-fashioned service and old-fashioned prices with a winning smile for incredibly satisfying taste visit

[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.180]

[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.660]
Right?

[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:10.740]
This is all the parades in the marching and the smearing and the carrying on during the funeral

[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:11.800]
um

[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.800]
Not really a parade what do you call a funeral procession whatever the hell they call it

[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.980]
So princess Edward. I mean prince Edward

[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.820]
You notice how they kept her in the background?

[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.920]
First of all, he's developed this big bald spot even worse than mine and number two

[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:30.420]
They're a little uh because they're all they all have these great reputations as woman are as womanizers all the men in the Royal family

[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:31.560]
the winters

[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:38.720]
And the princess Edward unfortunately a little bit off a little bit off key just a little bit on the other side of the fence

[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.420]
So they kind of like keep him way in the back

[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:44.900]
And of course that bitch that was married to the other queen what the hell is her name Margaret?

[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.120]

[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.900]

See we just had to break in their gun. They're always going to be gone on there after the break because they can't hear the break

[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.260]
They can't hear the spots

[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.180]

Well listen just relax okay, don't start being a technical

Perfection is now because we're doing the best we can and this keep in mind. This is paradise to the other joint over there the cow pasture

[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.700]
So just keep that in mind who you have no idea. I do have an idea

[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:46.620]
Here's a mobile and four-letter. Hello. Hey, oh god. Yes, sir. You know, I'm happy new year sir

[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.720]
Hey, I'm here. You're here. You know what a great way to start the new year on a goddamn near Roger show

[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.300]
Exactly. I mean where else could it be better than this?

[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.840]
Right, which is bad because I got to go to Arkansas next week. Oh forget about that

[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.980]

[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.500]

Well, I know my sister all my life

[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.020]
That is why she's now my wife

[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.880]
And I think my son may know it's true

[00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.020]
He's my nephew too

[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:06.080]
Well my daddy is my uncle Joe the mother is my dear and

[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.740]
Oh, it is very plain to see my first cousin is me

[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:31.100]
Oh

[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.620]
Okay, let's go to Kendall on what I'm three hello

Hey, okay, no one two three here's Kendall. Hello. I'm I'm here. Okay, no other way to my radio for you

[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:46.640]
Yes, sir. Uh welcome back. Thank you. It's so good. I'd hear you. I'm so happy. I would almost say it's good to be back

[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.160]
And it is you know during this December, January, February, March

[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.320]
Where the hell are you going to go and travel and have good weather anyways? You know as well be here working your ass off

[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.740]
Well, I'm just glad it's been a desert recently and that's right

[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:04.200]
This town learned to appreciate what a what a breath of fresh air I was when I was gone for seven months. Yeah

[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.520]
I only listened to Greg on once and that was it

[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.320]
That was I couldn't believe what they had on there and I knew I'd listen to what I would hear

[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:15.640]
I mean after you hear the description of his girlfriend's bomb moments the first 20 or 30 times

[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.420]
That's that's basically got a pretty good picture of what it's like

[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:24.620]
Yeah, that's that whatever. I'm just happy. I'll be here yet welcome back. I do have one one shameless request

[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.260]
Uh-oh

[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:30.880]
But you don't like it. Oh go me. Oh okay party takes a dump when you play that and you came back

[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.160]
Is that I heard yours? I boy

[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:38.840]
Can you play a bagpipe with the idea? Okay, how about that instead? Have a great day. Thanks

[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.940]
See what they don't understand is it's not a question to do I want to play stuff?

[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.380]
It's a question of do we have our fingers on it and the stuff too? That's the question

[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.560]
As we're working frantically now

[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:53.160]
I realized that the uh the people here only had seven months to get the stuff together

[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:58.340]
And it wouldn't have been any fun if we would have had a couple of weeks leeway and walked in here and everything was set

[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.920]
We were all set up to do a real show. It's no fun. The audience is used to kind of piecemeal

[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:07.520]
Oh, we don't have this we're not we're working on it because otherwise you got everything already and then you play it once

[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.300]
And it's gone now they have something to look forward to here's pember pines hello

[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.800]

[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.480]

[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:54.120]
You've got some freaking nerve man go back to skokie with a band you on your anus

Here's Miami. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. You're the best. How do you like that? Uh, you I don't know how we can treat you

[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.620]
to hang up on

[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:11.180]
Anyways, I'm glad you're back in town and I'm well I'm glad you're back on the radio

[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:17.420]
Um, now we got a hockey expert back in town so I could ask you some questions and get your opinion on go right ahead

[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:21.320]
Sir, you get the answers right here. Did you happen to see the senators brewing game?

[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:26.800]
The unbelievable zero zero uh, you know something I turned it on during breaks in the Rose Bowl

[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.220]
And quite frankly as little as I like college football the Rose Bowl was a million times more entertaining

[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:36.940]
Than the coma. I mean between Dale Arnold doing the game which puts you in a coma even during a good game

[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.340]
That was just pathetic that it was an embarrassment there were some good saves in the game

[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.740]
But I just wanted to ask you question, you know, I'm sure you're aware of you know

[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.900]
The scoring is way down in the NHL, you know something I say leave it alone

[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.720]
I realize the scoring is down

[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:57.320]
Don't start messing with the game. I hate these people. They want to eliminate the center red line

[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.080]
They want to raise the net two inches

[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:05.120]
I think I think I think the easiest thing to do there are two things that have been suggested that makes sense

[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:11.360]
Number one is on a penalty even a two-minute minor you leave the whole two minutes on there many many years ago

[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:16.500]
They used to do it that way and are they changed it you leave the whole two minutes even if a team scores that way can score more than one

[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:21.820]
Goal on a power play and number two cutting down on the goalies equipment now last year

[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.480]
Some of these guys especially guards no one to flyers. He was wearing

[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:31.260]
Shoulder pads that even Joan Crawford would have been embarrassed by it would cover the whole goddamn net

[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.760]
How the hell can you score a goal when a goalies weren't equipment?

[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:39.660]
I say get those pads shaved down and no more of the big shoulder pads and let's get back to a real game

[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:44.580]
I got one thing for you and I'll tell you another good idea get the goalie and take the mast off like they used to be real man

[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:44.980]
Hey

[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:52.260]
Neil's I'm here. Okay. Neil's God and that means Ray Whitney's Jesus. All right. Take it easy. Go see him

[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:57.880]
I'm speaking of the Boston Bruins. Where the hell? I mean Dale Arnold doing the Bruins game

[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.840]
We have to have an investigation

[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:03.300]
I'm gonna go up that I'm gonna move up there for a few months and conduct my own personal private campaign

[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:10.540]
So that we get Fred Qsick to come out of retirement the Bruins are having a pretty good year after mission to playoffs last year for the first time in 400 years

[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.820]
And Fred Qsick goes in and retirement. They got a pretty good pat for ins there

[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:20.560]
They got a pretty decent young team and we've got Dale Arnold who is a stale as last year's Mata, okay?

[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:24.360]
Doing the games and Fred Qsick went in to retirement at least two years early

[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.280]
21 seconds left face off to the right of Tugnut

[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.300]
Those score

[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.380]
First period Mueller now against Oats

[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.800]
That's a roll off shot

[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.540]
Oh

[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.540]
Directing one up in Boston were 18 seconds left

[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:49.180]
The great Fred Qsick one of the greatest ever and by the way speaking of great since I have this particular mini-disc in there

[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:54.300]
Anyway speaking of great announcers who know how to make a game exciting especially a playoff game or an important game

[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.600]
And maybe Christina might be listening now on the way to the airport or wherever they're going. I'm sure he is

[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.380]
Even though we protest a lot

[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.440]
This business of one the other team scores a goal practically like whispering and mumbling like well

[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.840]
It's insignificant. I got news for you man

[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.840]
You have a lot to learn pal. Even though I don't think it's ever gonna happen the great announcers

[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.900]
They knew how to make a team a goal exciting in a game exciting

[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.720]
Even when the other team was scoring a goal jackass

[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:40.740]
Not for the leaves and here's the leafson answer

[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.040]
But it's a playoff game

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:50.740]
It's in Detroit and makes the game really exciting as opposed to these other guys who think they can mumble their way through a broadcast and pretend that we think that they know what they're doing what on

[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:51.680]
Exactly

[00:38:53.800 --> 00:39:01.200]

[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:32.860]

Could you imagine and bishop if you were still alive?

[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.660]
Doing the news on channel 10 with a stogie inner push? Oh, it's great. That would you write?

[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.220]

Excellent point. Well, no, I just I just wanted to know it's what you thought about it because I see that you are very

Yesterday was Thursday and I knew years almost never comes like quite in the middle of the week like that

[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:40.680]
And all day yesterday I'm thinking god today is Sunday

[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.780]
Or today is Saturday, but definitely not Thursday

[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:47.920]
Now today feels like Saturday to me

[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.960]
Doesn't it today definitely doesn't feel like Friday like Shabbos

[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:55.640]
Which is coming up soon and by the way if you're celebrating Shabbos

[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:56.920]

[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:54.180]
I have to confess I don't get a chance to catch your show that often because I'm usually working and in a position where I can't turn the radio on

[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:59.080]
But I'm gonna try and catch you now. I think you have some really interesting comments. Yes. I do

[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:06.800]
Particularly your one phone hockey. I tried to get on the other day to tell you how much I agreed with your Brian Murray comment and Ray Whitney

[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:15.200]
Oh, I was totally disgusted. I'm sick and tired of seeing the guy sitting on the bench also and I really liked the way you say what you think

[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:20.940]
Well, you know that you notice it you notice it didn't happen yesterday. No, it didn't happen yesterday and in overtime

[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:25.340]
It was Ray Whitney was out there who made a great job to keep the puck any offensive zone

[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:31.200]
Split a lovely little pass over there to Ray Shepherd who stuck it right in front and there was Robbie finally twice in the same

[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.000]
The same game in the right place at the right time and of course the first goal

[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000]
It was Whitney who made a phenomenon a little quick flip pass to need a man further that who stuck it in there

[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.360]
Ray Whitney is God and you know you can pretty much predict with your eyes close

[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:48.740]
If the guy is going to be in on something and it doesn't take a hockey expert to see it

[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:54.060]
I mean I'm a real Florida panther fan of only missed five games home games in five years

[00:47:54.060 --> 00:48:00.120]
They've been on the ice and I follow them on television and I really really appreciate when I hear people like you

[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:06.140]
You know really nailing things like that and and you know, I don't know if they've done any statistics

[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:10.760]
But I don't think we would be anywhere right now if it hadn't been for

[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:15.200]
Are you can may we be Whitney somewhere already, but I can't say it on the air yeah

[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:20.800]
That's right we'd be up creep without a panel we'd be up spits Creek and all the way marks bits

[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:27.360]
I wanted to get in before you I want to tell you first how much I appreciated your show and how much I'm enjoying it

[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:31.600]
I'm home on Christmas vacation right now. I'm a teacher. So that's why I really can't watch the

[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.020]
God bless you. God bless you. Yeah really

[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:34.720]
But I

[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.660]
I'll have a good

[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:40.320]
Yeah, I'm the Debbie on a mobile. I know I know

[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.140]
You did know that okay

[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:46.720]
I don't tell you that I don't mind anybody because at least you understand the game

[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.300]
But why do they always put you on first? Is this a game you have with them or what? No, you know

[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:56.100]
It's funny because I intentionally try only to call like every fourth game because I don't want to

[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.520]
I don't know Debbie come on

[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:03.300]
No honestly, there's been a lot of the promo you even made that in sipid promo

[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:06.940]
They put on the abortive arena. I was I might be talking to Debbie on a mobile

[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:11.920]
My husband and I were sitting there and we looked at each other and I just about fell off my seat

[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:15.520]
Yeah, because you know I have a neighbor that calls in all the time by the name of

[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:19.380]
Lou and it's like well he calls and I heck of a lot more than I do

[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:23.340]
Yeah, see they're picking on you there's shining the spotlight on you and making you out to be a chronic

[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:30.140]
But at least I know anybody that knows that Brian Murray has been blowing it and that Ray Whitney is God can't be all bad

[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.320]
Well, thank you, but

[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:36.980]
I'm gonna say well we're undefeated in four we're three oh and one we're hot as it we're into playoffs

[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:40.860]
You know he's gonna start hacking a China. I don't want no excuses Brian

[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:45.520]
I want the good players to play and I want the bad players to get on a bus meaning Kirk Mueller

[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:53.100]
And you notice that Fred Qsick bit I played when they did the face off you notice who lost the face off before the Bruins scored the goal

[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:54.200]
Kirk Mueller

[00:49:54.200 --> 00:50:00.260]
Yeah, it was the guy that lost the face off and but I'm being rolled off stuck it in there in the Bruins scored because Kirk

[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.320]
Mueller was a disaster

[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:05.400]
Yeah, that's a ticket and should be right behind you see him skating figure eight yesterday

[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.880]
Yeah, I did he was skating around his circles

[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:13.180]
And you know I was listening to the callers on on that last on the last penalty and it was like well

[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.880]
It doesn't matter that it was an overtime who cares

[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.760]
I mean I was waiting to see the rest ignore it

[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.720]
Listen, we've gotten screwed so many times

[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.940]
I'm not gonna complain that they called one an overtime

[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.500]
Especially on Doug E. Gilmour who my love but nevertheless

[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:32.040]
You know better him than anybody else and you know that I really don't understand why that should even be an issue because

[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.620]
So what if it's an overtime? I agree

[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.940]
I agree and the way it happened to us we've lost game

[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:41.180]
I mean I can I can see in the last minute or two of regulation

[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:44.940]
But when a game gets it over time if there's something that merits being a penalty

[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:49.120]
It's a penalty. Yeah, and thank God for Kerry with a good Harris-Bray Fraser

[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:54.820]
All right, well listen keep up the good work and I just didn't want you to harass Randy because he doesn't know me from

[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:59.960]
A mole on the ground and I didn't want to know you're from a mole in the ground. Yeah

[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:04.080]
Oh, that was not planned not plan but anyway

[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:08.960]
I enjoy your show. I enjoy supporting his show and I really don't want to

[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:12.180]
Randy just the other day and he said what was that I said just a little slip of the tongue ring

[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:15.000]
Have a great day Deborah happy new year

[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.240]
He had all bad she a little chronic but she's okay

[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.040]
Ray Whitney let's just throw him in 13 goals the best point now in the world

[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:27.040]
Given away from Edmonton used to be a stick point. He's that high the best point guy I saw him last night

[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:31.620]
Unbelievable 13 goals as he's been and nobody's talking about him all spare that

[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:34.800]
Stu Barnes has gone that Ray would come in now you're unbelievable

[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:39.780]
Yeah, just a little guy wears a mask. They still like Dougie Gilmore on the points been pretty super too

[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:44.920]
Dougie's been good. Dougie, I love you, but you're Ray is better right now 13 goals. Yeah

[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:45.720]
Yeah

[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.800]
There you go. I rest my case

[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:53.460]
107 let's do a mobile in Miami. You know, so I'm doing these time checks again

[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:58.220]
Even though it's an a so it'll screw up the best up tapes. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Oh Neil. Yes, sir

[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:04.260]
I have a digital color. I'm right. I'm calling you because I'm so happy to hear you on the radio again

[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:07.040]
It isn't even funny. I know it is funny. I mean

[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.800]
You know there's nothing on the radio when you're not on the radio

[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:14.680]
You might as well take the radio and put it in the bottom of the turlid when I'm off the earth

[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:18.920]
I mean other than Rick and Sudden who like their show I have to confess like I said

[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:28.660]
But other than that there's there's nothing on I'm glad you're back and I'll be a loyal listener and I support all your

[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.620]
All your your people there your advertisers all my people right and

[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:39.940]
And I love to smoke cigars so keep it up and give these people hard time all right all right

[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:45.760]
Have a great day pal. You too happy new year. You too, buddy. You too. See I can't stand you too though, but that's a good guy

[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.920]
Okay, yeah, I had something really important. I wanted to play already played that

[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:55.300]
Already played that I'm so far ahead of myself. It's almost disgusting. Oh, I haven't played this though

[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:59.640]
Which we will get to in momentarily. Okay, let's go to Miami. Hello

[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:00.940]
Neil yes, sir

[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:07.960]
No, I did not they were doing a spot with Mickey Dane making predictions

[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:14.580]
Yeah, you predicted that Marv Albus was gonna come to Florida and have a new career with Neil Rogers

[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.360]
Yeah, isn't that something that's real cute. Let me ask you who's with the V

[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:28.540]
Uh, I don't know, but it was Angela Ray that said it all Angela Ray. Well, there you go. It speaks for itself at miserable bitch

[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:30.400]
Really? Okay, thanks for the good news

[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:36.100]
Elton John and Bernie top it have just returned to the studio and have completed the tribute to Marv Albert

[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:37.820]
Goodbye Marv's career

[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:42.320]
featuring such hits songs as candle in my butt. You're done

[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:45.920]
Carpet man and the heart felt Betty bit my butt

[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:53.660]
You love the ballad don't go yanking my part Elton John's tribute to Marv Albert goodbye Marv's career

[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:57.840]
All proceeds go to the society to prevent synthetic hair

[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:04.420]
Okay, open line five six seven oh five sixty if you're one of those zillion people who have been tried to get through these first through

[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:10.080]
Through days five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty. Well, that's the way I stick this cigar

[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:17.000]
It's the angle that I stick it in in a cigar too. Here's the lady in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. Hi Neil. Welcome back

[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.880]
Thank you. Um, I'm in Tony 11 Fort Lauderdale and I've been trying to head up the first ever hockey

[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.240]
Booster Club in Fort Lauderdale with a Florida panthers

[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:33.800]
Spend for the last three and a half years and I'm getting nowhere and I've had some meetings with some of the hockey people and Declan Bolter and those guys

[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:39.460]
And I'm still getting nowhere. I mean do you think this town will ever let us have a booster club for the far to panther?

[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:42.600]
I don't know about that, but I know the fans are sure behind the team

[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:48.000]
They're behind the team. They were all whipped up into a frenzy and we finally played a pretty good game

[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.880]
And we finally won a home game and a crowd was pretty much into it. Yeah, I like that crowd

[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.740]
Yeah, so tell me why does he uh

[00:54:55.320 --> 00:55:00.660]
Whitney on the bench in the last period or given 20 or 30 seconds of ice time because he's the anti-Christ

[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.460]
That's right

[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:10.360]
Ryan Murray is the anti-Christ okay make no mistake about it. You can tell by looking at him. Yeah exactly. I look at him and I say anti Christ

[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:12.260]
Yep

[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:20.740]
Well, keep working on it sweetheart. Okay, and I'll keep trying on my booster club. Keep working on it. Thanks and the club too. All right good luck

[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:21.420]
Thanks, bye

[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:26.400]
Okay, she'd be working on it. Hey listen, you got to in this town, you know, it's a bunch of deadheads

[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:30.100]
I mean they may be a little bit enthused, but they don't want to go overboard because they live here

[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:37.240]
And who can blame them? It's 11 after 1 on 5 60 Q a.m. And one more time in fact this would be a good idea over the weekend

[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:41.140]
In fact probably a lot of people are party pooped out at this point and

[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.560]
If you want to do something real easy right there in the kitchen

[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:47.320]
All you got to do is pop one of those mama marries gourmet pizza crust in the oven

[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:50.600]
It takes only 10 minutes to have a great pizza just the way you like it

[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:55.420]
That's right. Take home one of those seven inch or 12 inch pizza crust and again these are real pizza crust

[00:55:55.420 --> 00:56:00.080]
Not bread shells not like that other who's with a b-thing and your brush a little olive oil

[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:03.580]
And then you spread on your pizza sauce and you put on your mozzarella cheese

[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:08.120]
And then you put on your meatballs and your sausages and your paperoon and whatever you like on that pizza

[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:13.860]
You pop it in the oven only 10 minutes. You're ready for a fantastic pizza a billion times better than any frozen

[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:18.420]
You've ever had and amazingly better than much of delivery you pay to the nose for each crust is

[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:23.580]
He didn't got a nose-bill edge that lets you bake your pizza right there on the things on the racks without a pan

[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:27.000]
And mama marries uses the best ingredients like pure honey instead of sugar

[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.800]
And they're absolutely cholesterol-free to their less expensive than the competition

[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.420]
They're easier. They're faster. They're better. They are delicious

[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:37.200]
So I was a little skeptical when I started but trust me after trying a few of these

[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.420]
They are really great even George loves them and would you like to have some more for free?

[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:44.440]
Mama marries pizza crust look for them in the Delay section of your local supermarket

[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:50.120]
The Neil Roger show now exclusively on sports radio 560 QAM

[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:54.560]
It's the holiday season and that can only mean one thing for all you sports fans

[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:55.420]
It's time

[00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:01.160]
Here's uh now shouldn't one of those be saying next or probably is peppered pines but it isn't saying next

[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.800]
Isn't that interesting? Is it or is it my uh, magnation?

[00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:10.660]
That's very funny. It is very funny because all six of them are just seeing their very quietly and none of them say it

[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:14.780]
We'll take the mobile one too. Not that I really care. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello

[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.580]

Listen up. I'm really well. I hope you are. I hope you are. Listen up. You know what?

[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.380]
I'm really getting sick. Entirely these Brian Meriantix

[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:37.180]
You know what I got I guarantee you three games from now when we use like two games. Hopefully we won't

[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:43.420]
But I guarantee you Brian Meri is going to start messing with the chemistry stuff putting Ray Whitney on the third line on the second

[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:47.380]
On the third on the first you know and and that's the way that's the way Brian Meri operates

[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:51.200]
And you know what I I hope to God well actually you

[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:55.700]
Now we bring it Teddy Nolan from out of out of retirement or

[00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:00.080]

[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.580]
Open line 5 6 7 0 5 6

[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.160]
This is now in Pember of Pines

[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:20.020]
