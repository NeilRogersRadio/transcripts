[00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.440]
I know that.

[00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:02.300]
Oi!

[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.220]
I picked up to you.

[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.880]
All right, well, I at least have a great day.

[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.080]
Let's take the cream to you.

[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.580]
Talk to the big.

[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.500]
OK, and have a great day.

[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.420]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 0.5, 60 on a mobile one line.

[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.500]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.600]
Hey, Neil.

[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.000]
This is your buddy from the hockey game.

[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.340]
Well, this is that asshole Mitch?

[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.680]
Oh, now I'm not interested in you, OK, asshole?

[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.240]
Here's the guy.

[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.760]
I wasn't even going to mention this because I don't want to dignify him.

[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.280]
I don't want to dignify him when he's coming.

[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.000]
And see, this is one of the reasons it's so hard for me to talk about hockey,

[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.900]
although I will for a couple of minutes and a bit here about this Peter Wurl business.

[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.160]
But this guy, we go there the very first night.

[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.380]
Here's the beautiful arena.

[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.540]
We go in there.

[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.320]
It's just spectacular.

[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.120]
Remember comes by and says, hello, I see some of my old friends.

[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.380]
But who's the first person that comes over?

[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.160]
Is this asshole who walks up to me?

[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.480]
Do you know who I am?

[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.520]
See, that's like that very jackass thing in Toronto with the airport up there.

[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.060]
As soon as somebody says, do you know who I am?

[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.500]
You know beyond a shadow of a doubt.

[00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.260]
He's an asshole.

[00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.620]
Right.

[00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.700]
Because what does that mean?

[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.700]
Do you know who I am?

[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.740]
No, I don't know who you are.

[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.240]
It looked like just some ordinary puts me and it's this Mitch guy chronic.

[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.360]
He stands there for ten minutes.

[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.740]
Pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat.

[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.400]
Oh, you're I'm the reason you've got ratings.

[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.540]
But I said to him, how did I survive all those years before you showed up here?

[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.940]
He's the reason I've got ratings.

[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.340]
No, you're the reason I've got hemorrhoids. That's what you are.

[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.100]
I'm not interested.

[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.280]
OK, well, I'll talk to you.

[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.160]
You're a putz.

[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.920]
You're a jackass.

[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.420]
Nobody wants to talk to you.

[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.880]
You're worse than Andy from Hollywood.

[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.720]
You're worse than Greg from Pointe and Beach.

[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.920]
Now, Port St. Lucie, wherever the hell he might go.

[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.500]
That's right.

[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.380]
That's that's Mitch.

[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.380]
He is the ultimate.

[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.380]
He's the worst.

[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.080]
The guy with the eyes is a picnic.

[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.920]
He redeemed him.

[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.460]
No, seriously.

[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.080]
We can forgive the sinners.

[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.660]
He redeemed himself on Saturday.

[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.940]
He's a great guy.

[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.100]
He's a sensational guy compared to you, Mitch.

[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.240]
You're a misfit.

[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.280]
You're a putz.

[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.460]
You stood there for ten minutes and pat pat pat pat.

[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.300]
And you know something by the time the ten minutes was over.

[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.280]
You still didn't say a goddamn thing.

[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.000]
You're another guy with no life who wants to play off of using this radio show

[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.400]
to give yourself an identity.

[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.100]
You don't need this show because with or without this show, you're still a putz.

[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.400]
So you don't need me to have an identity.

[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.960]
You know nothing about what you're talking about.

[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.520]
You have nothing to contribute.

[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.660]
And I had even said to you, if you call the show and you want to talk about, you know,

[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.920]
like a like a bench and talk some hockey, that would be a breath of fresh air.

[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.120]
But he doesn't want to do that.

[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.760]
He wants to be a little celebrity.

[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.160]
Oh, you know who this is?

[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.260]
Yeah, real asshole.

[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.820]
Anybody going to talk hockey on his show?

[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.060]
I'm the one who'll talk it because I'm the only one in this town

[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.560]
and pretty much knows what's going on.

[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.040]
Outside of the people associated with the organization.

[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.440]
And some of them don't know what's going on.

[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.640]
Boy, oh boy, oh boy.

[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.400]
I'm telling you, I'm, you know something.

[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.160]
Them putting that show on last night at 1030.

[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.220]
The Monday show instead of the one from yesterday.

[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.000]
That's the greatest service that they've ever done to me over there.

[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.500]
That's the last time I'm actually meant by the way.

[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.720]
But that because it just started the wheel spinning in my hand.

[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.720]
I said to myself, what am I getting all bent out of shape about this for?

[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.440]
I don't give a crap about Maddie Leshum.

[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.520]
I don't give a crap about these people if they call or they don't.

[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.800]
You know, just like last night, you know, I come in this morning.

[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.360]
I said to George one hell of a crowned air last night at the Appetsal.

[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.440]
He says, oh yeah, and see he's thinking of the three or four misfits

[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.720]
that showed up there last night.

[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.640]
Three or four.

[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.040]
That's all there were.

[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.020]
Now I'm talking about real, I'm talking serious misfits.

[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.600]
Okay.

[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.300]
Serious.

[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.500]
Besides Jeff Cohen.

[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.680]
Serious misfits.

[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.280]
As a poet, but the overwhelming majority which there was a hell of a lot of living and breathing.

[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.300]
Young people there last night.

[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.540]
There was one guy from you of them.

[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.700]
You of them know this.

[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.740]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.220]
I didn't think we had anybody at the you of them listening to this show.

[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.640]
Because anybody who listened to this show knows what I think about the you of them after years and years of experience with that whole organization on it.

[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.220]
Barricade.

[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.020]
Ing blow.

[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.500]
Right.

[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.020]
But this guy was like a bright living and breathing guy.

[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.660]
I had young people coming over to me saying, hey listen, don't ever stop doing what you're doing.

[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.120]
It's great.

[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.980]
And don't ever let anybody muzzle you in.

[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.340]
Okay.

[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.060]
It was great.

[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.300]
So that's the way I looked at it.

[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.280]
Not that we had like three or four misfits there.

[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.240]
Or five or six or seven or eight.

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.580]
Are you counting L for two?

[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.780]
Three I thought.

[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.180]
Boys, he getting big.

[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.340]
Al, we love you, but God, are you a giant in the porno industry?

[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.400]
Ten minutes after 11 at five, six.

[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.100]
You a.

[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.740]
Am.

[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.580]
Holy Makin'ah.

[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.240]
This is Joe Boyle on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the Hockey Authority, Neil God.

[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.140]
This is Hank Hill on music.

[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.680]
I just heard that song by Barricade Ladies called One Week.

[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.900]
First off, let me just say this.

[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.920]
Slow down.

[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.260]
I couldn't understand almost nothing.

[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.420]
I think you said something about Chinese chicken.

[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.700]
And then I heard the word sushi.

[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.620]
What the hell?

[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.820]
Now I know why you call it one week.

[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.040]
It took me that long to decipher the first line.

[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.680]
I'm Hank Hill on music.

[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.680]
Thank you.

[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.960]
I think week was the opportunity of wearing.

[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.600]
Okay, it's 11.16 at five.

[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.060]
60 WQAM on a really neat Wednesday.

[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.680]
Here's I start reorganizing and putting my life back together again.

[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.580]
Don't forget Sam, the promotion man, he'll be our QAM van.

[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.420]
Be looking for it.

[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.820]
At the Hooters at Pines and University.

[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.560]
He's got T-shirts.

[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.500]
He's got Neil Buttons.

[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.160]
George is better than Tape's Buttons and Rikia Glacier's Goodies posters, T-shirts, pictures.

[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.180]
And maybe some old stained underwear.

[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.620]
And who knows what else he's got hiding there in the truck.

[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.580]
Here's Port Lauderdale.

[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.840]
Hello.

[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.200]
Hi.

[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.700]
How are you doing, Neil?

[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.080]
Okay.

[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.020]
Maybe I'll give you some insight into the acons diet because I've been on it a couple of times in my life.

[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.460]
Give me some insight into what?

[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.800]
Yeah.

[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.100]
I lost 65 pounds and about three and a half months back when I was in my 30s.

[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.400]
Yes.

[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.180]
It's called a drinking man's diet, man.

[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.680]
And I've met far back in.

[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.980]
And I just recently did it again, lost 30 pounds.

[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.700]
And now what I do is I don't stay on the diet, but I really restrict my carbohydrates.

[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.520]
I've gotten back to eating some fruits that are low in sugar.

[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.360]
I eat a big, I scoop it out.

[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.220]
I don't eat pasta.

[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.460]
But you don't have to stay in that ketosis state and maintain your weight of that.

[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.100]
Of course not.

[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.800]
I'm maintaining it for about three years now.

[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:09.160]
Right.

[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.220]
So that this...

[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.300]
It's the SS, sir.

[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.180]
Those are the killers.

[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.620]
The SS, sugar and starch.

[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.460]
Those are the killers.

[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:14.780]
Yeah.

[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.900]
But you can still take a small amount of it.

[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.000]
If you still keep your carbohydrates, I try to keep it down under about 80 or 90 a day.

[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.380]
Yeah.

[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.640]
80 or 90.

[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.480]
I used that three or 400 before.

[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.160]
80 or 90.

[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.280]
That's after you lose the weight.

[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.920]
You're not going to lose any weight to an 80 or 90.

[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.560]
You're not going to lose the weight.

[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.700]
Right.

[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.220]
Yeah.

[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.200]
So that does allow me to...

[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.120]
I've a talking about your call.

[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.460]
I called about how we love the bagels.

[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.200]
I just scoop it out if I eat it.

[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.540]
Uh-huh.

[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.580]
And it's...

[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.020]
It's a...

[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.640]
It's a stop fruit juice in the morning and a stop high sugar fruits and all that kind of stuff.

[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.700]
And it's...

[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.520]
It's possible to enjoy everything that you want until maintaining your weight on the diet.

[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.960]
Okay.

[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.560]
Okay.

[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.260]
Say, how do I...

[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.580]
Okay.

[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.980]
Here's North Miami Beach.

[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.260]
Hello.

[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.100]
Hi, Neil.

[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.700]
Yes, sir.

[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.520]
I had a chance to meet the last five people off.

[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.720]
It was a pleasure meeting you.

[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.160]
I think it's a great thing you're doing with cancer once.

[00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.800]
Yes, I am.

[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.780]
And I hope that I don't see again that one of your pipes.

[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.460]
Okay.

[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:03.960]
Five.

[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.800]
Thank you so much.

[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.760]
By the way, the center one number you can go or do your best to Neil Las Cedis and cassettes by calling them direct if you like.

[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.940]
954-5633-600.

[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.480]
954-5633-600.

[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.200]
I wouldn't give you the real good information about it in order on our website, NeilGod.com.

[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.000]
But unfortunately,

[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.100]
and maybe he might be listening to us today, or maybe we might send a search party out.

[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.400]
You know, I hate to knock him because he did such a great job for us putting that website on there.

[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.040]
I mean, he knows Stupendous Job for free, Julio Benito.

[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.100]
But he's found a life and he's doing other things and he's not doing his computer stuff anymore.

[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:40.560]
But we're supposed to be in touch with George's last couple of days since the first week of our campaign is basically coming to an end in a couple of days.

[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.620]
And I would love to have that on there on our website, but unfortunately you won't find it on there on our website because we can't find Julio.

[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.020]
Does anybody know where Julio is?

[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.380]
No.

[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.060]
I'm not talking about just any ordinary pedestrian Julio.

[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.180]
I'm talking about Julio Benito.

[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:53.900]
Anybody seen him?

[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.060]
No.

[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:54.920]
Anybody heard from him?

[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.060]
No.

[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.100]
Anybody can find him.

[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.220]
No.

[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:56.960]
Not a search party.

[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.820]
Come on, let's go.

[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.860]
Because that's really, can you imagine how much we could be raking in?

[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.120]
We got people listening all over the goddamn world on the audio net.

[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.940]
And people checking out the website.

[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.400]
We need to get that on there.

[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.620]
Like today would be good Julio.

[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.740]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.220]
We don't want to screw up your busy life that you got a real life.

[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:13.820]
Now that's great.

[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.020]
And our next appearance by the way will you on Saturday, October 31st, Halloween day.

[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.640]
At Ben and Jerry's in Aventura between 2 and 4 p.m.

[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.300]
Or are they going to be picking out at Ben and Jerry on that day for Halloween?

[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.220]
Mm-hmm.

[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.780]
They're going to be doing their New York Super Fudge chunk and their fish food

[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.380]
and their chocolate cherry garcia frozen yogurt.

[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.880]
And I'll be watching.

[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.080]
Here's a mobile in the gables.

[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:38.380]
Hello.

[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.760]
Yeah, what's up, Newell?

[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.200]
How you doing?

[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:40.760]
Okay, sir.

[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.340]
I was just, I heard of something that a Howard's parents getting in trouble or something.

[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.420]
And I was wondering if you could elaborate because I've been able to like watch the news for anything.

[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.120]
I don't know anything about it.

[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.240]
Now, I just cut like a glimpse of it last night on the news for whatever.

[00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.180]
A glimpse of what?

[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:58.840]
What are they saying?

[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.320]
They said that he was setting up calls for something, fake calls,

[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.140]
and some of his radio stations might use it as an excuse to drop him.

[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:07.540]
Mm-hmm.

[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.020]
And I thought you would know about it.

[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.740]
I had no attention to Howard.

[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.660]
He gets a lot more, all the publicity he needs and then some without my help.

[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.820]
Oh, I know.

[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:16.520]
Okay.

[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.500]
No, no, hold on.

[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.200]
I have another thing.

[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.800]
I'm talking about your students.

[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.040]
I'm a your student also.

[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.040]
I'm a lost student there.

[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.480]
And I've been listening to you forever, though.

[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.780]
And one point.

[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.500]
That guy that just called about prune juice.

[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.420]
About prune juice?

[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.080]
Yeah.

[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.220]
That guy that was giving you his diet, how to, how to, how to, he said prune juice?

[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:37.980]
Yeah.

[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:38.780]
Yeah.

[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.360]
That's just the perfect elaboration of Howard.

[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.120]
Okay.

[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.660]
Thank you.

[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.280]
Okay.

[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.820]
We have two open lines in date one and brown.

[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.260]
56670560.

[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.760]
0560 on the mobile one line.

[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.420]
So the national hockey league is reviewing the racial incident.

[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.800]
Here's a big story by David J. Nealahal, people who tends to be a little dark and collected

[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.160]
himself.

[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.920]
And it's interesting because he doesn't put like a defensive spin on this.

[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.520]
This is a guy who wears his Afro-Conner Al uniform and his Hussade Shaco to all the

[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.300]
Panther games to cover them for the hero.

[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.060]
But evidently, isn't quite as militant and some as some I'd be because he kind of from

[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.880]
his perspective in here says this is much to do about nothing.

[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.940]
And maybe I'm reading into it, okay?

[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.420]
But at any rate, it says the NHL has interviewed all participants in Friday's alleged racial

[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.700]
incident involving Pantheos forward to the world and Tampa Bay, Darcy Tucker and St.

[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.820]
McArtheid, but doesn't expect to reach a decision today.

[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:34.800]
When I told them, they asked the world, what I told them is what I knew which is nothing

[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.320]
said, world, 21 year old black Canadian.

[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.560]
I didn't hear anything.

[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.760]
I didn't see anything.

[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.160]
I don't know exactly what happened.

[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.540]
Here in a way, he don't know.

[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.520]
He didn't hear nothing.

[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.620]
He's not the one that's all been out of shape about it.

[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.860]
And the Panthers didn't videotape the game, but Tampa Bay did.

[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.920]
The Panthers said they wanted to copy, to send a colon, Campbell, the NHL's disciplines

[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.960]
are to review the attack on Fordous Rob Needomire by Tampa's Andre Nazarov and Zara.

[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.600]
Tampa sent the tape all the resources to tape his foggy during the third period.

[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.240]
It's a little on the foggy side.

[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:08.040]
But it goes on to say from the press box at the top of the 8,000 seat Jacksonville Colosseum

[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.120]
and this is David Jane.

[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:09.900]
You'll write in this.

[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.920]
It appeared that after Nazarov jumped Needomire with a series of cross checks and punches

[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.620]
to the back of the head, a pile up and suit against the far boards in the Florida zone.

[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.680]
Meanwhile, at the bench, Whorell and McCarthy began drawing at each other, saying to

[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.620]
McCarthy, by the way, being the boon of Tampa Bay, to use the play for Calvary.

[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.900]
The arguing continued and they were given each 10 misconduct.

[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.180]
Tucker was already in the Tampa Bay box.

[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.420]
As Whorell and McCarthy continued their debate, Tucker put each of his hands under the same

[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.080]
armpit.

[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.020]
Like this, under the same side armpit, which I don't know if it's a side armpit.

[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.640]
Do you have armpits anywhere than on your side?

[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.700]
I don't think like this.

[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.820]
It goes on to say that gesture was read by Brian Murray to be a ton of Whorell as an

[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.100]
ape-like creature, but says David Jane, he'll from the press box.

[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.500]
It also resembles a child indicating a rival is chicken.

[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.520]
Isn't that what people usually do like that?

[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.540]
Like that.

[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.540]
That means chicken.

[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.760]
It doesn't mean ape-like.

[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.960]
Wait until you hear the rest of this.

[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.460]
I think maybe BM is lousian.

[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.460]
He's got a little bit carried away.

[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.860]
Which it says that's a trible indication that a rival is chicken, which is how the lightning

[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.560]
later said they felt about real-not fighting.

[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:21.260]
Tucker also stuck an index finger in his mouth repeatedly, which Murray thought was making

[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.460]
fun of Whorell as a banana eating ape.

[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.280]
Now keep in mind, this isn't the Tampa Bay guy saying this.

[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.660]
This is Brian Murray's interpretation of the events that took place on the ice-hop.

[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.440]
They're in Jacksonville.

[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.680]
He thought it was making fun of Whorell as a banana eating ape.

[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.920]
So they're doing like this, right?

[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.160]
Like chicken because you won't fight the big guy.

[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.540]
And like that, like meaning choke is what I would interpret it to be.

[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.420]
But Brian Murray, Shesh, it's making fun of him as a banana eating ape.

[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.520]
Lightning General Manager Phyllis Pizito, who's a real asshole by the way,

[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.920]
called the incident an attempt at game is mentioned by the Panthers.

[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.840]
This is typical Panthers bowl, he said.

[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.020]
They're trying to get us off our game because we're playing them in the opener

[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:01.760]
Friday night.

[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.640]
So it's Brian Murray who's saying all of these things.

[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.780]
That it's a racial incident.

[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.680]
I mean, that line, I can't believe that anybody would say that.

[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.300]
Tucker also stuck an index finger in his mouth repeatedly, which Murray thought was making fun

[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.580]
of Whorell as a banana eating ape.

[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.140]
If I went like, uh, what?

[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.260]
To you, would you think that I'm saying that you're a banana eating ape?

[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:28.680]
No.

[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.740]
Is that the message there?

[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:29.900]
No.

[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:30.720]
If you did it?

[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.240]
Oh, yeah, that's true.

[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.020]
Banana eater.

[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.180]
I'm the banana eater.

[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:35.640]
I'm sorry.

[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.080]
Everything else.

[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:36.760]
Okay.

[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.320]
Here's a mobile and coral spring.

[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:39.720]
Hello.

[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:40.960]
Morning, Neil.

[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:41.360]
Yes, sir.

[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.040]
How you doing?

[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:42.400]
Great.

[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.160]
You know, if anybody knows about hockey, it's you.

[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:45.780]
You're the man.

[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.440]
I'm the maven.

[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.260]
You're the man.

[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.520]
I'm going to get off that subject.

[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.660]
You remember that, uh,

[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.100]
quickly.

[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.640]
Okay, it's the biggest deal with Bob Lincoln.

[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.260]
Bob Lincoln, yeah?

[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.040]
Yeah, you're a link.

[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:56.840]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.180]
Don't call him a banana eating ape just because he's the missing link.

[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.480]
Because he didn't pay for the gas.

[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.580]
We got stuck in the airport.

[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.180]
Oh, I remember.

[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.340]
I know the whole deal.

[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.340]
Are you playing in another deal with him or?

[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.940]
I'm not planning another one of those deals with him with anybody, uh,

[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.380]
anytime in my lifetime.

[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:11.980]
No chance.

[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.480]
Okay, I got another question for that.

[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.620]
Those two, those three trips we did to Vegas.

[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.020]
In fact, I should be put away for the fact that it was second one.

[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.180]
And then to do a third one with that rocky rent to Rio, whatever your name was.

[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.080]
I mean, I must have been out of my mind off my rocker.

[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.000]
But once we got off the plane, we had a hell of a deal.

[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.360]
Yeah, once we finally got there, it was sensational, right?

[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.540]
God, I remember that.

[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.840]
Uh, do you think that we have a chance to legalize gambling with anyone

[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.320]
in these candidates that's, uh, uh, for governors?

[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.640]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.020]
No chance.

[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:39.780]
No chance.

[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.820]
No, no, we gotta find somebody done.

[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.060]
Okay, good luck to pal.

[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:44.680]
I'll see you in Vegas.

[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.500]
That's, uh, going to find not going to happen, man.

[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.640]
This is like the guy to call me before about you.

[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.100]
I know it's depressing.

[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.380]
It's something you don't want to accept.

[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.920]
It is not going to happen.

[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:53.640]
Read my lip.

[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.620]
Okay, the ones who doesn't have a little cold, so run it.

[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:56.360]
Read my lip.

[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.640]
Oh, yeah, that's the cold floor.

[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.740]
We're not going to get no casino gambling in this state

[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.200]
because it's a backwater state that's run by a bunch of

[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.480]
Bible-fumping red necks and by a bunch of old parts

[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.500]
who don't want us to interrupt their, uh,

[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.380]
the stranglehold they have on his town.

[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.400]
That was one of the great parts of our appearance

[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.520]
at Pizza Loth last night.

[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.660]
The median age was, I would say, about like 25 or 30.

[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.680]
The people that showed up there.

[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.380]
Did we have hardly any old parts there last night?

[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:22.720]
No.

[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:23.940]
Unlike maybe a couple.

[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.140]
Living and breathing people under the age of 100.

[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.680]
Oh, I said, this is great.

[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.660]
These are the people I want to talk to.

[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.700]
Not the old people that got 40 pounds of cotton

[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.800]
betten between their cheek.

[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:36.260]
Rectome.

[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.480]
Whichever cheeks it might be.

[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.100]
Forget about that.

[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.460]
I wasted my time with that for five million years.

[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.800]
I knew I had blue lips.

[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.880]
Can that sit done?

[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.520]
Help me with my blue lips.

[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.420]
It's 11 to 1.

[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.960]
Like I said, don't take no lip from anybody.

[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.380]
That's my philosophy at the show.

[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.360]
Love a Q-A-L.

[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.780]
Kill the cold.

[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.040]
32 at 560.

[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.300]
W-Q-M got hanged from a shoelace to at.

[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.020]
Yeah, these people like that got your tell me,

[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.120]
but I got to get those people on the air.

[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.140]
The old crusty fart, the one that's getting the injunction

[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.960]
and the little judge with a mustache and a wrinkly hair.

[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:11.840]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.340]
To get me off the air, I love that.

[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.160]
I love those people just like that Christian lady

[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.280]
that called a few days ago.

[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.240]
Those are my favorite callers of all time.

[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:19.880]
Those are the best.

[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.740]
Because when you stop and you listen to those people,

[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.440]
you realize that they're certifiable

[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.380]
that they need to be in a rubber room someplace.

[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.480]
It's like the dog that sits out there

[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.760]
being at the moon, howling and screaming,

[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.780]
hoping that he can make the moon go away.

[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.400]
Instead of like just a dittle around,

[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.320]
sticking his tail up in the air and walking in the other direction

[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.520]
and going on with his life,

[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.040]
he sits there screaming at the old moon,

[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.320]
hoping it'll go away.

[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.080]
And I'm not going anywhere.

[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.100]
So find something else.

[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.060]
Find another occupation.

[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.300]
Go read the Bible.

[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.660]
Go hand out Bibles to dying people in hospitals.

[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.100]
Go out there and spread the word.

[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.780]
Go to the jungles of Africa,

[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.780]
the deepest darkest jungles of Bangladesh,

[00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.880]
and hand the people out there the good book

[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.940]
to get them the words.

[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.280]
You can save them before it's too late.

[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.680]
Do something constructive.

[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.100]
Just like I told that them Christian bitch.

[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.860]
Who by the way, I think did try to take it up the record.

[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.940]
It's having a good time, which is why we didn't hear from her anymore.

[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:14.840]
And she made promo.

[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:15.940]
Oh, there you go.

[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.840]
You too can make promo if you're entertaining as she was.

[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:20.240]
That's right.

[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:21.340]
Woo!

[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.120]
Yeah, that was my favorite.

[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.600]
Oh, oh.

[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.420]
Yeah, in fact, that's what she said when she...

[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:26.700]
Recko.

[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.460]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:27.960]
Oh.

[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.260]
But you notice you said it with kind of like an enjoyable sound there.

[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.440]
Like, oh, it hurts so good, you know, that kind of thing.

[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.400]
So I think she's going to be doing a lot of that.

[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.340]
And if you keep doing that,

[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.020]
sweetheart, you'll be burned at Lake Afair.

[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.380]
Make no mistake about that.

[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.820]
See, it's very simple.

[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:46.560]
There's a phallon.

[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.440]
In fact, we're going to get the button guy came by,

[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.700]
by the way, our button guy, what's his name?

[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:50.660]
Jeff.

[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.100]
Jeff, I haven't seen you in so long.

[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.400]
He's a great guy.

[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.300]
Jeff, our button man, he made up some great buttons,

[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.620]
which have the picture of the front of the cover of our best off CDs,

[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.360]
with the little center one heart logo with the one inside.

[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.380]
We need him to make up some buttons that say,

[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:06.400]
DNH.

[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.520]
I'm starting a new religion.

[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.640]
We're going to make bumper stickers and buttons.

[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.100]
You know how they have the little fish?

[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:12.900]
Well, there are own.

[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.740]
It says DNH.

[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.500]
That's my religion.

[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.820]
Oh, seriously, you heard of DNH,

[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.860]
which of course is the fiber of which all life is made.

[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.660]
DNH means do no harm.

[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.240]
That's it.

[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.000]
Very simple.

[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:23.560]
That's all you need.

[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.880]
Doesn't cost you anybody to join.

[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.280]
You don't have to believe in any saviors,

[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.460]
any supernatural people,

[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.020]
any creatures, any little goblins from Mars.

[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.180]
Do no harm.

[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:34.660]
That's it.

[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.400]
Very simple.

[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.040]
Now, let's move on with life.

[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.360]
And stop arguing about a bunch of bullcrap.

[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.700]
See, you're not going to heaven.

[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.480]
You're not going to hell.

[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.100]
There's no such thing as life after death.

[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.320]
Take the flower.

[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.080]
Take that little seed and take that flower.

[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.740]
And you watch it germinate and you watch it grow.

[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.180]
It blooms and it blossoms and it grows into a beautiful thing.

[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.680]
And then it starts like a wilting a little bit.

[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.040]
And then it starts getting older and decaying and rotting.

[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.420]
And then it dies.

[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:04.640]
It dies.

[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:05.360]
It dies.

[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.600]
Die, die,ina, with dies.

[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.400]
And that's a microcosm of what the life of all living things on earth is.

[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.260]
Some things have long life spans.

[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.020]
Some things have short life spans.

[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:19.960]
That's it.

[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.220]
That's what it's all about.

[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.040]
Anybody tells you you're going to be up there

[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.180]
and heaven did them with the angels up there.

[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.580]
I got news for you.

[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.420]
Maybe Tim Salman and Jim,

[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:30.980]
what's his name?

[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:31.900]
Edmunds are going to be up there.

[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.880]
Those are the only angels you'll be running into.

[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.260]
And now JT's still he's playing for the giants now, okay?

[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:37.860]
No angels.

[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.140]
Nobody playing little harps and nobody's sitting there going,

[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.200]
oh god, you're good.

[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.920]
Oh god, for the rest of their eternity.

[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.500]
I mean, eternity's a long time.

[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.080]
They keep threatening you with this health thing where you're going to burn

[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.260]
in the lake of fire for eternity.

[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.720]
I mean, this alternative also on that good to me either.

[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.540]
Praise in God for all eternity.

[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.900]
Oh god, you're good.

[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:58.660]
You're good already.

[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.020]
You're good.

[00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.540]
You believe me.

[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.020]
You're good.

[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:00.420]
You're good.

[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.340]
That's something I'll know.

[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:01.840]
You're good.

[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:02.920]
Forever.

[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.360]
Let's have lunch now.

[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:04.920]
You're good.

[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:05.500]
You're good.

[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.220]
Don't stop now.

[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:07.860]
Just keep going.

[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.480]
It's all about your crap.

[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:10.540]
Yeah.

[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.940]
So knowing, of course, that people have this tremendous fear of death,

[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.260]
we come up with all these bubble miceys, all these fairy tales.

[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.240]
And then we charge them a lot of money.

[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.360]
We make it into a big business.

[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.720]
And then we use it as a big, you know, as a way to justify bigotry

[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.920]
and pit one group against the other and kill a lot of people who refuse to come

[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.360]
into our, I believe, our bubble miceys.

[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.260]
And isn't it been going on like the guy who called before?

[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.520]
About an hour ago, like he said, since the beginning of recorded time,

[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.420]
since the inventor of the first goddamn stupid religion,

[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.720]
this is what's been going on.

[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.460]
You don't need this.

[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.600]
Do no harm.

[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:41.900]
You don't hurt anybody.

[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.140]
You don't take anybody's property.

[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.480]
You don't hurt anybody's person.

[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.480]
That's it.

[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.020]
That's all very simple.

[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.800]
Do we need anything else?

[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.040]
No.

[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.200]
I mean, if you can do some good things along the way, that's fine.

[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.060]
But that's your prerogative.

[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.800]
You just want to be a schmuck who just goes through life.

[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.320]
Fine.

[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.220]
Just don't do any harm.

[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.680]
That's the religion.

[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.560]
And if everybody in the world would abide by my religion,

[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.880]
which I just articulated to you for the 10 minutes of time,

[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:03.960]
we'd have no wars.

[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.420]
We'd have no persecution.

[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.660]
We'd have no hatred.

[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.480]
Everybody would just do their thing.

[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.840]
And look at all of the resources we would have.

[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.000]
I mean, we can't even get the tax money from these fakers.

[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.600]
Look at all the resources that are being wasted on this bullcrap

[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.380]
to subsidize fakers and snake oil salesmen.

[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.920]
That we could speed all the starving people in the world

[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.420]
and educate the people and do something about the plan,

[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.060]
parenthood, and have like, you know,

[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.180]
not five billion people crawling around on the face of the earth

[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.940]
and two and a half billion of them starving today.

[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.760]
What a concept, huh?

[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.020]
What a concept.

[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:37.580]
Oh my god.

[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.440]
Right, exactly.

[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.640]
Do no harm.

[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.160]
Sure thing.

[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.760]
But we ought to have cards and buttons

[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.840]
and bumper stickers made up with that.

[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.720]
Instead of these stupid little troglolites

[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.880]
with the fish on their car,

[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.320]
I'll give me a break with that crap already, will you?

[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.040]
Speaking of troglolites,

[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:57.860]
Jeff Cohen just came in.

[00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.820]
Don't bring any of that in here

[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.400]
because I'm eating lunch at mommy's today.

[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.400]
Okay, usually it's Tuesday.

[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.760]
This week it's Wednesday because I was at the law last night.

[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.760]
So don't be bringing no food in here, Mr. Food Pusher.

[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.440]
Mr. Rapeni Pusher.

[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.320]
So how'd you wind up doing last night?

[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.560]
QA have.

[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.860]
I can have an orgasm just driving down I-95.

[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:16.860]
Oh!

[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.700]
Guys, where the heart on promenade dolls.

[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.920]
Girl's grab your partners firmly by the balls

[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.520]
drag them down the length of the halls.

[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.480]
Make them holler, make them shout.

[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.060]
What you pretty ass up against is now.

[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:06.740]
First lady goes, second lady pass, third lady finger up the fourth guys ass.

[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:15.720]
Finger out, promenade the halls, now released the poor guys ball.

[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.980]
Down with the petticoat up with the pants,

[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.480]
this is the end of the dirty square dance.

[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.100]
Those who do are wrecking, I'm tired now.

[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.580]
I think I'm looking for where I've made some french fried potatoes.

[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:41.340]
11, 4, 4, 5, 60 WQM just another spy report, the chronic, the old fart.

[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.160]
Called Georgia again out there.

[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.240]
Wish we could get him on a year.

[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.260]
We ought to break into a middle of a commercial break.

[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.340]
Yes, we can't hear out tomorrow.

[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.660]
Just read the Harold tomorrow.

[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.660]
They're going to report that he's dying of AIDS.

[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.680]
That's the news to us.

[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.220]
Because we know that I'm losing a lot of weight.

[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:56.940]
Okay, yeah, right.

[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.340]
Only wish I was losing a lot of weight.

[00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.420]
Let's go to Boca.

[00:23:59.520 --> 00:23:59.720]
Hello.

[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.900]
Hey Bo, hey, it's Mr. Boca.

[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:02.540]
Yes, sir.

[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:03.240]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:03.540]
Great.

[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.440]
Good news.

[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.520]
My brother is getting married and the whole wedding party is going to Vegas for the honeymoon.

[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:09.900]
Great.

[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.840]
Man, we're going to have a good time looking.

[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:12.280]
Yes, sir.

[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.460]
I've been there, but I can't wait to go back.

[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.780]
And we're just going to just live and breathe amongst some happening people.

[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:19.860]
I'm trying to have a good time.

[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.160]
People with big smiles on their push, having a great time.

[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:22.840]
That's right.

[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.640]
Walking around in the middle of the night, not worrying.

[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:25.040]
Right.

[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.240]
So I can't wait.

[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.640]
And I just wanted to say that no matter what they do to you down here,

[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.540]
as far as give you our time, you've got a tremendous amount of people

[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.940]
I'm out on the road all the time.

[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.940]
And you've got more listeners than you can imagine.

[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.140]
And I can shake my thing in.

[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.560]
And we all enjoy it.

[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.420]
And just wanted to give you my support.

[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.440]
And have a great time, pal.

[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.340]
Thanks a lot.

[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.960]
Yeah, you see what got that old guy that old cod, you're fired up again.

[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.120]
You know what he's pissed off and fired up the timing of it.

[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.120]
After I went through my very common sense thing.

[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.680]
And this gets them psychotic.

[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:55.960]
You can't say that.

[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:56.940]
It makes too much sense.

[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.220]
That's what he's really saying.

[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.800]
You can't say those things because it's too simplistic.

[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.540]
And it messes up our plans.

[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.340]
Remember what Tessio said in Godfather 1?

[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.980]
That screws up all my plans.

[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:08.800]
Can't go selling.

[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.860]
And that's what this guy's all been out of shape about.

[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.200]
Because it's very simple.

[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.860]
You don't need all these fairy tales.

[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.580]
You don't need to charge somebody a bunch of money to rip you off.

[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.440]
So that you're going to wind up going to heaven or all this other bull crap.

[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.080]
And get saved from some evil destructive, hateful God

[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.500]
that wants you to burn in the sufferer, etc.

[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.080]
for the rest for eternity.

[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.360]
Which is one of the sickest concepts that anybody, any rational.

[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.140]
I mean rational.

[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.100]
Are we talking rational?

[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:34.340]
No.

[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:39.640]
Any person could come up with people in the people in the jungles.

[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.300]
Oh, we got to get them the word because if they don't get the word in time,

[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.380]
they're going to wind up in hell.

[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.320]
Well, did they have any choice?

[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.960]
No, but don't confuse us with the facts.

[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.780]
Do, no harm.

[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:50.580]
Period.

[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.100]
And leave people alone and stop being so hateful and obnoxious and judgmental and bigoted.

[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.080]
That's what we're asking.

[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:56.980]
Is it going to happen?

[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:57.400]
No.

[00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:57.980]
Of course not.

[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.420]
Just like in Northern Ireland, every part of the world that you look at,

[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.540]
most of the strife, most of the conflict that's going on today

[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:09.720]
and through the ages and from now until the guy that planted is blown up

[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.560]
is because of bull crap.

[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.360]
Because people want to be sheep,

[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.740]
they want to be led down the garden path with a bunch of horse crap.

[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.860]
They want to walk around with those stupid beanies on their head

[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.420]
and they want to walk around and worship a guy with a dress on.

[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.020]
Because the number of people in this world, especially in this country,

[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.060]
you want to think for themselves, you can put on a thimble

[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.740]
and have room for that fat ass old fart that keeps calling you.

[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.500]
Have room for him left over in there, which would be a good place for him.

[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.820]
We could call him Thimbalina.

[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.760]
So just keep getting all bent out of shape and upset

[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.020]
because what, that's your revolutionary, do no harm.

[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:46.900]
Just leave people alone.

[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.160]
Just don't mess with their property.

[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.340]
Don't mess with their own person.

[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.220]
I mean, we'll draw the line at insects.

[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.500]
Self-defense and insects.

[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.520]
For wild animal comes in your home killer.

[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.720]
Okay, even Bob Barker, I think, might go along with that one.

[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.500]
Cockroaches and mosquitoes.

[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.460]
Well, oh, too bad, see you later.

[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.380]
Send them to skier heaven.

[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.300]
But other than that, any other higher life for them once we get about the insects,

[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.640]
have some respect for it.

[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.160]
Leave it alone.

[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.140]
Do no harm.

[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:13.660]
That's it.

[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.560]
I ought to be on Goddamn International TV on CNN right now.

[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.720]
It's the these stupid bitches on their talking economy,

[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.700]
which they know nothing about.

[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.280]
I ought to be on there right now.

[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.740]
Preaching a good word.

[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.700]
The simple word.

[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:26.300]
Ten minutes.

[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.320]
That's all they should give me.

[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.160]
Ten minutes on there.

[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.860]
And I'll tell them what real life is all about.

[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.180]
Do no fricking harm.

[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.100]
The NFH.

[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.280]
Can't put the F in there because then Matthew will get upset.

[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:37.900]
Oh, sorry.

[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.040]
Let's talk about him again.

[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.280]
The NH.

[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.840]
So basically, and I'd like one person, by the way, I challenge you.

[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.920]
And I know you won't be able to do it.

[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:47.900]
I've got challenge.

[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:48.740]
One person.

[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.120]
One of your witnesses out there.

[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.360]
They're calling me and tell me what.

[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:51.820]
That's wrong.

[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.340]
To tell me what's wrong with that is a philosophy for life.

[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.180]
For all living and breathing people all over this planet.

[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.000]
That we couldn't survive a hell of a lot better.

[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.020]
And make this a god damn instead of an outdoor ensana solemn.

[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:09.240]
Make it into a real paradise where people can actually be happy and be fed.

[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.660]
And live a land instead of the madness that goes on here.

[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.480]
People with a gun, the gun nuts and the shooting and the killing.

[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:21.020]
And the people who's making babies like rabbits and their kids are walking around.

[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.460]
Two-year-old kids wandering around in the middle of the street.

[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.780]
These are all the news stories we got.

[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.480]
Because mommy and daddy are busy doing a drug deal or whatever.

[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.720]
And how mommy and daddy are busy doing.

[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.240]
If there is a mommy and a daddy,

[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.160]
which in America now maybe there's a mommy, maybe there's a daddy.

[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.280]
Maybe there's not either one of them.

[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.400]
I mean, if Jody Foster's having a baby,

[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.020]
God only knows what's going to have next.

[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.440]
Maybe Steve Jones is going to have a baby.

[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.040]
Not his wife.

[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:43.720]
He's not just him.

[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.060]
Maybe Steve's going to have a baby.

[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.980]
Because that's what America's all about.

[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.180]
Madness.

[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.580]
I'm not the crazy one.

[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.240]
You people are to pull in this crap.

[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.240]
You're the crazy one.

[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.580]
You're out of your mind.

[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.580]
Believe me that this is the way that supposedly civilized people are supposed to live.

[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.320]
Kids being thrown into dumpsters, into pizza ovens.

[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.420]
Just like that bitch on that old bag of the condom.

[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.320]
Oh yeah!

[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.540]
When they tell her there's a body in the dumpster in the back of her building.

[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.440]
Oh yeah!

[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:15.620]
We're playing bridge.

[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.860]
We're playing my genre.

[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:19.960]
Oh yeah!

[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.980]
There's a dead body rotting in your dumpsterly.

[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:23.740]
Oh yeah!

[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.500]
But we're in the middle of a Maasjon game over here.

[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:28.440]
Wow!

[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.260]
Excuse us for interrupting your Maasjon.

[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.260]
We'll come back when you're done.

[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:32.540]
Okay.

[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.660]
Call us when you're done.

[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.280]
Give us the name of the winner.

[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.600]
We'll put it on a goddamn TV.

[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.260]
And then maybe you want to take a look at, you know, get your gas mask out

[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.720]
and take a look at his dead body back here and see what's going on.

[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.380]
Oh yeah!

[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.400]
Please talk about Sam and Chris before he calls me again.

[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:46.840]
I'm going to ask you to tell me what's going on.

[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.080]
Again, meaning what?

[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.680]
That they're dying over there.

[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.580]
Speaking of dying over here.

[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:52.960]
Over at the Hooters.

[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.880]
So what do you want from me?

[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.240]
Maybe nobody wants any of this stuff.

[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.100]
Maybe nobody's listening.

[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:57.500]
I don't know.

[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.160]
Sam and the gang were over there in the QAM van.

[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.060]
At Hooters on Pines and University Drive.

[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.540]
And they got the QAM T-shirts and Neil Buttons.

[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.960]
And George is better than Tape's Buttons.

[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.380]
And Enrique Goody's poster T-shirts and pictures.

[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.880]
Now maybe that they're there.

[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.220]
And people know that they're there.

[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.040]
Maybe now people make the effort to go over there

[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.660]
or if they're in the area, go buy and see them.

[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.880]
So Sam feels like he's doing something worthwhile today.

[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.340]
I mean, they got free stuff for you over there, okay?

[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.560]
So stop by and make Sam feel like we're doing something

[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.360]
useful and worthwhile.

[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.960]
And like we really have an audience out there,

[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.640]
even if we don't.

[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:27.780]
We don't know.

[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.440]
Do we have any idea if we still have an audit?

[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:29.680]
No.

[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:30.100]
Of course not.

[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.460]
We had a lot of people show up last night.

[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.740]
They all claim that they listen.

[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:33.780]
Do we know if they're listening?

[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:34.100]
No.

[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.160]
They just wanted to be nice.

[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.160]
Here's a lady in sunrise.

[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:38.520]
Hello.

[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:39.420]
Hello.

[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.100]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:40.780]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.420]
This is Jenny.

[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:42.220]
Yes, Jenny.

[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.040]
And we were at the center one benefit last night.

[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:45.240]
Great.

[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.580]
And I don't know if you remember me and Adam.

[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.840]
He had an elbow t-shirt on and anyway.

[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.100]
Yes.

[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.900]
I tell you, you don't have no idea how how touch you were

[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.040]
that you were doing this.

[00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:01.260]
And it just, you know, really touched our heart.

[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.020]
But also, what I first want to say,

[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.340]
we want to become the first official members of your DNH.

[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:06.780]
Great.

[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:07.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.000]
We're on there.

[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.740]
What you're in, that's how easy it was.

[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:12.180]
You're in.

[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.380]
What cost you a dime?

[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.160]
There's no dues.

[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.640]
You don't have to put a shmata on your head.

[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.120]
You don't have to do any mumbo jumbo.

[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.360]
You don't have to buy any books.

[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:19.960]
You're in.

[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.440]
Yeah, this is excellent.

[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.720]
Because you're very important to be on the radio.

[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.400]
Because a lot of people said, let me mentality, you know?

[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:26.880]
Yeah.

[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:30.440]
And people, they just need to know what you think they can think of.

[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.780]
All the killing, all the suffering, all the hate,

[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.960]
all the misery, based on people arguing about a bunch of fairy tales

[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.600]
and stuff that we'll never have the answers to.

[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.900]
Instead of saying, well, we're here.

[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.940]
We know that why can't we just do no harm?

[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.340]
Get along, be civilized.

[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:43.860]
And that's it, and then move on from there.

[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:44.720]
That's pretty simple.

[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.520]
You know, let's try to, let's try to feed the people

[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.320]
that are starving to death.

[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.120]
Let's try to, you know, discourage people

[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.300]
from making unwanted babies.

[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.480]
Let's start doing things that make some sense.

[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.940]
And are these people willing to do it?

[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.080]
No.

[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.340]
No, they're running around the worshiping a guy that wears a dress.

[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.920]
And you know, something's funny when we got home.

[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.560]
We got, I also got something in the mail.

[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.420]
And right on the envelope, it looks like handwritten,

[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.020]
but it's not.

[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.820]
It says, Jesus is going to be passing your home

[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.400]
close to where you will be sleeping tonight.

[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:09.940]
Yeah.

[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.400]
Ready.

[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.460]
So I opened it up, and it has all this funny stuff.

[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.360]
And of course, there's an area there to send.

[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.280]
Oh, it's called sewing on this one,

[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.340]
presenting money, sewing seeds.

[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.400]
Oh, yeah, you have to sew it.

[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:22.600]
Yeah.

[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.080]
Get the needles out.

[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.040]
Yeah, so it's quite entertaining.

[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.380]
I got a little purple and gold prayer thing here.

[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:29.900]
Mm-hmm.

[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:30.380]
Yeah.

[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.300]
I've shot ten real fast if I were you.

[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.500]
I got it quite tickled, though.

[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:37.680]
I'll have to say.

[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.000]
But again, you know, it was, it was so good to see you.

[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.880]
And Center One, Adam had, as we told you,

[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.080]
a partner named Neil also, who, they helped him in their,

[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:49.960]
in their early days.

[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.080]
Carol was very instrumental in that too.

[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:52.460]
Great.

[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.280]
And it's just really, we met up with her on the way out.

[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.420]
And Adam spoke with her for a while.

[00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.000]
Great. Okay.

[00:32:59.120 --> 00:32:59.860]
Good hearing from you, Jenny.

[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.340]
I think we went out.

[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.000]
Well, keep listening.

[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:01.580]
Thanks a lot.

[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.480]
Keep thinking straight.

[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.160]
And bless you.

[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:03.540]
Okay.

[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.020]
Okay.

[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:04.800]
Bless you, my child.

[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:05.740]
Okay.

[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:06.720]
We got two members in.

[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.520]
Anybody else joining?

[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:07.800]
No.

[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:08.120]
Okay.

[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:08.960]
That's three of us.

[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.220]
Two open lines, and day one and Broward,

[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.000]
five, six, seven,

[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:13.700]
oh five, 60,

[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.360]
pound five, 60 on a mobile one line.

[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:16.600]
I'm waiting for the first.

[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.940]
Instead of all I hate to spew an end to Georgia's here,

[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.800]
let's hear some good Christian out there,

[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.160]
or some good Orthodox Jew,

[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.100]
or some Muslim,

[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:24.760]
or some Buddhist,

[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.560]
or some other religious nutcase,

[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.300]
calling here and tell me why I'm wrong.

[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.320]
What do we need all these organizations

[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.700]
and all these institutions

[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.820]
and this massive, massive waste of the human resources

[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.400]
to subsidize corrupt,

[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.240]
crooked, bullcrap?

[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.340]
What do we need that for?

[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.100]
Why do we need mumbo jumbo?

[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.140]
Why can't we just use a little bit of common sense?

[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.660]
Even the dumbest of the dumbest

[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.860]
a little teeny tiny common sense?

[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.100]
I got a little teeny tiny common sense.

[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:52.760]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.040]
Hello?

[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:54.460]
Hey Neil.

[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.900]
I'm about to start your time.

[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.180]
When you go, when you bake a baked potato and you cut.

[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:01.480]
Uh-huh.

[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:01.860]
Okay.

[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.160]
We have an open line and Broward.

[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.320]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, and pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.520]
When I'm talking about baked potatoes and the Edkins diet, okay?

[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.080]
I don't know who started this crap with the Edkins diet today, all right?

[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.460]
I'm the one who like reinvented the Edkins diet after he put the book back out.

[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.960]
I'm the one who made him a millionaire again.

[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:20.060]
The Edkins diet works.

[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:20.460]
It's great.

[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.340]
If you want to do it fine,

[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.460]
if you can stay on it, that's great.

[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:23.300]
It's a way of life.

[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:23.940]
It's not a diet.

[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.860]
If you can't do it like me, then you're fat.

[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:26.640]
That's it.

[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:27.860]
Nothing complicated.

[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.100]
We don't want to hear about it.

[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:29.460]
It's boring.

[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.740]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.000]
Hello?

[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:34.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.700]
Hey, I couldn't agree with you more about the Duno-Harm concept.

[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.780]
I want to take it literally to one point when you start talking about animals and all of that.

[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.540]
If you had, and don't hang up, I mean, please, if you had a cat that was yelling and yelling

[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:52.220]
and keeping you awake all of the time, then you had an opportunity to do away with the cat.

[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:52.640]
Would you?

[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.640]
Rain, for real or you want to make a joke?

[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:57.800]
No, I'm not making a joke.

[00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:58.160]
I'm just saying.

[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:58.840]
Of course not.

[00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.820]
Of course I wouldn't do that.

[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.620]
Well, what if it's disturbed your sleep and you never had enough to eat it?

[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.820]
I'm sure I got it out of there.

[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:06.480]
I'd get rid of it.

[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.900]
I'd make sure that wherever it was, I'd find it another home.

[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.680]
What if the only opportunity was?

[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.460]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:14.260]
What if?

[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:14.800]
What if?

[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:15.220]
What if?

[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.920]
What if chickens' peeds are okay with your driveway be wet?

[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:18.380]
Uh-huh.

[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.020]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:19.640]
What if?

[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.060]
What if?

[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:20.460]
What if?

[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.900]
You're just a moron.

[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.240]
You're just a bozo, pal.

[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.920]
Very simple, but you want to make it complicated, okay?

[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.300]
So forget about the animals.

[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.240]
Forget about them, all right?

[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.220]
Because why the hell?

[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.780]
Forget about the insects and the animals.

[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.400]
Let's try to stick with human beings right now, which quite frankly,

[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.380]
I'm not sure if you qualify.

[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.880]
Let's try to stick with human brains with a brain.

[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:40.940]
Human beings.

[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.020]
Remember Bobby Brie?

[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:44.740]
Good.

[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:45.580]
God Almighty.

[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.700]
I said if anybody wants to refute it and explain it rationally,

[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.540]
got something legitimate.

[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.460]
Not some jerkball out there with a goddamn dead cat, okay?

[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.560]
If you got a pussy problem, pal.

[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.400]
This is the wrong show for.

[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:57.140]
Call Dr. Laura.

[00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.840]
We have an open-line in Broward.

[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.940]
56670560 and 0.560 on the mobile one line.

[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.620]
It's 1156 on the two.

[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.260]
We got the bookshambia at six and then we got the

[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:07.880]
battered gym.

[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.340]
They got anybody over there with Sam and Sam and the nephew.

[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.940]
They got anybody over at Hooters and not.

[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:13.640]
He hasn't called back.

[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:14.320]
Hasn't called back.

[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.800]
We got some people over there, okay?

[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:16.920]
Sam is over there.

[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.540]
He wants to give you some crap, okay?

[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:19.940]
Sam is the expert.

[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.300]
Hooters on pines and university drive.

[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.580]
They got a whole bunch of QAM stuff, such as it is.

[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.700]
I mean, we don't have a lot of good stuff.

[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.720]
We got QAM t-shirts.

[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:28.880]
We got Neal Buttons.

[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.500]
We got Georgia's Better Than Tapes Buttons.

[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.620]
In Rikki Iglesias poster t-shirts, pictures,

[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.300]
a bunch of stuff.

[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.420]
What does wrong with these people?

[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.580]
Oh, they don't want to see Sam?

[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.520]
Come on, get over there before they change their mind

[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.420]
and turn around and go back and Sam starts saying,

[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.380]
oh, there ain't nobody listening to that goddamn show.

[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.560]
Now you're probably right, Sam.

[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.500]
We have an open-line in day.

[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.200]
DNH, maybe anybody else out there want to join?

[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:49.500]
No.

[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.200]
You know harm.

[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:51.060]
That's our new religion.

[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:51.780]
We're starting right here.

[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.320]
Gonna put all these other bastards out of business

[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.700]
because it doesn't cost you a dime.

[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.780]
You don't have to really think a hell of a whole lot.

[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.520]
More than about two minutes about it.

[00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.460]
Makes sense to me.

[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.260]
And this guy out there with his damn pussy problem out there

[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.120]
in his driveway or whatever.

[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.860]
Like I said, call Dr. Lura, call Irene Kassurla,

[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.620]
call up Monica, get out of my face.

[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.500]
Here everything's a big goddamn joke.

[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.360]
Here's South Beach.

[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:15.700]
Hello.

[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:17.940]
Hi, Neal.

[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:19.320]
Oh, God.

[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:20.140]
You're the best.

[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:20.860]
Yes, I am.

[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.020]
Um, take...

[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:22.540]
Oh, shh.

[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.420]
A couple things I want to talk about.

[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:23.980]
You're good.

[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:24.780]
Exactly.

[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.640]
I want to join, man.

[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.840]
It sounds great.

[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.900]
Oh, you remember number three?

[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:30.260]
All right.

[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:30.740]
There you go.

[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.160]
I think I don't know if you're qualified.

[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:32.980]
You remember number three?

[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.720]
Well, you're number one.

[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.100]
Yeah.

[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.460]
The two people were number...

[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.280]
And I'm doing number one and two right now.

[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:37.840]
Yeah.

[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:38.960]
I almost...

[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.920]
He's speaking at number one.

[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.160]
I almost did that when I heard the guy from the

[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.240]
Contrary Day Spot.

[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:43.780]
Do a spot.

[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.240]
Oh, man.

[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:45.860]
The one guy?

[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.240]
Contrary Day Spot.

[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.480]
Like he's tolerant as loud as possible.

[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.380]
You mean Joe Rose?

[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.520]
Joe, how is his spot?

[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.360]
Oh, man.

[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:55.420]
I was as George.

[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.500]
It's going to be good.

[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.360]
He's always saying, how come Joe Rose is

[00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.380]
tolerant here in this spot?

[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.540]
When he does his live spot, see how he's...

[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.900]
And then when he does, he'll be courting his spot.

[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:03.380]
He's tolerant.

[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.280]
I like the wee wee.

[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.620]
Yeah, that's the problem, I think.

[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.660]
Too much wee wee would, Joe.

[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.440]
Maybe around too many deaf people or something like that.

[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.160]
That could be it.

[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:10.520]
Thanks, though.

[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.740]
You can kiss my rear end.

[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.180]
Not bad.

[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:13.960]
We'll pass.

[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:14.800]
Okay, pal.

[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:15.380]
Have a great day.

[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.120]
Go sober up.

[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.160]
We have an open line update, 567-0560,

[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.400]
pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:22.700]
DNH.

[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.400]
The greatest threat to all these

[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.620]
faker religions out there.

[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.820]
All these phony balonies with their hate literature

[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.640]
and their bullcrap and their propaganda and their lies.

[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:31.620]
That's what they do.

[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.140]
Better than anybody.

[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.380]
Like that Ernest Ainsley.

[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.780]
And like that goddamn phony.

[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.920]
What else is named the Benihana Hin?

[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.420]
That's right.

[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.800]
Benihana Hin sounds fishy to me, Mr.

[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.340]
and he's on it.

[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.120]
And he even came on at CNN showing just about admitted that.

[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.560]
It's almost of it's a bunch of fakery,

[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.180]
which we know it's all a bunch of fakery.

[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:49.820]
All these things.

[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.620]
He doesn't even touch him.

[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:51.920]
And they're already passing out.

[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:52.520]
They're grabbing him.

[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.500]
They're falling on the floor.

[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:54.520]
And then they say,

[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.140]
I'll come back and do it again.

[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.260]
And people are sending this faker money.

[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.700]
This is terrifying.

[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.420]
This is unbelievable.

[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.780]
This is even worse than jury springer if that's possible.

[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:08.860]
That these people go on air.

[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.420]
They get all this taxes and status.

[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.220]
They put the little number at the bottom of the screen.

[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.800]
They raise all the money they want.

[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.620]
They become good obedient right wing Republicans.

[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.480]
And they propagonize all day long 24 hours today.

[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.940]
They twist and manipulate the news for fun and profit.

[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.620]
They brainwash the uneducated masses out there.

[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.680]
And they're making tax-free millions.

[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.920]
While people are running our starving,

[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.100]
that we got the fall is here already.

[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.320]
Before you know it's going to be quarter and hell up north

[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.240]
another month or so.

[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:35.540]
Another couple of days maybe.

[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.380]
People are going to be out there.

[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.900]
The homeless are going to be freezing to the starving to death.

[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.620]
And we got assholes in this country sending millions and millions

[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.140]
and millions of tax-free dollars to a bunch of quacks,

[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.340]
a bunch of fakers out there.

[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.680]
And you tell me that this country

[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.700]
has got some degree of maturity, of sanity.

[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.420]
We got this charade going on up there.

[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:54.360]
Here's Wolfgang Blitzer.

[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.100]
A bit of Blitzkrieg again on CNN.

[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:57.840]
Investigating the president.

[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.920]
And at Nazi Trent Lotz got the balls to come up there yesterday

[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.040]
and accuse Clinton and the Democrats.

[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.220]
Well, you know, this is all just a masquerade.

[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.660]
This is just all a side show to try to deflect

[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.780]
attention away from the investigation.

[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.100]
Like it was Clinton who invented all the problems in the world.

[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.840]
It was Clinton's fault that we got this global economic crisis

[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.460]
that they're toppling like a bunch of goddamn dominoes.

[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.600]
The economy's all over the world.

[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.880]
It's Clinton's fault that goddamn

[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.980]
Saddam is over there building goddamn nuclear weapons.

[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.260]
Not George Bush's fault who didn't finish the job

[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.840]
back during the Gulf War.

[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.000]
It's Clinton's fault that they're killing each other in the Middle East,

[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.780]
even though we got Madeline Albright over there again.

[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.000]
They're shaking hands and they're shaking it and rocking back and forth

[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.040]
like Leo Mazadega in the Abrayev's dugout.

[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.300]
That's right.

[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.260]
It's all a diversion.

[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.740]
He isn't amazing how much power this guy has got

[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.780]
that he invented all these crises just to deflect attention

[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.660]
from the important stuff which is the president

[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:51.100]
diddled around a guy who blow jobs from this bimbo.

[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.620]
That's the important stuff we ought to be focusing our attention on.

[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.460]
And thank God there's no partisan politics involved in that.

[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.800]
Trent Lott, you Nazi bastard, you prick.

[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:07.080]
We have an open line and date 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.440]
Here's a mobile and sunrise.

[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:09.780]
Hello.

[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.620]
You know you are a terrible example for the youth of America.

[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.180]
Well you know something the youth of American

[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.080]
can't listen to this show because we're on here in Miami.

[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.500]
You're the same asshole that called yesterday.

[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:19.980]
Give me the same song and a dance.

[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.080]
You got a real boring voice.

[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.540]
You got a personality like a dead frog.

[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:23.520]
Blow it out your ass.

[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.980]
I'm a terrible example for them.

[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:26.620]
Let me say it again.

[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.960]
The youth of America, the ones who are in this market

[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.800]
and showed up at the pizza law last night

[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.480]
who've been listening to me for years and years.

[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.500]
They all grew up to be very normal.

[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.020]
Thank you very healthy, very productive,

[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.060]
very decent people with wives and kids and families.

[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:41.740]
Productive working with the guy houses.

[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:42.680]
How do you like that?

[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.000]
How did they manage to survive that?

[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.460]
If I'm such an evil, no good and why the hell are you listening?

[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.780]
Anyway, you idiotic bastard.

[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.840]
You and calling every day to give us a song and a dance.

[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.380]
If you don't like the show, find something else to do.

[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.040]
Stop being at the moon like a goddamn rabbit dog.

[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.320]
Because just like the moon, I'm not going away.

[00:41:59.420 --> 00:41:59.680]
Okay.

[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.780]
I'll be here today.

[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.480]
I'll be here tomorrow.

[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.720]
I'll be here for a little while on Friday.

[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.820]
And that's the way it is whether you like it or not.

[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.160]
Okay.

[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.360]
So stop baying at the old.

[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:07.820]
Cock-a-roll.

[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:08.140]
Right.

[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.780]
You jackass with your real boring voice.

[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:12.420]
You sound like a guy.

[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.660]
You sound like Sandy Payton and drag.

[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:15.540]
Oh, she's not in drag.

[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.040]
It's for real.

[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.020]
We make something that makes so much goddamn sense

[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.520]
that it terrifies some of these bastards.

[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.700]
So they have to attack me because they can't debate it.

[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.780]
They can't argue it.

[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.280]
Oh, what you're saying makes no sense at all.

[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:27.960]
Of course it does.

[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.380]
It makes all the sense in the world.

[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.400]
And you can't refute it and you can't debate it.

[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.220]
Because you're too stupid to debate it.

[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.560]
Because you're unwilling to think.

[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.180]
You're unwilling to use your brain that separates you from

[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.040]
those stupid insects I was talking about before.

[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.660]
And that cat that's hung out in the goddamn backyard

[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:46.460]
at stupid cat.

[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:47.480]
Come on.

[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:47.880]
Cut it out.

[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.120]
Prevo 80.

[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:52.420]
Hello.

[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.700]
A-N-O.

[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:54.200]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:55.220]
A-N-O.

[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.280]
A, first of all, I want to wish you a happy calamowade.

[00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:58.080]
A what?

[00:42:58.540 --> 00:42:59.720]
A happy calamowade.

[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.380]
This was yesterday and it's still going on as we speak.

[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:02.700]
Oh.

[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:03.880]
That's a big deal.

[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:04.840]
Did you sniff your headdress?

[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.460]
I'll stick with the D&H.

[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.860]
Okay, I don't want any of these bubble monkeys.

[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.260]
You didn't sniff my headdress today.

[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.180]
No, I didn't sniff your anything today, no.

[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.560]
And I've come Liam and Zoni.

[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:13.980]
So he's always.

[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.280]
Okay.

[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.640]
Okay, we have an open line and Broward and two in date.

[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:17.780]
There's another crazy old joke.

[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.340]
Just go over there and dominate the wall.

[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.440]
Okay, just go away on it.

[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.100]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.640]
Probably going to be running off with your accountant

[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:24.060]
pretty soon.

[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:24.960]
Probably David's boyfriend.

[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:29.580]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60 and pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.600]
Here's a lady in Daniel.

[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:31.960]
Hello.

[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:32.880]
Hi.

[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:33.660]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.380]
I want to join your D&H.

[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:37.540]
All right, here's number five.

[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:37.960]
Oh.

[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:38.680]
D&H.

[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.780]
And you know the Christians are afraid they're going to go to hell

[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.340]
if they don't donate or they don't go to church and all

[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:46.720]
they've got them scared to death.

[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.480]
What a, now who in their right mind?

[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.040]
Well, how come they don't stop and think about this?

[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.040]
Who would want to believe in any religion where there's a God

[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:56.340]
that people invented who is so sadistic, so twisted

[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.860]
that if you don't believe a bunch of ridiculous ludicrous things

[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.460]
that nobody's saying would believe in the first place,

[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.440]
that you're going to wind up burning in hell for eternity?

[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.360]
Isn't that a pleasant thought?

[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:06.700]
They scat them.

[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.420]
Anyway, can I tell you a dirty joke on the air?

[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:09.780]
No.

[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:10.340]
Okay.

[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.340]
The other thing, stop your sugar.

[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.460]
The sugar puts on so much weight.

[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:15.020]
It's terrible.

[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.520]
And I call Trent Lock, Trent Mouse.

[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.920]
I got names for them and I'm sending them postcards

[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.720]
like mad.

[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:22.960]
I hope you're looking up with John Ford.

[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.180]
Okay, so we'd our have a great day.

[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:24.520]
Thanks.

[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:25.160]
Okay.

[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.900]
We have an open line in the Broward One Indeed.

[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:29.680]
567-0560,

[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.280]
0560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.420]
SS, baby, doesn't stand for secret service.

[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:36.540]
Not the secret police.

[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.280]
It stands for sugar and starch.

[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.240]
And just like the original,

[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:41.040]
like Hitler's, that says, same thing.

[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:41.500]
They're killers.

[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:42.740]
They'll kill you.

[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:43.900]
Killer carbohydrates.

[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.320]
That's what I should be doing.

[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.240]
I shouldn't be wasting my time sitting here talking

[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.240]
to a bunch of people that have no response to this

[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.880]
because it makes too much sense for them.

[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]
I should be out there peddling the damn AT&T instinct.

[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.960]
Then it might maybe motivate me to stick with it

[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.000]
and lose about 50 pounds

[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.260]
and look like a human being and get my health back again.

[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.580]
That's what I ought to be doing, right?

[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:01.900]
You let your sweet ass.

[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:04.540]
I'm calling up Bob Atkins this afternoon.

[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.260]
I'm going to say, Bob, I want to go out there

[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:07.420]
and spread the guy damn worried.

[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:08.480]
I want to go out there and spread it.

[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.040]
Lonely.

[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:09.760]
Lonely 50.

[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:10.520]
Million dollars.

[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:13.120]
Here's Miami.

[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:13.480]
Hello.

[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:15.480]
You ain't nothing, Bob.

[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:15.780]
Bob.

[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:15.940]

[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:16.040]

[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:16.440]
Okay.

[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:17.620]
Thanks a lot.

[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:18.780]
Y'all come back.

[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.940]
He's got one finger in his right nostril.

[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.020]
The other finger in his rectum.

[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:23.960]
And having a good old time.

[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:24.520]
All right, buddy.

[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:25.280]
We'll see you.

[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.520]
Well, that was Buddy McKay.

[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.440]
No wonder we got no chance.

[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:31.040]
Here's a mobile in Cooper City.

[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:31.340]
Hello.

[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:32.740]
Design, gozo.

[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.440]
Hello, Neil.

[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.380]
What is it?

[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:36.360]
Design, gozo.

[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:37.180]
Means what?

[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:38.880]
How you doing?

[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.260]
What does that mean?

[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:41.180]
What is that?

[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.600]
I don't know.

[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:43.240]
Oh, okay.

[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:44.720]
I think it's similar to

[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.940]
the Smok Step Kazoop.

[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.120]
Is that close?

[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:48.240]
No, I have no idea.

[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.060]
Anyway, Neil.

[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:50.080]
What do we do for you today, sir?

[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:50.940]
Start it in English.

[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.340]
Four and a half years.

[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.480]
We're eating some million dollars.

[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.340]
And central sex.

[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.560]
And I want to beat this guy.

[00:45:58.860 --> 00:45:59.040]
Yeah.

[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.420]
I can't believe it.

[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:01.140]
Okay, well, thank you.

[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.820]
We have an open line in Brown one and date.

[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.380]
56670560 and 0.560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.100]
Thanks for the great Z material, sir.

[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.060]
Here's a mobile in Pembert Pines.

[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:11.340]
Hello.

[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:12.600]
Hey, Neil.

[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:13.040]
How you doing?

[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:13.400]
Okay.

[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.400]
Yeah, you got to give me a fact number

[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.580]
because I got a factless letter to you from this.

[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.520]
Quote unquote this little quaint 47-year-old church

[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.680]
out in Arkansas.

[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:25.500]
I got a letter and it's from Jesus.

[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.580]
Sometime in the next week,

[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.000]
they can't give me an exact date

[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.600]
because I'm sure he's got a busy schedule.

[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.700]
Yeah, I couldn't.

[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.680]
I was appalled by this mailout.

[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.120]
Sometime in the next week,

[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.700]
Jesus will be passing by my house.

[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:38.860]
Oh my god.

[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:39.120]
Wow.

[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:39.900]
Hey, that's the same.

[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:41.380]
We had a call earlier in the show,

[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:42.840]
a lady who was at the pizza law last night

[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.800]
that got home and there was the letter in their box.

[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.100]
It takes the cake.

[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:46.480]
Yeah.

[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.180]
Sometime in the next week,

[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.100]
he's going to be passing by my house.

[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:51.800]
Okay, well, the fax is 305.

[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:53.920]
650.

[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.160]
0198.

[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:57.600]
I'd but listen to this.

[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.240]
Now, I got to take inside this letter,

[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.260]
there's another letter.

[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.340]
Okay, I have to take the letter

[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.880]
and I cannot open it.

[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.360]
And none of any circumstances,

[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.540]
I must not open this letter.

[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.560]
So I check a box,

[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:14.000]
a, b, c or d,

[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.440]
which is $5, $10, $20 or other.

[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.640]
Well, that's the price you take

[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.120]
for opening the envelope, right?

[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.760]
Now, I get it and it says

[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.080]
before you do anything,

[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:24.820]
do not.

[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.140]
I mean, any circumstances

[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.000]
opened this second letter

[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.600]
because I got to sleep on it overnight

[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:33.160]
and I cannot open it until sunset.

[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.520]
Yeah, I'm all wrong.

[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:35.560]
So what do the other letters say?

[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:37.700]
So that's all I got to send them a check

[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.780]
for $5, $10, $20 or other.

[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.600]
And then I get to put in there

[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.580]
what they want me to pray for when I'm on this,

[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.740]
I can understand that.

[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.220]
That's all about the second letter says?

[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:47.820]
Yeah, the first letter.

[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.040]
So if I wanted the second letter say

[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.020]
that you just said you're not supposed to open it.

[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.460]
I opened it up, of course.

[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.720]
And what does it say?

[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.840]
Why are you having so much trouble

[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.180]
communicating here, sir?

[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.100]
It says that I have to,

[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.280]
I have to pray to them what they want me to pray for

[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.220]
and my prayers will be answered.

[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.800]
But how can I mail a letter

[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.160]
to this 47 year old church today

[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.420]
and they're going to have it

[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.700]
and pray for me by sunset tomorrow.

[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.560]
But when you open it up,

[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:16.820]
FedEx overnight mail.

[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.760]
But when you open it up,

[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.700]
that's it to me, $6,500198.

[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.100]
Thank you.

[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:22.920]
We have an open line in front.

[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.720]
Why was it so difficult to squeeze out of him the answer?

[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:26.780]
I think maybe they've got,

[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.020]
they're already working on his mind.

[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.100]
His mind is turning into jello

[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:30.100]
just for opening the envelope.

[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.120]
I think it's a Kami Pinko plot if you ask me.

[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.920]
And they wanted money, huh?

[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:36.320]
Uh-huh.

[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:37.460]
Wow, what a shock.

[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.620]
Like I said, DNH,

[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.240]
do no harm.

[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.220]
Here's a religion that don't cost you a penny.

[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.980]
It doesn't cost a single solitary dime.

[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.320]
And then we'll follow it up.

[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.680]
Have to forget everybody in this religion.

[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.580]
We'll follow it up with like a one that's like optional.

[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.420]
DSG do some good.

[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.340]
DNH in the beginning and then DSG.

[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.220]
If you want, do some good if you can.

[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.260]
If not, okay, we won't hold it against you.

[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.380]
You still won't burn in hell.

[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.560]
Proc 26, the WQM,

[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:07.540]
there's an open line in data.

[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.400]
It's interesting to watch these things flick off of there.

[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.340]
You know, it watches a phone line that's flick off,

[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.440]
which makes you either wonder about the people at Bell South,

[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.240]
where I did them with it,

[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.960]
or just that these people are very impatient.

[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:17.060]
You made that point yesterday,

[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.180]
which I never really thought about before.

[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.680]
I'm the old station,

[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.000]
which I don't want to mention to call it.

[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:23.580]
Because we don't want to go back.

[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.400]
We want to go forward.

[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.860]
But on the old station,

[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.040]
people used to call if they,

[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.220]
you know, they really hung on like a for a long time.

[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.200]
W-I-O-D.

[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.380]
Oh, I hate that state.

[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:33.140]
But here they call and like the new thing is,

[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.200]
I mean, if they do ever call,

[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.140]
if you don't get to like within five seconds,

[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.100]
oh, they're gone, they're busy.

[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:38.880]
But like I said,

[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:40.480]
I don't worry about it because starting day,

[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.520]
I got a whole new leash on life.

[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.560]
And if you think I'm joking,

[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:43.320]
you're dreaming.

[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.740]
I will never ever,

[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.080]
I must be a messicus.

[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.080]
I must be out of my mind.

[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:48.920]
I got to be a fool.

[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:52.320]
But I would ever subject myself to that kind of

[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:55.140]
begging and screaming and carrying on and foolishness.

[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.400]
What's the point?

[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.000]
What is the point?

[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.140]
How many years have been taken off my life

[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.720]
because I got myself sucked into doing that here on this show?

[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:05.400]
What an idiot.

[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:06.240]
What an imbus alarm.

[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.260]
The first one to say it.

[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:07.800]
I'm a schmuck.

[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:10.680]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.060]
Hello.

[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:11.640]
Neil.

[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:12.260]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.540]
I'm a belt stop mobility.

[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:15.420]
You've already cost me five bucks.

[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:16.560]
Yeah.

[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:17.700]
Anyways, I wanted to start.

[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:18.240]
That's a little worth it.

[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:19.400]
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.080]
Yeah, it is because I wanted to tell you

[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.060]
about the psychic powers of your show.

[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:26.280]
I'm a pharmaceutical rep and I just left the company

[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.140]
and I was trying to reach this little witch with a bee

[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:31.000]
that worked at my other company.

[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.220]
And I don't have her page or with me.

[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:33.500]
Yeah.

[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.180]
And she called you five minutes ago.

[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.080]
How do you like that?

[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.180]
So I was just thinking of her.

[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:39.780]
So if you're still listening,

[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:41.180]
Lisa, page me, okay?

[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:42.000]
I'm the late boss.

[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:42.620]
See, there you go.

[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:43.420]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:44.460]
It's better than Schrold Griffin.

[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.000]
It's like the psychic friends that work.

[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.000]
I'm not going to use a page or any more.

[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.700]
I'm just going to call everybody through your show.

[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.020]
All right.

[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:50.720]
All right, buddy.

[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.000]
See ya.

[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:51.240]
Bye.

[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.220]
Well, I'm gagging this.

[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.220]
Slow down when that's a girl.

[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:53.960]
Okay, it's really good.

[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.640]
But uh, uh, too late.

[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.680]
Well, I think I got a real good greenie coming up, baby.

[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.520]
We have an open line in date, five, six, seven,

[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.380]
oh, five, 60 and pound five, 60 on the 18 T wireless line.

[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:08.380]
No calls about this Peter War rel incident

[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:09.700]
about Brian Murray, Lucienet.

[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.980]
I'm just, I just can't get over that.

[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:13.620]
That comment.

[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.440]
Darcy Tucker stuck an index finger in his mouth

[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.160]
repeatedly and gesturing to a rail.

[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.080]
And Murray thought it was making fun of where

[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.540]
all is a banana eating ape.

[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.800]
What kind of a comment is that?

[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.920]
I mean, if a guy goes like,

[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.540]
fuck, fuck, fuck, man, chicken, even little kids know that.

[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.200]
It's got nothing to do with a racial slur.

[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.180]
I think BM, I think he's solutionating.

[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.900]
I think his brother, Terry, needs to send him off to Kampselmer.

[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.220]
Send him up to a Caloet for a few months during the season.

[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:41.760]
Okay, Terry.

[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:43.080]
Terry's doing a stellar job.

[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:43.740]
He's a good guy.

[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.860]
He's got him a really plan.

[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:45.760]
They were great last night.

[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.400]
They might be better than we thought.

[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:50.960]
But BM, Shia, we'll be Shia.

[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.100]
Here's Miami.

[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:53.460]
Hello.

[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:54.700]
Neo.

[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:55.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:59.480]
My FedEx driving circumcised first time calling Julio.

[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:01.360]
Great.

[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:05.040]
They ought to pay triple for what you make.

[00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.640]
You have to deal with these idiots that call you every day.

[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:07.980]
Yeah.

[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.420]
I'm two more days for the hot these season.

[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:14.160]
I can't hardly wait even though we got our young prospects

[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.060]
that are going to lead us into the playoffs.

[00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:17.340]
Well, they look pretty good last night.

[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.000]
I got to tell you this kid, Mark Parrish,

[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.520]
he's got to lead the team with six goals.

[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:21.900]
The preseason, he looks outstanding.

[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:23.820]
And this Kavasha kids playing good.

[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:24.880]
And that's his he's SpaceX.

[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.940]
That kid's not too bad.

[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.180]
And, uh, he'll be there Friday night.

[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:28.440]
I can't wait.

[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.220]
There's one other one.

[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.160]
It's that Ratchard kid.

[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.080]
He looks pretty good too.

[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.280]
Even though they might have to send him down.

[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:32.660]
Yeah, we're against Kamp from.

[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:33.940]
They use the free agent, right?

[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:34.600]
Ratchard.

[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.440]
They use the free agent.

[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:35.740]
Yeah.

[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:37.620]
They thought about on a bus and a dumpster.

[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.100]
Where do you think the devil's are going to be at this year?

[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:42.340]
I haven't seen any other teams play.

[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:44.340]
So why don't start making predictions to the last season's turn.

[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.100]
So I haven't, you know, exhibition games mean nothing.

[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:46.940]
All right.

[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.600]
I want to ask for two things.

[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.960]
Just suck around for a no BM button if you have any left.

[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:52.320]
No.

[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:53.040]
No.

[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:58.020]
And shameless request, uh, the president and Elmer Fudd on your next break.

[00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:58.380]
OK.

[00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.120]
All right.

[00:52:59.240 --> 00:52:59.500]
Thank you.

[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.580]
Is that in here, by the way?

[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:02.140]
What is that called?

[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:03.840]
Huh?

[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.460]
You know the one I mean to settle like comedy thing

[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:06.780]
from a Clinton and the Elmer Fudd?

[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:07.760]
What does that call, George?

[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:08.660]
I know it's not in there.

[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:09.520]
It's not in there.

[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:10.340]
Like I said, forget it.

[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:10.920]
OK.

[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.120]
We got two open lines in a day.

[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.260]
Well, now that we got all that hard drive time in here,

[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:15.980]
now we can start getting all this other stuff in here.

[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:16.740]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:20.840]
That we weren't able to do because, uh, yeah, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5,

[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:23.500]
60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.920]
Here's a mobile and crawl springs.

[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:26.320]
Hello?

[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:27.460]
Reverend Ningo.

[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:29.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:31.000]
Speak to me.

[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:31.980]
Can I have a number?

[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:33.040]
Number three?

[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:34.360]
Go ahead.

[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.120]
All right.

[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.820]
Ningo, I want to thank you for yesterday.

[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:37.680]
It was fantastic.

[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:38.360]
We have the numbers.

[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:39.520]
I'm sure you got the wrong show.

[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:40.000]
OK.

[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.160]
I want to say what I mean for your religion.

[00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:42.440]
Yeah.

[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.140]
No numbers.

[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.880]
And I want to thank you for the show

[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:47.500]
that your parents last night.

[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.380]
It was just great.

[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:48.760]
Yeah.

[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:53.260]
And Blatha, CDs, and this number two was great.

[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:53.960]
It's different.

[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.180]
I really liked it.

[00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:55.900]
They're all great.

[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:56.620]
They're both great.

[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:57.720]
Yeah, they're both great.

[00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:58.820]
This number one was great.

[00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.900]
It was everything I expected.

[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:01.180]
Yeah, number two is outrageous.

[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:01.780]
That's right.

[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:03.780]
But this number two has some surprises on it.

[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:04.600]
And I really liked it.

[00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:05.000]
Excellent.

[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:07.160]
And people should buy both of them as a set.

[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:09.780]
And I wanted to say something about the old goals

[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:10.900]
that he's not disgusting.

[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:11.820]
He's very interested.

[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.480]
And I appreciated the fact he was there.

[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.100]
And he actually gave me a signed copy

[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:19.020]
of his illustrated style report.

[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:19.560]
Yeah.

[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.440]
And that's why you liked him.

[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:22.200]
Because he gave you something.

[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.740]
The other the bitch that called me for.

[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:24.680]
You didn't get anything from him.

[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:25.420]
So you don't like him.

[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.480]
Well, and also I think the Yankees

[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.760]
are going to do to everybody else

[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.440]
what the braves did to the cops.

[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:30.740]
OK.

[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:31.440]
Good luck to you, sir.

[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:32.220]
OK.

[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.600]
We have an open line of Brad, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.860]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:38.100]
No sports talk today.

[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:38.380]
OK.

[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:39.460]
Only a little hockey talk.

[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:40.520]
And it's not really about hockey.

[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:42.160]
It's about the racial problems

[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.700]
that Brian Maria's hallucinating about.

[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.240]
Bok, bok, bok.

[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:45.860]
Oh my god.

[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:47.200]
Where is that thing, by the way?

[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:49.360]
See, it's very hard.

[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.960]
It's hard to hit the button when you got your,

[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.940]
you have to do with one arm like that.

[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:54.440]
Like that.

[00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.580]
One more.

[00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:57.900]
One more.

[00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:58.320]
OK.

[00:54:58.900 --> 00:54:59.520]
There you go.

[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:02.920]
Here's a mobile in Pembert Pines.

[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:03.200]
Hello.

[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:04.760]
And here I go.

[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:05.360]
OK, sir.

[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.760]
I stop by the hooters there.

[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.980]
And they give you a birthday in Pines.

[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.880]
Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention they gave all the stuff away

[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.400]
in their long run.

[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.120]
They were mobdys.

[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.880]
They just wanted to say thank a male,

[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:14.940]
a listener, and a caller.

[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:15.540]
Right.

[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:16.880]
Just wanted to say thank.

[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:19.460]
And a lot of Tommiki Street is a dish bag.

[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:19.900]
All right.

[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:21.260]
So yeah, there you go.

[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:22.800]
Yeah, they, you know, Sam, I guess,

[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:23.620]
expected to be people.

[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:24.680]
They're waiting for them.

[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.760]
They showed up once you guys got there, OK?

[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.600]
Because they had free stuff.

[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:30.420]
And like 50 billion people showed up.

[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:31.460]
The free stuff is gone.

[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:32.860]
And they were gone like 10 after 12.

[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:35.620]
Boy, am I gagging on it?

[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:37.640]
I think somebody has doctored my stogie.

[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:38.600]
Is what I think.

[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:41.580]
Either better somebody put it in a recomb plate.

[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:42.000]
Reckomb.

[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:42.660]
Oh, geez.

[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:44.060]
Yeah.

[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:44.660]
See?

[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:48.060]
I told you, first, Mark Belanjay and Cal Ripken

[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:49.240]
seniors got that problem.

[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:50.380]
Are you kids out there?

[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.360]
No smoking, OK?

[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:51.900]
I'll kill you.

[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.700]
All you young people, it's a filthy, disgusting,

[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:56.980]
habitant discolors your teeth that gives you a bad breath.

[00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:58.840]
It'll grow you a 200 size of a guy

[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:00.580]
that in grapefruit, maybe even a watermelon.

[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.120]
Oh, see, I shouldn't have said watermelon.

[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:04.420]
Brian Maria would be calling in.

[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.980]
How about if I said watermelon and went like that

[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:08.400]
as the same?

[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:08.960]
Oh, geez.

[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.420]
I can't believe he said that.

[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:15.700]
Let me look at it one more time.

[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.060]
He thought he was making fun of who

[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.780]
well as a banana eating ape.

[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.980]
Because he went, I know.

[00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:27.540]

[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:31.220]
Brian, you need some a sure your shop, OK?

[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.560]
You need some a sure your therapy.

[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.220]
Hey, you want to put something good in your mouth?

[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.960]
And no matter you, here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:38.280]
Hello?

[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:39.460]
Neil.

[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:40.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:41.260]
Greetings. How are you?

[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:41.660]
Great.

[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:42.880]
Never made a matter, sir.

[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:44.080]
Greatest day of my life.

[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.400]
You may needle down and kiss the rings

[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:49.500]
to be an honorary member of DNH.

[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:50.360]
Neil, God.

[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:52.960]
No, it's funny though.

[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.900]
You say, do not harm, but I guarantee you're

[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.040]
going to have somebody's religious,

[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.100]
fanatic, calling them saying, do not harm.

[00:56:58.220 --> 00:56:59.140]
What do you think you're doing?

[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.220]
By doing all your hatred on the air.

[00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:02.680]
It's purely hatred about what?

[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:03.740]
hatred of what?

[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:05.340]
I'm not the heater.

[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:06.500]
They're the ones that have hate.

[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:07.760]
Yeah, well, that's there.

[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:10.700]
You know something I talked about this two hours ago,

[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:11.880]
and here it is almost one o'clock.

[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.400]
I still have an at one call from these good,

[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:16.060]
brainwashed believers out there.

[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:18.260]
Other than the ones who want to attack me,

[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.880]
having at one call tell me why this is such a bad idea.

[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.320]
Why this doesn't make any sense?

[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:23.900]
They're blowing some out here, Neil.

[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:24.940]
You keep doing what you're doing.

[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:25.340]
OK.

[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:26.000]
Arthur.

[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:26.560]
See you.

[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:29.340]
Don't let me eat too much of this.

[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:30.100]
I'm just having a little bite.

[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:31.740]
I want my mother to start hypervatalating,

[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:32.860]
because I'm going there for lunch today.

[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:33.800]
OK, that's enough.

[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:34.680]
No, it's not.

[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:36.180]
Ashtole, mind your own business.

[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.500]
Don't be a Yenta.

[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.860]
Remember, Sonny Hirsch once said,

[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:40.440]
don't be a Yenta.

[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.240]
Look what happened to him.

[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.120]
We have two open lines in Broward, five six, seven,

[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.060]
oh five, 60, pound five, 60.

[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:49.060]
I am, see, I'm not going to beg for calls,

[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.080]
but I'm begging and pleading for somebody to call

[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.620]
to dispute the truth of DNA.

[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.440]
I mean, we know that DNA is indisputable.

[00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:58.620]
OJ taught us that.

[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.220]
Monica taught us that.

[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.820]
And the same is true, no matter what letter is on the end,

[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:05.440]
DNH, do no harm.

[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.000]
Why do we need these religious institutions?

[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:10.880]
Why do you need to have someplace to go on these stupid holidays?

[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:13.780]
Why do you got to go there and put a stupid schmata on your head?

[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:17.360]
Why do you go there and stick a dumb wafer in your post?

[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.780]
Why do you got to go there and confess your sins

[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:21.160]
that somebody else called sins,

[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:22.360]
because you had a good time, maybe,

[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:25.260]
to some stupid pansy in a dress

[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:27.900]
that's sitting on the other side of a confessional booth,

[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.180]
getting off on it, okay?

[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.840]
They think the priest has got a head cold over there

[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:36.100]
to hear a lot of heavy breathing in the puke on the other side.

[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:37.340]
I got news for it, baby.

[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:38.560]
He's yanking it.

[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:42.700]
And if the church is really so sure to cash,

[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.500]
all I got to start doing is putting quarters

[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.820]
to put the slots in the arrow on the confessional booth.

[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:47.300]
That's right.

[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.140]
Let them pay for it.

[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:52.740]
Two open lines in Broward, five, six, seven, oh five,

[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.200]
60, pound five, 60 on the AT&T wireless.

[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.500]
You think we have, by two o'clock,

[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.980]
we'll have one person here called today

[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:00.920]
and have a legitimate discussion about this who disagrees.

[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.540]
Will there be one who's got the courage

[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.200]
in their convictions?

[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:03.560]
No.

[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:05.160]
You bet your suite as there won't.

[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.700]
Because they know I can talk circles around them

[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:09.900]
and four seconds or less,

[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:11.100]
because they don't make any sense.

[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:13.520]
Oh, you better watch out,

[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:14.420]
because you're gonna burn it.

[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:15.180]
Oh, yeah.

[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:16.680]
Focus, focus.

[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:17.560]
That's the focus.

[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:20.600]
Here's Lauder Hill. Hello.

[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:21.900]
Hello.

[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:22.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.300]
Yeah, I want to know where you're coming from,

[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:27.580]
what you're doing, and what are you trying to prove?

[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:28.140]
About what?

[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:28.980]
Watch all I'm asking.

[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:29.480]
About what?

[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:31.900]
What you're talking about, like there is no God.

[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:32.520]
How do you know?

[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:34.320]
I beg your pardon?

[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:35.980]
How do you know there is no God?

[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:37.660]
I'm not the one who suggested that there was.

[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:38.960]
See, the burden of proof is on it.

[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:40.760]
Sir, do you want to answer your question?

[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:42.120]
Yeah, okay.

[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.300]
And if you believe that there's a God,

[00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:44.940]
if somebody tells me there's a God

[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:46.440]
then the burden of proof is on you.

[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:47.640]
It's not a negative burden.

[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.180]
I don't have to prove that there isn't one.

[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:50.340]
You have to prove that there is one.

[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.680]
Okay, what I don't want to say is

[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:52.780]
if you let me for one second.

[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.300]
I'm listening.

[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:56.460]
Okay, when we are brought up, whatever religion we are,

[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:58.360]
whatever nationality do.

[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.560]
I'm trying to make people think instead of being brainwashed.

[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:03.300]
In other words, if you happen to be lucky enough

[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.220]
to be born into the family that's of the right religion

[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:06.120]
then you're going to be saved.

[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:07.000]
Is that what you're suggesting?

[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.940]
No, no, no, I believe in every religion.

[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:11.880]
I believe in everybody has their religion.

[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:15.320]
I am not against anybody religion.

[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:15.740]
Yeah.

[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.860]
The one I'm trying to get.

[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.740]
What about in Northern Ireland, sir?

[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.020]
Do you think those people ought to be encouraged

[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.040]
to keep coming each other?

[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:21.820]
They're animals.

[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.120]
They're animals.

[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.140]
And what about in the Middle East?

[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.240]
You're going to know what to do.

[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.800]
And what about in Indian Pakistan?

[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:29.700]
You're going to know what to do?

[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.200]
And what about the religious right-wingness

[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.080]
country that's been debiting abortion clinics?

[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.380]
God, here you make no sense.

[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.000]
You're just a babbling old fool, okay?

[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.800]
I want to talk to somebody who's got some substance.

[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.080]
Not just talk littering generalities and spout

[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.840]
and spew guys too old to have a goddamn brain of his own.

[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.120]
I believe in all religions.

[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:46.520]
Great.

[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.720]
Then you're crazier than any of the rest of these bastards, okay?

[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:50.960]
One is bad enough.

[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.700]
But all of you must be crazier than a bedbug.

[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:55.420]
Call a goddamn exterminator, okay?

[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:56.600]
We got bedbugs in the phone.

[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:56.980]
Oh!

[01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.240]
Two open lines in Broward.

[01:00:59.340 --> 01:00:59.700]
Five, six.

[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:00.360]
See, that's what I mean.

[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:03.440]
I sat here patiently waiting for an intelligent conversation.

[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.760]
All their animals anyway.

[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:06.480]
Yeah, they're animals.

[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.200]
They're not animals.

[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:08.640]
They're people just like everybody else,

[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.960]
but they've been brainwashed and they're filled with hate.

[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:15.160]
And they hate each other because they can't coerce

[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.160]
the other ones to believe the same fairy tales.

[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.780]
And you know something, they're all Christians.

[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.820]
That's the most bizarre part of the whole deal.

[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:24.720]
The Protestants and the Catholics over there

[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.120]
to hate each other like poison, that's not the only place.

[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.020]
Is it the Lutherans?

[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.100]
Is it the Methodist?

[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.060]
Is it which sect are we talking about?

[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.140]
Who's which ones got the Tony, baby?

[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.480]
That's the question of the day.

[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.000]
Which ones got the Tony?

[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.660]
Who's got the real answer?

[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.820]
And I'll tell you right now, who's got the real answer?

[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.680]
Nobody's got the real answer.

[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.660]
Nobody like Harvey Paxes on a goddamn Belmont Racing Show.

[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:51.840]
Nobody picks.

[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:52.940]
And you do?

[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.220]
Because I got more people on my side

[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.020]
and my people are reproducing like rabbits.

[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:00.180]
DNH, do no harm.

[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:02.400]
It makes absolutely all a sense in the world.

[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.620]
Simple, cost you no money.

[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.100]
Nope, empty promises of bullcrap.

[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.280]
No devil with a pitchfork and a tail

[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.400]
and all these and the horns and angels

[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.340]
with their little harps.

[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.660]
Oh, God, you're good.

[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:16.860]
Yeah, for eternity.

[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.140]
I'd rather be burned out in the lake of fire, okay?

[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.080]
Than to be the rest of my...

[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:22.840]
Oh, God, you're good.

[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.160]
And I just keep saying that I like it.

[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.100]
Oh, God, you're good.

[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.740]
That's what they have to look forward to these people.

[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.380]
Their souls are going to be saved.

[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.200]
I got news for you, okay?

[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:35.300]
I'm looking at my souls.

[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:36.460]
They're pretty goddamn worn out.

[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:37.780]
Okay, must be all I'm walking in Europe.

[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.840]
Gotta go out and get a new goddamn pair of shoes

[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.720]
because I can't even save the souls on my shoes

[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.400]
as much as the soul.

[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:45.940]
Oh, man, who's got a soul.

[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:49.680]
How do you function without a brain and a heart?

[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.080]
Did anybody ever ask that question?

[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:55.680]
Anybody ever see anybody make a comeback?

[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:55.980]
No.

[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:56.820]
I haven't seen it.

[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.300]
Once they stick your ass in the ground,

[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:00.500]
that's where you stay, baby.

[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:01.540]
And it may not be...

[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:03.500]
And what kind of a God will create that anyway?

[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:06.780]
I mean, if we understand that nature,

[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.260]
that all things are part of nature,

[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.380]
and every species has a lifespan,

[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:11.780]
then we can understand that.

[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:12.440]
We may not like it.

[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.080]
It might like to be around for two, three hundred years,

[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.560]
or instead of like 70 or 80 or 90, whatever it's going to be.

[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:18.920]
But if that's the plan of nature,

[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.040]
if that's the way nature works,

[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:21.340]
we can understand that.

[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.940]
There's a logic to that.

[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.280]
But if there was some kind of a God,

[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.800]
who invoked created man,

[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.580]
and only gave him a very short lifespan,

[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.000]
what kind of a sadistic, no good God is that?

[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.480]
We were made to live forever.

[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.640]
Only sin, kill.

[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:35.600]
Yeah, only sin.

[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.560]
Only this devil again, okay?

[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:40.240]
And since God knew up front right in the beginning

[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.880]
because of the fact that he's...

[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.060]
he's omniscient, and I...

[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.060]
because he knows everything.

[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:46.620]
He knew ahead of time

[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.820]
when he kept tempting these people,

[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:48.980]
what the choice would be.

[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:50.260]
And then the...

[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.900]
the simpletons that wrote these bubble mice,

[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.280]
he's, oh, well, he got pissed off.

[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.520]
Well, how could he get pissed off?

[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.900]
And he knew what was going to happen anyway.

[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:00.220]
You have to be an imbecile to believe this.

[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:03.180]
You have to be mentally deficient to believe this crap.

[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:07.880]
And then he's going to punish you

[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.720]
and make you burn in hell,

[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.200]
like all those people that he killed,

[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.280]
when Noah, when that old slipper Noah,

[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.160]
got out there and built the ark.

[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:13.700]
And if...

[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.260]
let me ask you this,

[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.100]
if God created the whole universe and the sun

[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:18.820]
and the stars and the moon and the cockamount,

[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.700]
how come Noah, this poor old slipper,

[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.400]
had to build the ark?

[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.260]
Why didn't God just go?

[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.520]
But I'm being...

[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:25.640]
Huh?

[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:26.880]
Oh, there's an ark.

[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:27.340]
Look at that.

[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.340]
Lookie here.

[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:29.960]
Look at that thing.

[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.900]
And I guarantee you God would have made a better ark

[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:33.100]
than that poor old slipper Noah.

[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:35.240]
One that could have fat the dinosaurs on.

[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:37.460]
And probably had a hell of a lot better turlits on there too,

[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.460]
for all those damn dinosaurs, that's right.

[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:42.760]
Man, oh man.

[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.180]
Can you...

[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:43.840]
Like I said before,

[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:46.440]
how'd you like to have had the turlits concession on that ark?

[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:47.640]
Woo!

[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.000]
Talk about heavy duties.

[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.220]
Here's a mobile-informed Myers, hello.

[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.960]
Hey, uh, I just wanted to tell you,

[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.680]
the reason you're not going to get anybody coming

[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:57.320]
to talk to you,

[01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.060]
you're like little Tarathie on the Wizard of Oz.

[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.000]
You're throwing water.

[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.120]
These witches don't want to come anywhere near you.

[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:03.600]
Oh, is that it?

[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:04.540]
Yeah, it's it.

[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:04.960]
Yeah.

[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:06.880]
You don't think so?

[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:08.280]
Yeah, I get it.

[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.620]
But the thing makes too much, you're what you're saying,

[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:10.480]
makes too much that.

[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:11.040]
Yeah, you're right.

[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.060]
That's the problem.

[01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:12.880]
They can't deal with it.

[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:13.700]
They can't cope with it.

[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:14.340]
It's too simple.

[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:16.480]
They want to make it complicated and it's very easy.

[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:18.840]
Yeah, you know, you actually have lots of listeners

[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:19.860]
over here in Fort Myers.

[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:20.360]
I know that.

[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:20.960]
The problem is,

[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:23.660]
you don't have any kind of cold-free lines

[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:24.700]
with children, everybody.

[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:25.940]
You get on here.

[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:27.840]
Yeah, well listen, it's the beesleaves, the beesleaves.

[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:28.060]
Yeah. Yeah.

[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.580]
They're too cheap to put a toll-free line in.

[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:29.920]
You kidding?

[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:30.300]
Yeah.

[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:31.760]
Okay, just thought about it.

[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.480]
Let you know we're listening.

[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:33.380]
God bless you, sir.

[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:34.200]
Okay, bye.

[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:35.100]
Like I said.

[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:36.060]
Damn God.

[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:36.520]
Bless you.

[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.960]
We got a member over Fort Myers.

[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.300]
P and H. You know something?

[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:41.320]
This is going to scare all those far-bison out there.

[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.240]
I'm making more converts on one show today,

[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.280]
and this is only the beginning.

[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:46.600]
And you want to know why?

[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.120]
Because it makes sense, number one, and number two, it's free.

[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.900]
It doesn't cost your penny to join this outfit.

[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:53.960]
Do no harm.

[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.240]
That's all.

[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.000]
Like they say, it's basketball.

[01:05:59.160 --> 01:05:59.960]
No harm, no foul.

[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.360]
That's the only religion that makes sense.

[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.120]
You teach that to kids.

[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:06.020]
Oh, yeah, okay.

[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.080]
That sounds reasonable.

[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:10.980]
Unlike those weird stories that they were trying to teach us before.

[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.340]
And about hating everybody who doesn't believe the same crap that we do.

[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.880]
We don't hate anybody.

[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:18.840]
We just get along.

[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:19.560]
We just survive.

[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.700]
And if you want to associate with somebody you do, if you don't, you associate with somebody else,

[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:23.840]
that's all do no harm.

[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:30.360]
Like I said, I should be at the United Nations right now broadcasting intercontinental.

[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:35.640]
I should be all over the goddamn world on a satellite preaching the absolute goddamn.

[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.080]
Oh, God.

[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:36.600]
That's right.

[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:42.280]
The word of what's his name and put an end to all this tax-free bullcraft,

[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:44.320]
the biggest scam in the history of the human race.

[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:51.540]
And I feel so sorry for people who are so brainwashed that they can't use one little,

[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:54.720]
that they have taken the ability to think they've had to take it away.

[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.820]
It's been, it's that's a sin.

[01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:59.020]
If there's such a thing as a sin, I've said this before, that's a sin.

[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.440]
When you steal somebody's ability to use their brain,

[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:08.840]
the one thing that separates us from the cockroaches and all those other crawling scabby creatures,

[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:10.500]
the human brain,

[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.240]
and they want to take that away from you as early as possible,

[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:17.040]
because once you're old enough to start thinking about, hey, this is a bunch of crap,

[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:20.760]
this is like Santa Claus in the tooth for once you're old enough to start reasoning like that,

[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:21.820]
they're never going to get you.

[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.440]
You're a lost cause.

[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.320]
So just like Hitler with his not-so-youth,

[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:30.380]
they have to brainwash you from the earliest moments with bullcrab.

[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.460]
For a minute, I'm still waiting here, it is one o'clock coming up after the break.

[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.300]
One o'clock, the one to two hour coming up, have them,

[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.280]
and we still had anybody other than that, a babbling, dottering old fool,

[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.140]
who was talking double talk, and we had one?

[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:42.460]
No.

[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.320]
Not one.

[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:49.480]
And like the guy said, just like Dorothy, just call me Dorothy Rogers, okay?

[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:54.940]
Pathetic.

[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.780]
Hey, if you're looking for me, knew that this Saturday,

[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.760]
QAM's got the college game of the year, right here.

[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:04.540]
It's UM against Florida State, live from the Orange East.

[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:04.740]
That's right.

[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:09.760]
That's about 3.30 right here on sports radio, 5.60, QAM.

[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:13.080]
And when those testicles they have come knocking on my door,

[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.060]
I grabbed my red pajamas and my pink for you.

[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.680]
All right, great.

[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:17.720]
All right, Neil.

[01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:18.940]
Thanks for the great tale.

[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:19.840]
See ya. See ya.

[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:20.080]
Okay.

[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:25.040]
We have an open line in the Dave County, 5.60, 7.05, 60,

[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.300]
and POM 5.60 on a mobile one line.

[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:28.540]
Oh, you heard the good news.

[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:30.420]
Yeah, the good news is you're out of here, okay?

[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.180]
That's the good news.

[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.160]
The good news that the door is slamming in your face,

[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.820]
and I'm going back to watching my day in soap opera, whatever.

[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:38.700]
Boy, oh boy.

[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.540]
By the way, speaking of soap opera, is it matter?

[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:43.360]
Has anybody ever seen so much terraced at the same time as guiding light?

[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:44.220]
Wow.

[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:48.800]
We got Diana who just won't die because she didn't take quite enough blood pressure pills.

[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.680]
We got Ben who just won't die because he's a miserable SOB.

[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.500]
We got Blake who's all of a sudden walking like a miracle now,

[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:57.220]
and Ross is in the middle of it, and wow.

[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.480]
You think you got problems turning on guiding light,

[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.780]
and it really cracks me up.

[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:04.180]
These guys did say, oh, what kind of a guy watches a soap opera?

[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.180]
And then I was listening to Henka a couple of weeks ago.

[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:09.080]
And he was doing this thing, or no, it was managed, filling in.

[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.200]
Asked about guys not watching Monday night football,

[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:15.060]
and you'd be amazed at how many guys were calling in saying

[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:18.260]
they're watching Melrose Place on Monday night.

[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.160]
Now, is Melrose Place a soap opera?

[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:22.240]
Last time I checked.

[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.400]
Do people watch it because there's a lot of hot flesh on there?

[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.560]
Right, just like we watch soap operas the daytime.

[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:30.560]
Hey, Billy, just keep your mouth shut, Billy.

[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.440]
Billy is looking real good on guiding light.

[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:37.260]
If he just doesn't talk, you know, he's got that little...

[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.660]
Here's a mobile and four-lotter nail. Hello.

[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:41.160]
How you doing, Neil?

[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:41.680]
Okay, sir.

[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.760]
I've been thinking about your topic today.

[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.560]
Yes, and it made me start to think that, you know,

[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.380]
if you start thinking back during the Renaissance period

[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.780]
and all during medieval times,

[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.540]
it was the best way to keep the sheep in line.

[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.140]
Yes, scare them.

[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:58.660]
If you scare them by saying, hey, if you don't do this,

[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.300]
you're going to very bad life.

[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.140]
You're not going to lose them worth of damn.

[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:04.500]
That's what that old, Madeleine O'Herz said before she ran off

[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:04.980]
with all the money.

[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:06.840]
Religion without a hell isn't worth a damn.

[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:07.920]
Nobody's going to be into it.

[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:09.760]
That's life after death and heaven and hell.

[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.640]
That's what it's all about.

[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:11.940]
That is so true.

[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:12.500]
You know what?

[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:13.220]
I'm a hulio.

[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.000]
I was that type of a Catholic.

[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:15.920]
But you know what?

[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:21.100]
The first day of what I saw is just the Bible is a good book of fiction.

[01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:24.320]
No, it's not even a good book of fiction.

[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:27.480]
It's a twisted and distorted and warped and full of hate inside courses

[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:30.200]
and it makes no sense whatsoever and contradictions.

[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:34.400]
It tells a good story and it doesn't tell a horrible story.

[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.540]
Well, the thing is, you have to take the good things out of it.

[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:39.560]
You have to take the morality parts out of it.

[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:40.860]
You have to take the good things out of it.

[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.840]
The parts that you say, hey, you shouldn't kill people, it's not good.

[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:47.860]
But if your children are disobedient, they shall surely be stoned in death.

[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:51.940]
You can't be selectively pious.

[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.040]
You can't just pick and choose what makes sense

[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.760]
and out of a book that makes no sense in its totality.

[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.580]
You can't do that.

[01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.460]
Isn't that what you're doing?

[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.260]
You're choosing what makes sense.

[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.240]
No, I'm not.

[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:03.880]
That's not what I'm doing at all.

[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:04.920]
I didn't get it out of a book.

[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.420]
I got it from common sense.

[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:09.840]
I didn't need somebody to write me a book saying you don't harm other people.

[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:10.940]
You don't steal their property.

[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:11.740]
You don't hurt people.

[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.180]
That doesn't require reading a book.

[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.600]
I never said I was my life-fizer book.

[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.820]
But what I'm saying is you can do a pickout.

[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.600]
Just like you do on any other book

[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:24.020]
that you can pick up that tells a good story that teaches morality.

[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.080]
I mean, I can leave a bunch of them out there.

[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.980]
It teaches morality about how all these people had slaves

[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.440]
and they were begetting and begetting this one and that one and everything.

[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:34.460]
All the sottomy and the incest that was going on.

[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:38.860]
You're nailing down the really, you know, medieval point.

[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.080]
The stuff that's really...

[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:40.940]
The medieval points.

[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:42.860]
It's going to take a little medieval, anything.

[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.720]
If I got the book right back here, I'll get the damn book out.

[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.660]
If you want me to, it's got nothing to do with medieval or anything.

[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:48.800]
It's right in the...

[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.900]
Go read it, pal. Have a great day.

[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.340]
See, he's making a little bit of progress.

[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.700]
Okay, he's taking like one about a half a baby step.

[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.220]
But he can't take the rest of the step.

[01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.260]
Show the book away.

[01:11:58.460 --> 01:11:59.540]
Okay, go burn it somewhere.

[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:00.420]
Go have a good time.

[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.060]
All these right wingers are in the book burning.

[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:03.180]
There's one that ought to be burned.

[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.460]
Because it's full of sickness and twisted crap.

[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:07.640]
Oh, disobedient children.

[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:08.960]
She'll surely be stoned to death.

[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.020]
Well, that sounds great.

[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.880]
And that's coming right from God himself.

[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.500]
That loving God who loves us.

[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.460]
But boy, he gets pissed off.

[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:17.880]
And every time he gets pissed off,

[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.860]
his wrath shall wax hot because...

[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:22.620]
Pist off gets me fired up when I hear someone say that.

[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:23.380]
That's right. That's right there.

[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.260]
At the beginning of Genesis, that's what God says.

[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.200]
And that's why his wrath is waxing hot.

[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:31.920]
Some days it's so hot even listens to waxing.

[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:32.460]
He's the one.

[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:36.300]
Till he heard Rene Rion there doing that Uga Buga.

[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:37.720]
QA air.

[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.840]
You get a lot of beef.

[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:42.520]
Farts.

[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.060]
The O' Rogers on the sports hall radio.

[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:46.760]
WQA.

[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.620]
Two at two o'clock.

[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.000]
We got the boogster at six.

[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.840]
Then we got the pop raisin Atlanta 745 tonight.

[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.880]
We're getting to the big stuff.

[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:56.800]
Here's Hollywood. Hello.

[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:57.940]
Uncle Neil.

[01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:59.240]
Yes, sir. How you doing, sir?

[01:12:59.360 --> 01:12:59.780]
Can you start me?

[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:01.240]
Can you start me up for any DNA?

[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:03.540]
Okay, your number 5,000.

[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.100]
This thing is growing like topsy, man.

[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:05.940]
All right, awesome.

[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:06.780]
Hey, sir.

[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.440]
I'm trying to change the subject and religion.

[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:10.160]
Something else that affects all of us.

[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.020]
About 25 minutes ago on CNBC.

[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:12.540]
Yes.

[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:18.220]
General Reno was on there talking about how the department justice has just filed an antitrust

[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:20.860]
lawsuit against Mastercard and Visa.

[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.220]
She was saying something or other about it because they're both owned by the same company.

[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.900]
Or something or other about their own both owned by the same banks or something.

[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.440]
But it really it affects all of them.

[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.360]
So what does that mean?

[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.100]
Well, just a part of the big family.

[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.200]
Just the antitrust, the monopoly.

[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:37.740]
So we're going to get some money back?

[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:39.760]
I don't know. She went gibber jabber.

[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:40.640]
Well, I'm interested of us.

[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:41.600]
Yeah. Yeah, right.

[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:42.700]
She was gibber jabbering.

[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:44.460]
She does that very well. She gibber jabbered a lot.

[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:46.320]
Well, like I said, I didn't understand all of it.

[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.940]
I didn't get on the all of the technical stuff or whatever.

[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.020]
But I caught the gist of it.

[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:51.380]
Yeah.

[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:54.200]
But anyway, I have a shameless request.

[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:54.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:56.940]
Okay, next break. Can you play Casey Kasem?

[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:57.820]
Which one?

[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.560]
The one that he's where he's cursing.

[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.000]
Okay.

[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.180]
All right. Also, Neil.

[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:03.020]
Yes?

[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.520]
Try Gilbert's world and then Jerry.

[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:07.020]
What is it?

[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.340]
It's called Gilbert's world.

[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:08.820]
Oh, Gilbert.

[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:10.040]
I think you said Gilbert's world.

[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.740]
I was like, okay, thanks a lot, pal.

[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.220]
Get out of here.

[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:13.820]
I thought he said Gilbert.

[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.460]
And then it's not like he said Gilbert's world.

[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:16.560]
I passed on that.

[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.620]
My favorite moment of our thing at the last Saturday

[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:25.520]
when we were at borders over by the gallery was when Gilbert,

[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:28.200]
right after he's saying the national anthem.

[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:29.240]
Where the hell is it?

[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:29.880]
Oh, no.

[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.940]
What after he's saying, I mean, that's a national anthem.

[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.500]
Well, I'm stall on for a time after he's saying,

[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.820]
take me out to the ball game and he said,

[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:38.820]
I thought that I would stop it so far.

[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.640]
And everybody in unison said, uh-huh.

[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.200]
Here's a mobile in Palm Beach.

[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:43.460]
Hello.

[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:45.020]
Hey, Neil.

[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:45.520]
Yes, sir.

[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.840]
Hey, good show, interesting show.

[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.160]
I respect your opinion.

[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:51.180]
Let me take for a minute.

[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:51.620]
Yes.

[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:57.880]
I'd like for you to go to the New Testament of the Bible.

[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.820]
And, uh, you know, that gives a good message.

[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:01.820]
Read that.

[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:02.220]
Where's that?

[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:03.900]
Read John 316.

[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.360]
And, uh, where are you going to start with that again?

[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.080]
You've been going to too many football games for John's health experience.

[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:10.920]
Yeah, I follow my logic for one minute.

[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:11.340]
Okay.

[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.200]
See, before you go on with your logic,

[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:14.240]
let me just say this one thing.

[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:14.580]
You okay?

[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:14.940]
Okay.

[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.780]
People who drive around with a little fish on the back of their car.

[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:18.060]
Yeah.

[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.200]
And people who go to sporting events holding up these signs, John 316.

[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:24.240]
These are intolerant people who should not be there.

[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:27.000]
They're unacceptable to me because they're flooding their beliefs,

[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.500]
which they're entitled to believe whatever they want.

[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:30.800]
They're flooding them in places where it doesn't belong.

[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:31.560]
That's right.

[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:33.740]
I don't want somebody out there sticking their religion,

[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.780]
I know, is when I'm driving my car in the highway

[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.380]
that I help pay for with my tax money.

[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:40.120]
And I certainly don't want somebody when I go to pay to go to a ballgame,

[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:43.060]
holding up those religious signs of any kind or denomination.

[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.260]
Well, God gave us free will, you know?

[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:46.720]
Yeah, we can, yeah, we can.

[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.180]
I mean, we can...

[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:49.760]
Sir, do you realize how stupid that is?

[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:50.780]
God is omniscient.

[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.520]
That means He knows everything.

[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:55.500]
And so we knew the outcome of all the decisions ahead of time.

[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:56.020]
Right.

[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.220]
Well, how can that be right?

[01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.460]
And man had free will.

[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.520]
Neil, let me ask you.

[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:00.740]
All right.

[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.460]
I agree with you about work.

[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.140]
No, sir, you said you would use that all day.

[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.700]
You wanted to have a conversation.

[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:07.620]
Listen to me.

[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:08.300]
Well, listen to me.

[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:09.600]
I want you to answer my question.

[01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:12.360]
If God knows ahead of time, what the hell...

[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.700]
He knows everything ahead of time.

[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:14.020]
Right.

[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:16.380]
How could He give man free will when He knew ahead of time

[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:17.640]
what choices man would make?

[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:19.500]
How could He have been dismayed and distraught

[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.320]
that they made the wrong choices when He already knew?

[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:22.560]
Why did He tempt them?

[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:23.620]
Why did He put...

[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:23.860]
Why did He...

[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.420]
Why did He give them the chance to fail

[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:27.620]
when He knew if given the chance they would fail?

[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:27.840]
Right.

[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.580]
I did not know the answer that question.

[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.480]
I couldn't pretend to know the answer that question.

[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.840]
Well, how can you bring something that makes so little sense?

[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:35.460]
I know something you don't know.

[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:35.860]
Yes.

[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.500]
I have had...

[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:40.940]
There's a difference between religion and the spiritual world.

[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:42.300]
I've had a...

[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.240]
And what is a spiritual world?

[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:46.060]
That is your relationship with God.

[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:47.800]
And as Jesus Christ.

[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:48.380]
Yeah.

[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:49.120]
I've had that.

[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.620]
I believe...

[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:51.580]
What does that mean?

[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.800]
Well, what that means is that...

[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.680]
That we replies that...

[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:56.540]
You know...

[01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:57.760]
That He was our Creator.

[01:16:58.220 --> 01:16:58.840]
Does that make...

[01:16:58.840 --> 01:16:59.500]
I mean...

[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.460]
It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.600]
First of all, when you say,

[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.060]
What does He got like two eyes in a mouth and a nose?

[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.220]
Is He got a big...

[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.120]
A tail like the devil?

[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:08.060]
What does that mean?

[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.580]
Well, let me...

[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:10.800]
Let me say this, you know...

[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:17.300]
I believe that we were created by a power bigger than ourselves.

[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.200]
Absolutely not.

[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:19.280]
Absolutely not.

[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:20.020]
Why do you say that?

[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:20.860]
Why do you mean...

[01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:21.800]
If you look at those...

[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:24.880]
You asked me a question, I give you an answer.

[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:26.140]
You just keep on talking.

[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.820]
Are you do not believe in God?

[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:28.280]
Of course not.

[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:28.640]
Right.

[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:29.120]
Okay.

[01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:29.900]
All right.

[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.320]
How could anybody believe anything so silly?

[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.780]
Well, I mean, what is your answer?

[01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:36.320]
My answer to what?

[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:37.760]
To how we're here.

[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.820]
My answer to how we're here.

[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.800]
How about if I give you three words, okay?

[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:42.120]
Yes.

[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:43.000]
I don't know.

[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:43.860]
All right.

[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.960]
Well, so you don't know.

[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:46.920]
Right?

[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:51.860]
Yes, and so I'm not going to make up some ridiculous story that somebody else...

[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:54.820]
You don't know how we're here.

[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:55.180]
Yes.

[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:55.820]
Okay.

[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.820]
And let me take it once that further.

[01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.420]
I don't know and I don't care.

[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.180]
All I know is that I am here.

[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:02.820]
And I'm going to make the best of it, okay?

[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:03.080]

[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.720]
I don't care about try to explore things for which I could never have the answer.

[01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:07.840]
They happen millions and billions of years ago.

[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.020]
We can't even...

[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:10.000]
Listen, I don't like that.

[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.280]
We can't even...

[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.940]
We can't even conceive what a thousand years is like.

[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:14.280]
Okay.

[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.220]
A hundred years maybe, because some people live a little over a hundred years.

[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:17.360]
Right.

[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.840]
But a thousand years is beyond our ability to understand to cope with.

[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:21.060]
Okay.

[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:28.040]
So the concept of understanding of dealing with millions of years or billions of years is so far beyond our scope to understand.

[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:28.600]
Right.

[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.100]
Then what's the point?

[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.300]
Well, the point is, you know, there are things that we don't know.

[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:33.920]
Yeah.

[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:34.860]
Oh, well, that's good.

[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:35.900]
That's a good start.

[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:38.100]
There are things that you and I don't know.

[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:40.880]
And let me...

[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.180]
What, your DNA...

[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.000]
That's a good thing.

[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:46.340]
Now, where did our moral...

[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:47.240]
The ender come from?

[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:48.440]
The Bible, correct?

[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:49.260]
No, of course not.

[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:50.780]
I doubt it's gonna kill.

[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:52.300]
All the things that you're saying...

[01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:53.260]
Sure, let me say it again.

[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:53.780]
Let me say it again.

[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.080]
Before these silly old men wrote that stuff, died.

[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:56.540]

[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:01.120]
Civilized people, which there were some actually back then, just through common sense.

[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:01.580]
Right.

[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.800]
Understood those things.

[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:03.140]
Right.

[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.780]
But the same book that you're talking about, I'll repeat it again.

[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:06.680]
It's only one example.

[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:07.100]
Right.

[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:11.280]
Says, disobedient children, shall surely be stoned to death.

[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:12.920]
That's the Old Testament, Dale.

[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:13.420]
Yeah.

[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:14.700]
Okay. And people...

[01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:16.260]
People are people that...

[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:16.800]
They're people that are making and choosing.

[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.540]
You can't have the New Testament without the Old Testament, because Jesus was a Jew.

[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:21.360]
It's all for...

[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.440]
Hey, Jesus was a Jew.

[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:22.860]
You bet.

[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:23.760]
You bet he was.

[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:27.020]
And you came now, follow my life for one minute.

[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:28.520]
I respect your opinion.

[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.900]
Did Jesus refute any of the Old Testament?

[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.100]
All right, let me...

[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.100]
No, just follow the life.

[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.260]
I want you to answer my question.

[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:35.520]
Okay.

[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:40.240]
Did Jesus anywhere in the Scriptures refute anything that it says in the Old Testament?

[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.480]
I don't know with the...

[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.040]
I don't know if he would answer to.

[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:44.320]
He had told me that he would not do five-seventeen.

[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.080]
Hey, Dale.

[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:46.580]
Yes.

[01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:48.140]
I don't know if he was asked to.

[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.580]
I mean, did somebody ask him about that?

[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:54.080]
Well, if he had a purpose of giving the people the real word about what...

[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.820]
What salvation is all about.

[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.900]
If there was something in there that was wrong, of course he would have said...

[01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.460]
He would have done it, but he didn't do it.

[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.300]
Dale, he came to be an example of how to live.

[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:04.460]
And he...

[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:07.400]
He talked about the same thing about religion that you're talking about.

[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.560]
Sir, I want to tell you something.

[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:08.760]
Yes.

[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:14.040]
There's a very, very high probability that there was never any such person as Jesus Christ, okay?

[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.040]
Well, I mean, you know, that's an opinion.

[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:19.360]
No, it's not an opinion.

[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:19.940]
It's a fact.

[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.520]
There's a very high probability that he never existed.

[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:27.100]
Well, I mean, that's something, you know, that that...

[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:31.000]
Obviously, as your opinion, or there isn't a opinion of people that that didn't happen.

[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:31.620]
Yeah.

[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:32.740]
Let me...

[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:33.360]
Let me ask you this.

[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:34.700]
Let me get back to one thing.

[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:35.920]
Who killed President Kennedy?

[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.700]
Who killed President Kennedy?

[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:37.960]
Yeah.

[01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:39.300]
I don't know for sure.

[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:40.320]
And now, when did that happen?

[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:42.240]
That happened in 1963.

[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:42.820]
Right.

[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.400]
That's 35 years ago, right?

[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:44.940]

[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:45.040]

[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:49.260]
Now, how can you be so positive about something that allegedly happened 2,000 years ago?

[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:57.340]
Well, because I've had a spiritual experience, I won't use religion because we're...

[01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:01.300]
You know, religion has problems because men and women are in charge of it.

[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:02.820]
What is a spiritual experience?

[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.780]
I'll tell you.

[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.760]
I have to think like you did, okay?

[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.820]
And there's nothing wrong with that.

[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:13.900]
But I also used to drink alcohol for 30 years.

[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:14.320]
Oh, okay.

[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:15.000]
Thank you, sir.

[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:15.880]
Thank you very much.

[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:17.320]
Wow.

[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.980]
We finally got to the bottom line.

[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:20.740]
From what addictions?

[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:21.420]
Right.

[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:25.720]
Say hi to our friends over there at Paxton, who were all there over there before we got out.

[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:28.700]
All those recovering alcoholism.

[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.540]
I'm not going to recover alcoholism, okay?

[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.360]
But if you would have said that at the very beginning of the call,

[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.800]
and we could have gone through the whole 13-step program,

[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.520]
and we could have saved a hell of a lot of time,

[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:38.760]
and if that's what helps you make it through today,

[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.000]
without a little bit of...

[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:40.480]
What are you doing?

[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.580]
More power to you, okay?

[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:45.240]
Maybe it'll help me stop eating sugar and starts.

[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:46.580]
Maybe I should pick up the good book.

[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:48.400]
Okay, let's go back here and get the Bible.

[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:49.700]
Okay?

[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.520]
I'm holding the Bible right here.

[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.400]
The Old Testament, the New Testament, is it in here?

[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:54.700]
I'm squeezing it.

[01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:56.660]
I got my hands on it and the Bible too.

[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.140]
And I'm still on Starch and Sugar.

[01:21:58.300 --> 01:21:58.780]
How do you like that?

[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:01.520]
Isn't that said?

[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:01.920]
Didn't work.

[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:03.320]
Well, I haven't worked that hard enough yet.

[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:04.620]
Okay, I haven't even got to the first step.

[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:05.540]
Much less the second one.

[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:08.660]
Oh my God.

[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:11.880]
I apologize profusely to myself.

[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:15.420]
But like I said, you know, I give these people a ton of time

[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:17.620]
because I'm waiting for the punchline.

[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:19.260]
And the punchline was,

[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:21.660]
he's recovering alcoholic and therefore, you know,

[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:22.340]
he said her in so on.

[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:22.680]
Great.

[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:25.160]
Here's a lady in our West Palm.

[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:25.500]
Hello.

[01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:26.400]
Hello.

[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:27.180]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:28.500]
Hi, my name's Kelly.

[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.540]
This is Neil, right?

[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.200]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:30.620]
Oh, good.

[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.360]
Hang on one second.

[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:32.980]
Sure.

[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:35.260]
Okay, let's see if that made the echo go away.

[01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:35.980]
It works like a charm.

[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:36.500]
Yes, go ahead.

[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:36.680]
Okay.

[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:39.880]
Well, I agree with your new religion.

[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:44.320]
But I'm also a personal relationship with Jesus Christ,

[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.200]
I do think is quite important.

[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:47.540]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.520]
A personal relationship?

[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:49.540]
Did he come over for dinner?

[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.540]
No, he's not going to plan it heaven.

[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:54.800]
But, you know, he's a planet heaven.

[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:56.600]
Planet heaven or planet hell?

[01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:56.900]
Planet heaven.

[01:22:56.900 --> 01:22:56.900]

[01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:57.880]
Planet heaven.

[01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.240]
How's under the ground?

[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:00.440]
4000 miles down.

[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.260]
Under the ground, he's down there with Pat Boone,

[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.620]
the journey to the center of the earth.

[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.080]
Yeah, hell's in the center of the earth.

[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:07.820]
That's what they say.

[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:10.620]
The center of the earth is like a molten, hot plastic.

[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:11.660]
Yeah.

[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:12.680]
That's where hell is.

[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:13.240]
Uh-huh.

[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.440]
And, you know, the lake fire is down there too.

[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:15.960]
Oh, yeah.

[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:16.380]
Yeah.

[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:22.920]
So, um, but I agree with you know, if everybody would do no harm to everybody else,

[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:25.560]
it would be great, except that there is a real devil.

[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:27.160]
And there is evil in the world.

[01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:27.840]
There's a real devil.

[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.840]
How come God doesn't hear rid of the devil, ma'am?

[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:34.020]
Well, um, the devil, he can't get rid of the devil because he, he,

[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:35.540]
he provides by his own laws.

[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:40.000]
If he says something, if he says something, he's not going to go back on.

[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.900]
How about, how about when he got rid of all of Ma'am kind except Noah and his family with the Ark when he got pissed off

[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:46.200]
because Ma'am was acting pretty goofy.

[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:46.900]
He didn't like it.

[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:48.580]
Oh, what do you mean he can't go back on his own word?

[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:50.020]
He changes his mind all the time.

[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:51.920]
Well, he didn't, he didn't change his word there.

[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:54.940]
He, he never said that he wouldn't destroy Ma'am kind of.

[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:55.260]
Yeah.

[01:23:55.460 --> 01:24:00.700]
Well, what kind of a loving, kind of a loving God destroys Ma'am kind instead of looking down away with his magic finger

[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:03.140]
and makes Ma'am obedient and stop doing all the crap around.

[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:07.440]
What, Ma'am, what, what kind of a sick creature are you talking about that you placed your faith in

[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:10.980]
that just Willie Nilly keeps destroying all his life that he created?

[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:12.600]
He, God the Father does say he did.

[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.000]
Sounds like a mad professor to me.

[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:16.460]
He is God the Father and then there's the sun.

[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.140]
Okay, thank you.

[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:22.080]
She's not responding like you'd expect because you can't.

[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:26.900]
We have an open line at Broward, 5-San and it's, it's sad.

[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.720]
These are living and breathing people and they're just repeating by wrote.

[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:37.020]
The same crap that's been pounded into their heads since they were little children.

[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:42.780]
Oh, and God that's the Strother and the Son of Hail Mary, Holy Mother of God, by the name of God.

[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:43.280]
Yeah, right.

[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:47.060]
Say 6,000 Hail Mary's and we can stop all of this book.

[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:50.080]
Say 200,000 Hail Mary's it'll keep you off the street.

[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:55.860]
You're rubbing a rosary beads and Father of Tools and Aaron, he's rubbing something else.

[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.080]
I guarantee you that right now.

[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.400]
Because he wants to alter your life.

[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:05.380]
Well, what answer do you have?

[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:06.200]
I don't have any answers.

[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:07.340]
I don't want any answers.

[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:08.440]
I don't really give a crap.

[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:10.180]
Doesn't interest me in the least bit.

[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:17.400]
Be like winding up in the middle of downtown Manhattan without a car without any clothing.

[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:21.600]
But you got, you know, in your wallet you got $5 million in cold cash somehow.

[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.880]
You just wake up one day and there you are.

[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:28.240]
In a plush pet house suite at some hotel in Manhattan.

[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:33.260]
Now, are you going to say to yourself, how did I get here? Where did I come from?

[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:35.080]
No, you're going to go out there and have a good time.

[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:38.820]
Or you're going to hop on a plane and go wherever you want to go. That's it.

[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:44.980]
127 and 5, I'll tell you to be out of shadow. But this is beyond religion. That's Ben and Jerry's.

[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:51.540]
I'm squeezing it tightly. Do I still want Ben and Jerry's? Do I still have those sugar cravings?

[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.980]
You bet your sweet ass I did.

[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:54.400]
Hey, hey.

[01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:57.020]
Reunion.

[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:09.240]
All the white folks hate the black folks and the black folks hate the white folks to hate all but the right folks

[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:16.800]
is an old established rule but during national brotherhood week, national brotherhood week,

[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:30.040]
lean or horn and sheriff Clark are dancing cheap to cheegets, fun to utilize but people you despise as long as you don't let them in your school.

[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:39.560]
All the poor folks hate the rich folks and the rich folks hate the poor folks. All of my folks hate all of your folks.

[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.460]
It's American as apple pie.

[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.360]
I love you, ring.

[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:51.440]
National brotherhood week, national brotherhood week, New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans cause it's very cheap.

[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:59.160]
Step up and shake the hand of someone you can't stand. You can tolerate him if you try.

[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:12.460]
All the Protestants hate the Catholics and the Catholics hate the Protestants and the Hindus hate the Muslims and everybody hates the Jews but during

[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:26.300]
national brotherhood, national brotherhood week, national everyone smile at one and nothing good week be nice to people who are inferior to you.

[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:29.460]
It's only for a week so have no fear.

[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:33.920]
Be grateful that it doesn't last all year.

[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:38.820]
That's the American way.

[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:42.100]
You said it sweetheart 133 at 560 WQAM.

[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.900]
Here's a mobile in homestead. Hello.

[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:46.780]
Hello. Yes sir.

[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:54.140]
Neil, I've been following your advice and thinking for myself and it's provoked two questions for you.

[01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:54.620]
Yes sir.

[01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:05.360]
The first is, you know, you are encouraging all of the older people in date county to get out because it would improve the county significantly.

[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:06.320]
I'm what?

[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:10.400]
You are encouraging all of the old people to get out of date.

[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.320]
What did I say that?

[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:12.600]
Oh frequently.

[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:16.400]
What are the problems with date county is that there are so many old people.

[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.920]
No, that's Broward County. You got a backwards here. That's Broward.

[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:20.400]
Well Broward or date.

[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:21.080]
No Broward.

[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.340]
I think that's the same.

[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.280]
Yes. No, it's not the same. Not at all.

[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:29.800]
Well, I've seen a couple of pictures of you and you don't appear to be a teenager to me.

[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:31.920]
Yeah. I'm a scary old teenager.

[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:32.380]
You are.

[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:34.780]
I'm a teenager. What does that have to do with anything?

[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:40.960]
Well, I mean, if you fall into the category of one of those old people, are you going to take your oldman's life and get out of town?

[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:44.860]
Well, I'll be out of this town long before I ever become a senior citizen. I'll guarantee you that.

[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.280]
I think you've been saying that for a while.

[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.360]
Haven't you nearer?

[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:51.220]
Sure. I've been saying it for 22 and a half years and I'll say it again.

[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:53.940]
Broward County is an outdoor funeral parlor. That's right.

[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:56.120]
Yeah. All right. Second question.

[01:28:56.220 --> 01:29:00.160]
The demographics here are skewed. They're upside down. This is not a real community.

[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:02.500]
You can't go to any other city in the world or real city.

[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:06.640]
A real metropolitan area and see such a disproportionate number of old people.

[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.280]
Not nowhere.

[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:08.960]
Question two.

[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:09.500]
Yes, sir.

[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.260]
And I'm not trying to beat you.

[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.400]
No, obviously not. Not after the first go part of the conversation. Obviously not.

[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:16.920]
You and your side.

[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.760]
I think you said such a great thinker. Yes.

[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:23.480]
I, you know, are obviously anti-religious. Very, very much so. Yes.

[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:24.220]
Very.

[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:24.700]
Okay.

[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:28.160]
Am I entitled to be on the air expressing that viewpoint?

[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:29.100]
Of course you are.

[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:29.860]
Okay. And I will.

[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:30.540]
Of course you are.

[01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:31.120]
And I do.

[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:32.920]
But my question is.

[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:35.760]
Yes. Why then do you wear a Yamago?

[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.020]
Because it's a joke, sir.

[01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:39.800]
And if you're too stupid to understand it, because it's a joke.

[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:43.320]
And if you don't get the, if you don't get the symbolism of it, then I can't help you.

[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.600]
I thought you said that I had taught you to think for yourself.

[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.340]
Gorners, tell him in your case, okay?

[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:52.520]
That's exactly why I wear it to point out how silly it looks and how ridiculous it is.

[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.740]
Got it. And you understand it.

[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:54.940]
No.

[01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:55.660]
No, he doesn't get it.

[01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:59.180]
But he's got the Dayton-broward backwards. So, you know, what can I say?

[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:04.160]
In addition to which I'm not wearing a skull cap anymore, I'm wearing a nice baseball cap now.

[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:09.400]
Maybe it's a postcard with a pregnant pole on there. Maybe it's this one.

[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.580]
That would be good. The one that says, would he be more careful?

[01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:13.080]
It was him that was the God pregnant.

[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:16.420]
It says the rhythm method. It's not infallible. But then who is?

[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:20.140]
How do you like that? There's the pregnant pope. What a pregnant idea.

[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:21.800]
Either that or he just had one whale of a meal.

[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.020]
Maybe too much french food for the pope.

[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:26.840]
Maybe too many killed bosses, huh?

[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:30.280]
Maybe too many parogies there. Lots of Polish food.

[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:33.420]
They make you balloon up like a, like a mania, like a walrus.

[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:37.620]
Don't you love those pedantic old guys like this one?

[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:41.440]
The pedantic ones who top down to you, like they're so articulate and so on.

[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:43.380]
And then they turn out to be total bozos.

[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:49.940]
It's a joke, sir. The armaka is a joke. It's a satire. Do you understand what that means?

[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:51.820]
No. Okay, thank you.

[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:54.080]
Mobile in Miami. Hello?

[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.700]
Hello, meal. Good afternoon, sir.

[01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:59.560]
Good afternoon, sir. I get kept me on hold for a damn long.

[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000]
Hey, how you doing today?

[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:02.580]
Okay.

[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:06.940]
I would like some pressing engagement or something.

[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:07.700]
You like going anywhere?

[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:11.140]
I'd like to join your organization.

[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:12.600]
Yes? Organization?

[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:17.520]
I'd also like to sign up my two children and my wife.

[01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:19.120]
I'd be more of us.

[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:19.440]
Yeah.

[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.980]
And came up to 6,000 now.

[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:24.220]
Thanks, Neil. You know you're the best.

[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:24.840]
Listen up.

[01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:28.260]
I was flipping around the station last night, the TV.

[01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:34.420]
And there was some guy, John Stoffel, you know the reporter.

[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:37.900]
He was on ABC. He was talking about John Assle.

[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:38.660]
Yeah.

[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:41.420]
There was talking about these people who were channelers.

[01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:45.920]
They channeled other people from other worlds and all that.

[01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:51.580]
Now this one guy and this one from Brazil had to hope so many people in the believing

[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:56.220]
that he was channeling some guy who was like two, three hundred year old.

[01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:59.520]
And the guy who comes out of the house.

[01:31:59.620 --> 01:31:59.800]
Yeah.

[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:05.580]
The guy would be in one room and he would be telling him the answers and the media

[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:08.180]
would be having them, these answers and these questions.

[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:11.800]
And it was so hilarious and when it came out that it was all host,

[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:14.760]
this was like maybe 10 years ago, maybe 10 years ago,

[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:16.780]
that these people still believed it.

[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:18.000]
They were sure we can't be.

[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:20.660]
It's just like the people that are still sending money to Jimmy Swagger.

[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:21.180]
That's right.

[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:24.020]
It was unbelievable how these people just were very believable.

[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:26.000]
Oh, it's very believable.

[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.700]
How these people just were like, they would say we do anything they could in the world.

[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:30.460]
Yeah.

[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:33.500]
To believe this guy and then they came out.

[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:34.960]
Well, let me tell you one thing.

[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.060]
Sure, just keep this in mind.

[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:37.760]
It's good for making money sometime in the future.

[01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:39.000]
There's a lot of dummies out there.

[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:39.640]
Just keep going on.

[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:46.740]
One of the problems was, you know, was the media because nobody would take and investigate this guy.

[01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:53.280]
And one of the things that they said that he did was that his part would stop when this guy channeled through him.

[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.440]
And the guy showed the trick or what they would do.

[01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:58.260]
They would pull rubber ball on his rib.

[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:01.300]
And he would push it while his nurse was taking a pole.

[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:02.560]
And it stopped it.

[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:03.640]
It was such a joke.

[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:04.520]
It was so hilarious.

[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:06.680]
Well, anybody who believes that crap is definitely got rubber balls.

[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:08.000]
He deals with a heavy ester and closing.

[01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:08.380]
Deal?

[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:08.920]
Yes.

[01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:09.920]
Oh, yeah.

[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:10.480]
Okay.

[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:13.360]
22 till 2 at 5.60.

[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:13.840]
L.

[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.160]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:18.980]
We're having sweet honey.

[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:20.580]
Oh, right.

[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.860]
Nothing much to do with that.

[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:24.920]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:40.360]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:40.420]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:40.460]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:40.740]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:40.820]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:41.900]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:42.480]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:42.620]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:44.060]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.760]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:46.460]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:50.360]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.080]
I'm heaven rake.

[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.720]
All of them debts yes.

[01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:58.100]
Who has been waving by light.

[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:00.800]
Going to serious.

[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.040]
Searing up we die.

[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:08.240]
All right.

[01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:09.360]
Let's do it.

[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:10.360]
16 to 2.

[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:11.520]
And they did.

[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:12.220]
60.

[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.200]
How about some cool aid?

[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:14.080]
How come I let's go?

[01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:15.600]
How about some of putting?

[01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:18.340]
We have an open line and Dave won in Broward.

[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:19.780]
5.607.05.60.

[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:22.780]
We want bumper stickers.

[01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:23.640]
We want buttons.

[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:24.800]
We want paraphernalia.

[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:24.960]
What?

[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:26.540]
What?

[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:27.840]
Hello?

[01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:30.580]
Hello?

[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:32.560]
It was him.

[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:33.700]
Oh, but there you go.

[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:38.140]
Here's this great courageous old fart that's bugging George all day calling 10 million times.

[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:41.580]
The raggedy old voice is going to get me off the air and I should die for maybe the...

[01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:43.160]
But he don't have the balls to go on the air.

[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.400]
Isn't that something?

[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:46.280]
You cowardly piece of turd.

[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:47.900]
Isn't that beautiful?

[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:48.880]
You turd.

[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:49.180]
Nice.

[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.400]
What does that tell you?

[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:57.260]
You know what it sounds like to me when you come right when you cut away all the bull crap?

[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:58.880]
You know what it sounds like?

[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.320]
He's an Ojón provocateur.

[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:00.720]
Exactly.

[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:01.740]
A crap disturbance.

[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:04.860]
Balls do you foul.

[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:06.940]
Don't want to go on the air and have all your good friends out there.

[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:10.320]
Both of them hear your voice and have you show an asshole you are to the universe.

[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:12.160]
Show your big fat ugly pimpley.

[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:12.880]
Rack them the world.

[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:14.800]
Dear field beach.

[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:15.020]

[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:16.400]
Where are you going?

[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.060]
Okay, let's go to that one.

[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:18.440]
Isn't that what it was?

[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:19.640]
Oh, that was just an asshole.

[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:21.220]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:21.580]
Hello.

[01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:23.060]
Hello, Neil.

[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:23.480]
Yes, sir.

[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:24.340]
How you doing, sir?

[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:24.860]
I'm kind of like Woody.

[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:25.240]
Okay.

[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:25.920]
Good.

[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:28.700]
I agree with the 1000 percent on what you're talking about today.

[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:29.080]
Yes.

[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:30.980]
I got some, I think you'll find plenty.

[01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:33.920]
I was just pulling on to the highway and I saw one of these big billboards.

[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:34.320]
Yeah.

[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.380]
See those signs from God.

[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:36.680]
And I haven't seen any of me.

[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:38.700]
I had a lot of calls about them and I read that thing on the paper.

[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:39.560]
I haven't seen any yet.

[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:41.320]
Well, one of them says I'll come out.

[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:43.200]
It says on commercial boulevard.

[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:46.860]
If you keep using my name in vain, I'll make your rush hour longer.

[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:47.700]
Yeah, I saw that.

[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:48.180]
Isn't that great?

[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:49.000]
Well, that's typical.

[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:50.340]
That's the kind of God the inventive.

[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:51.020]
He's a satist.

[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:53.040]
He likes making life miserable for God.

[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:53.960]
No, we'll pay for that.

[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.080]
Does God himself pay for that?

[01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:55.940]
God has paid for it.

[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:56.280]
That's right.

[01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:57.280]
He said, don't be trusted.

[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.580]
When he put up a bunch of billboards.

[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:00.660]
I thought I let you know that, Neil.

[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:01.740]
Okay. Thanks for the good news.

[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:02.380]
Thank you.

[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:03.440]
And bless you, my child.

[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:03.940]
Thank you.

[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:04.920]
Bless you.

[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.940]
We have an open line in Broward to invade.

[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:08.880]
They all come out.

[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:11.100]
All the good, religious, if you believe that way,

[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:12.360]
you're going to burn in hell.

[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:13.680]
All those good people.

[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:15.260]
And of course, that makes my point for me.

[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:16.220]
I love it.

[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:17.660]
Oh, seriously?

[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:19.180]
They make your point for you.

[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:22.100]
You're going to burn it, have you, evil, have you.

[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:22.620]
Right.

[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:24.440]
There you go.

[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:26.640]
Just like Tom Lear was singing before,

[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:28.380]
the Protestants and the Catholics and the Jews

[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:29.840]
and the Arabs and this one and that one.

[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:32.060]
I'll kill each other for thousands of years now.

[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:33.480]
And we still can't learn our lesson.

[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:34.560]
To just be people.

[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.240]
And DNH, do no harm.

[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.300]
And just leave everybody alone.

[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:40.200]
And stop teaching and breeding hatred

[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:41.980]
and intolerance and stupidity.

[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:43.260]
Because that's what it's all about.

[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:45.600]
Oh, but the good book says.

[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:46.040]
Yeah.

[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:49.080]
And who are disobedient children?

[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:50.620]
Surely be stoned to death.

[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:51.740]
Oi!

[01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:53.840]
Can you imagine that today?

[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:57.300]
Can you imagine all the TV shows we could have on Earth?

[01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.140]
We could make Wamy the Stoning Station.

[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.140]
Then they might get an audience.

[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:03.460]
All those bratty little kids that are doing all those evil things.

[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:06.000]
Just like every 15 minutes, we'll stoned another one to that.

[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.400]
It's right there on the channel or whatever it is.

[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:08.000]
Yeah, that's it.

[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:08.480]
Oh, God.

[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:10.600]
Now, that's a...

[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:11.880]
You don't waste any time with stones.

[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.280]
Because the kids are all stoned.

[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:15.360]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:16.160]
Hello.

[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:18.500]
Neil.

[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:18.980]
Yes, sir.

[01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:19.960]
Enjoy the show.

[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:21.380]
It's a good discussion today.

[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:28.720]
I don't believe that man's born with the sense of a pumpkin

[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:30.460]
or you're calling a common sense.

[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:31.460]
He's not?

[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.100]
Am I questioning with the DNH?

[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.900]
He's not born with common sense?

[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:37.920]
No, I mean common sense or conscience is learned.

[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:38.760]
It's taught.

[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:43.200]
And that would be the role of religion is to be fine.

[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:45.100]
Let me ask you this question.

[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.600]
Do you ever have a dog in your life?

[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:48.560]
No, I have not.

[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:50.820]
But you've been around dogs, I'm sure.

[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:51.580]
Right, right.

[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.300]
Now, when you're around other people's dogs, for example,

[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:55.740]
do those dogs bite off your hand?

[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:58.480]
Not necessarily, no.

[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:02.200]
No, I don't mean not necessarily, but do they do it?

[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:03.160]
No.

[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:04.180]
No, they don't do that.

[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:05.360]
Do they attack you?

[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:06.620]
Do they rip your neck off?

[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:09.740]
Do they open up big gouges of bloody wounds in your body?

[01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:12.320]
Well, some might try if they're brought up.

[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:12.880]
No, no, no.

[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:15.040]
We're talking about dogs that are in bread for that.

[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:16.020]
We're not talking about pitfalls.

[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.640]
I'm talking about your average ordinary dog.

[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:19.240]
No, they don't.

[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:19.820]
And why is that?

[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:24.800]
Because hopefully because they're upbringing from their owner.

[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:24.980]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:25.880]
See, there is no.

[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.640]
You can't sit down and say to a dog,

[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:29.820]
because I have two dogs, have raised them since they were little puppies.

[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:30.180]
Okay?

[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:34.340]
You can't say to a dog, don't chew this guy's hand dog.

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:39.400]
The dog instinctively knows certain things at birth instinctively

[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:40.740]
knows right from wrong.

[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:42.160]
Animals breed, right?

[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:45.680]
Does somebody teach animals the facts of life, the birds and the bees?

[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:48.440]
Of course not, because they know it instinctively.

[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:51.320]
But my point is they're certain things that are instinctive.

[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:53.860]
And they're the basic knowing right from wrong,

[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:55.620]
you don't have to read it in a book.

[01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:58.520]
You know that if I have a car,

[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:00.480]
you don't take the keys and drive away with it.

[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:02.920]
That's common sense it has, and you're born with it.

[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.580]
Nobody has to teach you that.

[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.900]
So you it is because of your upbringing.

[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:12.100]
But let's do an example that's a little more not so clear.

[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:14.180]
You like to gamble right, you go to the track,

[01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:16.180]
and you like to, as you call it,

[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:17.060]
plunge your brains out.

[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:19.020]
No, I don't plan to have my relics to gamble a little bit, yeah.

[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:20.300]
You have the means to do that.

[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:20.560]
Yeah.

[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:23.500]
Let's say a man with a family goes to the track

[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:27.060]
and spends his last hundred dollars that was supposed to go for groceries.

[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:30.520]
Now has he harmed his family when he went out?

[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:32.240]
Well, what does that have to do with what we're talking about?

[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:36.180]
Well, I'm saying it's somebody talking about a guy that's got a compulsive gambling habit.

[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.280]
No, it's not what he has a drinking habit.

[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:40.660]
What does that have to do with common sense?

[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:43.100]
You know, somebody has to define what harm is,

[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:45.280]
and that is the role the religion takes.

[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:46.740]
Religion defines all.

[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:48.720]
No, ruster, that is not the role religion takes.

[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:49.980]
That's the role that we all know.

[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:52.900]
Let me say to you again very clearly, read my lips,

[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.600]
that's the role the law takes.

[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:58.700]
That's the role of the law to define what's right from wrong, not religion.

[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:02.740]
Just like the Christian scientists, like this one over in Tampa a few days ago,

[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:06.080]
that let their little kid, two-year-old kid die after he got the beastings,

[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:07.520]
just like that disgusting thing.

[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:08.820]
That's not the role of religion,

[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:11.800]
and it's been overruled by the law in this country time and time again,

[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:12.980]
and hopefully always will be,

[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:17.180]
because just because people are crazy with their religious above the license and superstition

[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:19.240]
doesn't give them a right to do harm to their children.

[01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:24.280]
You're right, but religion will, people who believe in the religious foundation of law,

[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:27.200]
will tell you that law came out of religion not the other way around.

[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:33.160]
And so you always have to have some defining set of rules and any of what religion,

[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:33.620]
sir.

[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:34.860]
Law came out of what religion?

[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:39.680]
Well, what, the think of mailings or the basis for all is what a Christian is.

[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:42.300]
Are they really all laws in the world came from the Ten Commandments?

[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:42.960]
How about the...

[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:43.560]
I love any answer.

[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:44.560]
Let me ask you this.

[01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:47.060]
How did the Asians learn about the Ten Commandments?

[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:49.180]
Where was the Old Testament in Asia?

[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:50.580]
Well, I don't know.

[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:52.820]
I haven't been to church in three years,

[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:53.780]
so I'm just telling you,

[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.180]
no matter what,

[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:56.400]
I'm murder.

[01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:56.980]
I'm murder.

[01:40:56.980 --> 01:41:01.060]
I was murder, ever legal in Asia and Chinese or Japanese society was never legal

[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:02.640]
because they didn't know the Ten Commandments.

[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:04.780]
So somebody defined in their society that they knew?

[01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:08.520]
Somebody defined it, but how could they possibly define it unless it was just common sense?

[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:13.100]
I don't know the answer to that, but what I'm telling you is people are going to tell you.

[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:13.980]
Well, how can we ever come?

[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:15.900]
Sir, how can we have a conversation?

[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:19.220]
I'm trying desperately, especially with people who disagree with me.

[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:21.380]
I'm trying desperately because I'm seeing...

[01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:21.920]
I'm not disagreeing.

[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:24.400]
I'm just telling you that you will have to know how to respond.

[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:25.800]
You won't answer my questions.

[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:30.420]
You have to define harm, and you can't define what harm is to everybody and say,

[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:31.660]
and everybody agrees.

[01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:32.900]
So that's where...

[01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:34.120]
Well, let me ask you this.

[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:38.180]
Where is the great area by doing harm to another person?

[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:39.240]
Where is the great area?

[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:43.280]
Because what's harmful to you because of your upbringing in your background?

[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:44.420]
Sir, just a minute.

[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:47.340]
You're talking about people with compulsive gambling problems.

[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:48.060]
Oh, it's not.

[01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:49.880]
But to the gambler,

[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:51.300]
does he see that that's harmful?

[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:52.340]
No, maybe not.

[01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:56.220]
Of course he does when he goes home and he can't pay his bills and his family is starving to death.

[01:41:56.420 --> 01:41:56.900]
Of course he does.

[01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:58.840]
And that's exactly what I'm saying.

[01:41:59.000 --> 01:41:59.760]
Do no harm.

[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:02.960]
If he's harming his family, if he's harming his family, what is it?

[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:04.460]
So you, that's how it's done.

[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:06.280]
It's because the gambler who's compulsive, it's not.

[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:07.480]
No, he knows that.

[01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:08.020]
Sir, you're wrong.

[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:08.680]
He knows it.

[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:10.880]
When he goes back and he keeps getting deeper and deeper.

[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:12.140]
Sir, you don't want...

[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:14.180]
Do you want to have a conversation because you make no sense?

[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:17.200]
Do no harm.

[01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:19.880]
And when you're harming yourself or other people, if you want to harm yourself,

[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:20.980]
that's your own business, I guess.

[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.060]
Well, when it affects other people, that's harm.

[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:28.680]
It's not some big, great area that we have to have a God then committee on and have a big discussion about.

[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:29.820]
Very, it's common sense.

[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:32.760]
Not complicated.

[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:35.560]
152.

[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:37.820]
But again, they got that 12-step program, so he'll be all right.

[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:38.740]
Eight minutes.

[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.400]
Probably, but obviously, you're right.

[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.980]
Oh, this guy's not worth the worth wasting time with.

[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:45.180]
I thought it was somebody like, you know, interesting.

[01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:47.620]
This guy's not worth the way to know.

[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:51.060]
There's some older disgusting, decrepit piece of crap on the beach.

[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:53.260]
All I can say is, you turd.

[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:53.960]
Give me a break.

[01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:56.380]
I didn't even let him on long enough to call you a thug.

[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:59.960]
I don't care about that, but this guy's worth the weight in the little online.

[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:03.300]
This guy's a hundred and a half days, got four feet in the grave this guy.

[01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:08.480]
Jesus Christ, there's a baby's being put in dumpsters, this old fart's taken up space.

[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:10.800]
Dear field, hello.

[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:12.360]
Hello.

[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:12.980]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:19.380]
Yeah, 15 years ago in Montreal, it was a guy who had a radio program, a sports program called Ted Teven.

[01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:19.920]
Yes.

[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:28.420]
All of a sudden, every time there was a Canadian talky game on, in between periods, some guy would fall out and start getting an analysis of the game.

[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:31.240]
You know what I got was Ron Rouge.

[01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:33.400]
Well, let me tell you something.

[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:40.020]
Three months later, after six years on the air, Ted Teven gets fired and who takes his job, Ron Rouge.

[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:40.760]
Yeah.

[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:42.740]
I always job from him.

[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:43.840]
What does that have to do with?

[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:45.100]
I don't have no idea who that is.

[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.400]
But right here, all the federal Ron Rouge calling your program.

[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:48.060]
His Ron Rouge.

[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:51.060]
Which caller is Ron Rouge?

[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:54.720]
Ron Rouge is the guy who gives the hockey games.

[01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:57.600]
Who gives the hockey games what?

[01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:01.740]
Who analyzes the hockey games? Is he an answer, is he?

[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:04.980]
No, he's not. We don't have anybody here named Ron Rouge.

[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:06.940]
Not Ron Rouge, he's the other guy.

[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.160]
Yeah, okay. Whatever you say.

[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.300]
Go back to Montreal, okay, if you'll please.

[01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:11.500]
Yeah, back to Shari.

[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:12.900]
Hope this guy up with the other one.

[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:15.240]
With the old Lunatic on the beach, man.

[01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:16.100]
A match made in heaven.

[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:17.460]
Woo!

[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:20.380]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:21.440]
Hey, Neil.

[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:22.060]
Yes, sir.

[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:23.120]
Give me a favor.

[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:24.420]
Forget all those guys.

[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.680]
Those guys are a bunch of punches and smuckers.

[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:27.980]
That guy from Miami Beach.

[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:29.400]
Neil, give me a favor.

[01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:30.840]
Give me a little Larry King.

[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.400]
Here's our friend of yes, none. Hello.

[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:34.760]
Hi, Neil.

[01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:35.380]
Yes, man.

[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:35.960]
How are you?

[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:36.300]
I'm fine.

[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:36.840]
Okay, I got one minute.

[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:38.260]
I've been very quickly.

[01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:39.740]
Let me tell you why I'm an ex-nun.

[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:42.740]
Because if I had to teach one more child to hear

[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:43.840]
a Mario was going to scream.

[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:46.580]
And that's the reason why I got out of the content.

[01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:50.820]
Because I couldn't, I really couldn't in conscience try and

[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:55.640]
take young minds and put them into that particular frame of mind.

[01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:57.160]
So that's it.

[01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:57.760]
Okay.

[01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:58.280]
Okay.

[01:44:58.520 --> 01:44:58.940]
Have a good one.

[01:44:59.380 --> 01:44:59.960]
Bye-bye.

[01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:01.880]
There's our friend, the ex-nun.

[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:03.740]
She got out of it because she knew what was a bad habit.

[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:04.540]
That's right.

[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:07.700]
And she got tired of shaving her headball too, by the way.

[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:09.320]
So anyway, that's going to do.

[01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:12.020]
Do we have one call around here today that made any sense in the,

[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:12.940]
of course not.

[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.880]
D-N-H, we want bumper stickers.

[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:17.020]
We want pins.

[01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:17.880]
We want signs.

[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:18.800]
We want billboards.

[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:19.880]
Do no harm, man.

[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:20.140]
No.

[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:21.280]
Very common sense.

[01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:22.380]
Do no harm.

[01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:23.000]
That's it.

[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:23.820]
That's our new deal.

[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:25.680]
Doesn't cost you a dime to join.

[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:27.440]
Don't have to rush to temple.

[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:27.860]
The church.

[01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:29.540]
You don't have to pay any dues and fees.

[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:30.280]
Can I borrow money?

[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:30.440]

[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:30.520]

[01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:31.300]
Any faith hevers?

[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:31.840]
What is it?

[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:32.800]
Hello?

[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:33.640]
Hey.

[01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:34.420]
Neil.

[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:35.180]
Yes, Hank.

[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:36.560]
Oh, I got a story for you.

[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:36.940]
You'll love.

[01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:40.720]
I got a call yesterday from a reporter in Las Vegas.

[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:44.980]
So you'll never guess who's out there buying up businesses.

[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:46.540]
What way?

[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:48.540]
What way do you think it's moving into Las Vegas?

[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.200]
The Gotti family.

[01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:51.980]
No.

[01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:53.420]
Goes south.

[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:55.260]
Not Wayne Hypinga.

[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:55.840]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:58.160]
Wayne is buying up stuff in Vegas?

[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:01.300]
Auto dealerships and waste management companies.

[01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:02.880]
Oh, my God.

[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:05.360]
Well, we'll have to look for a new place to go, I guess.

[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:07.420]
Used to be a fun joint.

[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:07.920]
Why not?

[01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:09.360]
I'm going to use them as a contact.

[01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:09.920]
Get comp.

[01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:10.660]
Yeah.

[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:11.360]
There you go.

[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:11.560]
Yeah.

[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:12.300]
He'll give you a comp.

[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:17.020]
Remember the end of what was that movie where James Kong was in the...

[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:18.500]
James Woods was in the...

[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:19.900]
What's upon a time in America?

[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:20.520]
Oh, yeah.

[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.900]
He was in the garbage truck at the end.

[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:22.280]
Yeah.

[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:25.020]
I'll wind up with some hacked up hooker and some...

[01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:25.480]
Rude side.

[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:26.520]
Wind up a problem.

[01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:27.500]
Old did head.

[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:28.000]
That's right.

[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:29.080]
Unbelievable.

[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:31.300]
So you'd like that one.

[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:33.580]
So when's the deal going to be finalized?

[01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:34.560]
When's he making the deal?

[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:35.000]
I don't know.

[01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:37.800]
They called me and asked me to check on her from this end.

[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:41.680]
You know, that they had heard out there, that they had been seen out there.

[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:44.840]
And was seen in the company of Steve Wynn.

[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:45.480]
Yeah.

[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:47.700]
And that he was looking to acquire...

[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:47.900]
Oh, no, no.

[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:50.560]
By the way, if he's acquiring auto dealerships out there, that's...

[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:50.620]
Yeah.

[01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:52.200]
...that's something different from what he's been doing in other states.

[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:54.240]
Well, maybe the good news is that means he's getting out of here.

[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:54.940]
Wouldn't that be great?

[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:55.880]
Not a...

[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:56.700]
He doesn't do it.

[01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:58.980]
Oh, you mean he moved the family out west?

[01:46:59.200 --> 01:46:59.400]
Why?

[01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:01.240]
So who gets...

[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:01.600]
Oh, my God.

[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:03.000]
You finally gave us a ray of hope.

[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.120]
He's going to move pick up the whole damn thing, move out there.

[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:05.580]
He's going to...

[01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:07.060]
Because we know he wants to unload the Panthers.

[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:08.980]
He's already got the Marlon deal basically done.

[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:12.480]
He gets rid of the Panthers and then the Dolphins be after that.

[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:13.780]
No, he keeps the Dolphins.

[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:18.020]
But maybe he could leave the Panthangeles behind, you know, just to look after.

[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:19.000]
Frank, he's Panthangeles.

[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:19.380]
There you go.

[01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:20.700]
He's small potatoes, just like Wayne.

[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:22.000]
Okay.

[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:23.340]
Thanks for the good news, Hank.

[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:23.720]
All right.

[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:24.520]
Okay.

[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:26.500]
And thanks, by the way, for pointing me the hell out of our pizza lot,

[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:27.500]
and we did a great job.

[01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:28.660]
We had a beautiful turnoff.

[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:29.240]
Yeah, I'm going to do it.

[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:29.660]

[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:31.660]
Hank's coming up next, and then we got...

[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:32.040]
What do we got?

[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:35.140]
The Booster at 6, and we got the Big Ball game that I should be one way

[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:37.760]
out of a pitching series, Sandiego, Atlanta 745.

[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:39.380]
You are on a hot summer day.

[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:42.160]
Me and the Mrs. Always Stop the Dickens.

[01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:43.340]
Dickens Fruit State.

[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.360]
They've got everything from fruit to vegetables, homemade pies.

[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:50.020]
But there is nothing like their cider.

[01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:51.280]
They can't ride honey.

[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:51.880]
Uh-huh.

[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:53.220]
Dickens cider.

[01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:54.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:57.040]
Why, even though we were late for church last Sunday,

[01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:59.760]
she had to have a little dick inside her.

[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:02.420]
She says there ain't nothing like it.

[01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:06.000]
Even my minister says his wife enjoys a little dick inside her.

[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:10.160]
Hey, why don't you bring some home and our protective plastic rib bottle?

[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:11.460]
That way you'll stay fresh.

[01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:15.640]
Or you can let it sit awhile and have some hard dick inside her.

[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:16.180]
Hard.

[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:22.400]
It's good at lunch, good at dinner, and there's nothing like waking up with a dick inside her.

[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:23.580]
Dickens Fruit State.

[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:26.540]
Just to our fruit 9W and country road 69.

[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:27.400]
Open 24.

[01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:30.700]
Because after a chillish summer night,

[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:34.600]
I like to snuggle up in bed with a dick inside.

[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:35.560]
We bring.

[01:48:37.820 --> 01:48:40.380]
Well, this morning with our ball popped out of there.

[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:44.380]
I didn't use this, but it's one of my weaverisms like a wet water melon seed.

[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:45.620]
Oh, I like them in high speed.

[01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:48.940]
We had Rick weaver on speed during the little warm-up session here before.

[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:50.740]
And he was a hell of a lot better, too, by the way.

[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:51.500]
And a running box.

[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:52.120]
There you go.

[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:53.280]
I'm turning the cracks in the big hole.

[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:54.440]
Ha ha ha ha.

[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:55.060]
All right.

[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:57.720]
Hey, listen, if you were as old as this car machine,

[01:48:57.720 --> 01:48:59.520]
you'd be having a little bit of a technical problem, too.

[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:00.600]
Okay, it's one of those things.

[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:02.420]
Nothing we can do about it.

[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:07.940]
I've got a story about the Amandal bread murders that's going to be coming up in a minute or two.

[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:10.940]
Oh, yeah, you've heard similar stories on this show on the past,

[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:14.280]
but this one that takes the cake, if I can use that expression.

[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:17.480]
By the way, I want to go back in my word, which wouldn't be the first time,

[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:19.960]
because I always reserve that option in the case things change.

[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:23.340]
Yesterday, I said I would never mention Manny, whatever, unless you're...

[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:24.040]
He's an asshole.

[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.600]
Over at Whammy and that whole business again.

[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:28.240]
I just want to say this for the ten people at my watch that show.

[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:34.000]
The reason you're seeing old rehashed reruns is because that's what they're putting on,

[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:37.500]
because Manny Lushum has decided that we're not going to put on the stuff,

[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:41.820]
because we've got these Amsterdam postcards that I've got on my cat that I'm wearing on my head right now.

[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:45.360]
That's already been on the air, by the way, many, many times, with the joints,

[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:47.320]
and the one that's stuck up here on a mic stand.

[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:49.520]
So being a hard ass and also...

[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:50.200]
He's an asshole.

[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:53.300]
He, and of course having no conversation with me whatsoever.

[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:55.640]
We tried, we put in a call to him two days ago.

[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:57.520]
Rob Kaplan stood right here.

[01:49:57.780 --> 01:49:58.560]
We dialed up the number.

[01:49:58.680 --> 01:49:59.280]
We got the station.

[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:00.320]
We got Whammy on the phone.

[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:03.000]
And did he ever call us back?

[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:03.280]
No.

[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:04.140]
Did he call me at home?

[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:04.420]
No.

[01:50:04.540 --> 01:50:05.340]
Did he call me this morning?

[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:09.160]
Has there been any discussion with Mia with any of the operational on people over there about this?

[01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:09.360]
No.

[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:11.460]
Did they care about the near-large and needle at night on Whammy?

[01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:11.620]
No.

[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:14.520]
Obviously not, because they're just still willing,

[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:17.220]
because of him being a hard ass, about what I don't know.

[01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:18.640]
What is the big issue here?

[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:19.260]
Has he told us?

[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:19.500]
No.

[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:21.020]
Has he told me anything?

[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:21.360]
No.

[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:24.880]
But they're willing because they just don't care.

[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:26.860]
They just don't give a crap.

[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:28.220]
Which is the Florida way.

[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:28.960]
How do you like that?

[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:29.980]
We don't give a crap.

[01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:32.420]
We don't care if we put a recent show on,

[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:34.020]
an old show or show from one to years ago,

[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:35.720]
because we're going to blow that thing out anyway.

[01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:37.840]
So I just thought I'd mention that to you.

[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:39.760]
So if you're wondering how come you're scratching your head

[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:42.160]
and you're wondering how come you're not seeing on a Whammy show,

[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:44.040]
the stuff that we're talking about here in the radio,

[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:45.280]
that's the reason why.

[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:45.940]
Good morning.

[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:48.080]
Get my Newsweek magazine in the mail yesterday.

[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:49.240]
This is always comforting.

[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:52.560]
When you buy your magazine in the mail and it says,

[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:55.920]
the crash of 99, the crash of 99.

[01:50:56.100 --> 01:50:56.480]
Oh my God.

[01:50:56.580 --> 01:50:57.020]
In black.

[01:50:57.680 --> 01:50:59.240]
On the front cover of this week's Newsweek,

[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:02.600]
economy at risk and Japan took a big overnight.

[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:06.200]
And the European markets are taking a big right now.

[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:07.680]
And the Dow is down 111.

[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:09.400]
And the NASDAQ is down 63.

[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:12.280]
All you drecking tech stocks for, you got real problems.

[01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:13.860]
And what are they doing today?

[01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:15.740]
The House is going to be voting on whether she's

[01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:16.560]
to proceed with them.

[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:17.100]
Peachment hearings.

[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:17.780]
There you go.

[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:20.300]
That's what we're worried about is blow jobs at the White House.

[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:23.560]
The world economy is going to hell on a hand basket.

[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:25.760]
And what is the United States government worried about?

[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:28.780]
The Congress is worried about blow jobs in a White House

[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:30.060]
and people don't want to talk about it.

[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:31.940]
And don't think it's a good idea for it to leak out.

[01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:33.960]
Everybody's like, Scorch-Corch and it up.

[01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:36.260]
Get a gigantic colostomy bag for the Congress

[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:39.700]
because they've got a real serious leak.

[01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:40.860]
Scorch-Corch problem.

[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:42.300]
Maybe you want to send you an Allison up there.

[01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:44.360]
She could be doing a business handover wrist.

[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:48.720]
Oh, and also Ray Reki before I get into my

[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:50.940]
Mondle bread story, which is going to take a couple of minutes.

[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:55.240]
Ray Reki, and I didn't even know he listened to this show

[01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:57.640]
because Ray Reki, to me, is, you know, not a bad guy.

[01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:58.280]
He's just boring.

[01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:00.500]
He writes this real terminal column in the Sunsendle.

[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:04.080]
Usually about his kid went off to school, very parochial,

[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:04.700]
very Yahoo.

[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:06.280]
Something he might read in the candidate

[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:07.400]
when messenger newspaper.

[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:10.340]
I always see what, but I always see what,

[01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:13.520]
the columnists are writing about just in case

[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:14.960]
there might be something of interest there

[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:16.360]
or something that they're ripping off for me,

[01:52:16.420 --> 01:52:17.820]
which in this case, he is.

[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.440]
Right out of this show, almost verbatim word for word.

[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:21.380]
Nice going, Ray.

[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:21.880]

[01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:24.620]
Bad name is hurt, but fists don't, he says.

[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:26.240]
Let me get this straight.

[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:27.800]
If you're a player in the National Hockey League,

[01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:29.860]
it's all right to put your opponent's shirt up over his head,

[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:32.880]
rendering him defenseless, then pummeling with your fists.

[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:36.140]
In fact, it's almost expected if players didn't regularly fight

[01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:37.900]
punch-kick, scratch, and gouge one another,

[01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:41.120]
attendance at NHL Games and doubtfully would take a severe punch.

[01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:44.660]
But if a player insults an opponent's race or national origin,

[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:45.900]
everybody comes outraged.

[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:47.680]
What's that about, he says?

[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:51.080]
Have we become so politically correct that we're now mentally deficient?

[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:52.960]
Has common sense really become that uncommon?

[01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:54.360]
I'm afraid so, Ray.

[01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:56.740]
I'm not going to read the rest of the yoke,

[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.580]
but I got an excellent point, which is the one I made yesterday.

[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:03.000]
And the day before, and that is you got hockey players

[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.840]
who are out there doing life threatening,

[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:07.680]
and in some cases damaging injury to each other.

[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:11.840]
I have a continuing diminishing respect for each other's physical safety.

[01:53:13.540 --> 01:53:15.300]
And nobody does anything about that.

[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.940]
They talk a good game, they're going to do something,

[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:17.960]
but they don't really think about that.

[01:53:18.300 --> 01:53:19.460]
And then this Peter Whirl incident,

[01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:21.500]
which they continue making a big thing about it,

[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:24.740]
he's Darcy Tucker from Tampa,

[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:26.660]
spent 20 minutes on the phone with him the other day,

[01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:28.320]
saying, I never said any of those things,

[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:29.900]
and Will Rell said, I know you didn't.

[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:30.620]
I didn't hear anything.

[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:33.640]
And Peter Whirl does never problem with this,

[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:35.520]
but they want to make another big song in a dance

[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:37.520]
because it's politically correct.

[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:39.420]
He's, he called him a, uh,

[01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:41.840]
and he called him a, yeah, right.

[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:43.180]
Oh, yeah.

[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:45.620]
And of course, the fact that he might have speared him in the head

[01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:47.080]
or poked an eye out or something like that.

[01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:48.980]
Well, don't worry about that, that's part of the game.

[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:50.240]
That's okay, right?

[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:50.800]
Yeah!

[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:52.280]
That's right, makes you more macho.

[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:54.980]
Let me do the break.

[01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:55.980]
But correction, okay?

[01:53:55.980 --> 01:53:57.260]
You do believe it, essentially,

[01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:00.480]
because I'm so out of whack, I'm whacked out.

[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:01.780]
I'm out of balance.

[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.280]
So thanks a lot, Mon,

[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:05.620]
the monologue bread was great.

[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:06.360]
Oh, yeah.

[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:08.760]
Don't ever do that again.

[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:10.820]
Can you believe that?

[01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:11.800]
Yeah, you can believe it.

[01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:15.260]
And of course, there would be a lot of the niles,

[01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:17.020]
but you do understand that subconsciously,

[01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:19.200]
there are people trying to make sure that you stay fat.

[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:20.600]
This has been going on my whole life.

[01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:23.660]
There are people who want to make sure you stay fat and sick.

[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:26.640]
And it goes on, and it goes on,

[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:27.520]
just like yesterday.

[01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:29.720]
Jeff Cohen comes in here with 5,000 pounds of food.

[01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:31.760]
Didn't I say I'm not eating anything because I'm going to go out

[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:32.860]
of my mother's for lunch today?

[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:34.900]
What was that food doing in here yesterday?

[01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:36.040]
And I told him not to be pregnant.

[01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:39.400]
Didn't we pack that place on Tuesday night and make him a lot of money?

[01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:42.360]
And have a way, and didn't he sit there at the table with our gold thing?

[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:45.220]
And coherently talking about the fact that during the summertime,

[01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:46.040]
I was the only one,

[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:47.840]
and the only time his business was slow,

[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:49.160]
was the seven months I was off the year.

[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:51.560]
Didn't he go on a great length about that?

[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:53.680]
But I've made this man tons of money.

[01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:56.620]
I'm talking about this for years on a year,

[01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:58.200]
and people, oh gee, here he goes on this again.

[01:54:58.440 --> 01:54:59.060]
But you know something?

[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:01.160]
It's a matter of trying to stay alive.

[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:02.000]
And it's not easy.

[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:04.620]
It's almost impossible to stay alive,

[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:07.080]
because they've got all these people out there trying to kill me.

[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:10.980]
With kindness, with sugar, with vandal bread.

[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:18.000]
You have to be certifiable to give a bottle of booze to an alcoholic,

[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:19.200]
and this is no different.

[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:20.520]
No different.

[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:28.020]
There are people on death row for crimes less than giving a big container of pure sugar,

[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:28.900]
or whatever it is.

[01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:32.200]
Cookies, cakes, vandal bread, pies, pastries,

[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:35.980]
to a diabetic, a compulsive sugar eater,

[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:40.000]
who's now sitting here watching that number,

[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:41.740]
they're out of control.

[01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:42.360]
There it goes.

[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:44.480]
Yeah, oh, geez.

[01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:45.320]
Oh!

[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:46.980]
Oh!

[01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:48.480]
Oh!

[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:50.160]
Oh!

[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:50.240]

[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:51.120]

[01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:51.780]
Oh!

[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:52.220]
Oh!

[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:53.760]
Oh!

[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:56.700]
I'm hanging on by a thread.

[01:55:58.600 --> 01:55:59.000]
Jesus!

[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:01.960]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6.

[01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:03.580]
Out of these natives today or not, do you think so?

[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:03.880]
No!

[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:04.840]
Probably not, that's okay.

[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:07.100]
If you're like you're spending too much money on...

[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:09.400]
I've got the college game of the year, right here!

[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:13.060]
It's UM against Florida State, live from the Ornville.

[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:18.380]
Game starts at 3.30, right here on sports radio, 5.60, QAM.

[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:20.960]
I got out of here, the whole new year of crimes.

[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:21.920]
Fun.

[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:22.520]
Yes, sir.

[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:25.480]
You know, you're obviously a very intelligent man,

[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:28.440]
but the problem that I think that's going on is partially

[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:31.240]
that you're not exercising to burn off some of that sugar.

[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:34.720]
You can eat some of that food, but why do you want to kill yourself like this?

[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:37.020]
The exercise, I understand what you're saying.

[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:38.760]
Exorcism has got nothing to do with your blood sugar.

[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:39.480]
Not that fast.

[01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:41.800]
Once you get all that sugar in your system,

[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:44.260]
your blood sugar starts soaring when you're diabetic.

[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:45.980]
All right, but you start to sooing up.

[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.420]
You're not listening to what I just said.

[01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:49.980]
You can't touch that.

[01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:51.540]
You cannot put it in your mouth.

[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:54.600]
I understand that part, but what is the obsession

[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:56.000]
of wanting to kill yourself, though?

[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:56.840]
I don't.

[01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:57.460]
What you do.

[01:56:58.180 --> 01:57:00.100]
You're eating that fish food and everything else.

[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:01.460]
That's right. Good point.

[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:04.300]
So the fact that matter is, I mean, it looks like you want to commit suicide.

[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:08.180]
Do you think it's a psychological thing that I really have a death wish?

[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:09.060]
Do you think that could be it?

[01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:11.260]
Personally, I like you a lot, you know that.

[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:12.760]
But over the years, I know that.

[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:13.480]
That's what you've been doing.

[01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:17.720]
You really, you know, maybe it's time you start seeking help in a way.

[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:21.100]
What do you suggest you do it yourself every day?

[01:57:21.260 --> 01:57:21.620]
You go on.

[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:21.940]
Kill myself.

[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:22.820]
Kill myself.

[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:23.600]

[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:24.920]
You kidneys have to be killing.

[01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:25.700]
You sowed as your liver.

[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:27.020]
What's your liver function reading?

[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:29.380]
All my tests are great.

[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:29.960]
Really?

[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:30.400]
Yeah.

[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:31.420]
Your cholesterol level?

[01:57:31.580 --> 01:57:32.080]
What's that reading?

[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:32.880]
206.

[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:33.560]
Really?

[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:36.200]
And then that's from the Atkins that you, you know.

[01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:37.920]
What, my cholesterol?

[01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:38.600]
Yes, that's it.

[01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:39.420]
No, it's from the Pravicle.

[01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:40.480]
I'm taking to keep it down.

[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:42.260]
Well, I mean, look what you're doing yourself.

[01:57:42.260 --> 01:57:43.480]
You're taking so many pills.

[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:43.740]
Right.

[01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:44.500]
All this crazy stuff.

[01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:45.360]
Pills from my blood pressure.

[01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:46.260]
Pills from my blood sugar.

[01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:47.540]
Pills from my cholesterol, right?

[01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:49.520]
I mean, don't you think it's time to get your back home?

[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:49.880]

[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:51.660]
No, I think it's time to start changing your regime.

[01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:53.400]
I mean, it's not your regime?

[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:53.880]
Yeah.

[01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:55.740]
The way you're going right now, this is...

[01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:57.280]
Well, no, no, no, I understand what you're saying.

[01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:59.700]
And I do a lot of my own picking out on my own.

[01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:03.080]
But I guarantee you, I'd probably weigh at least 20 pounds less.

[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:05.240]
And I'm not trying to blame anybody else.

[01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:09.400]
But I'd probably weigh 20 pounds less if it weren't for the unwanted stuff that I'm allergic to

[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:11.740]
that I just pick out on that people stick in front of my pussy.

[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:12.500]
But you have more...

[01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:12.980]
I bet.

[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:13.940]
I have no willpower.

[01:58:14.140 --> 01:58:15.520]
Fat people don't have willpower.

[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:15.940]
None.

[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:16.780]
We don't.

[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:19.140]
I was once fat too, but most of us have to, you know,

[01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:23.900]
your body fat alone is higher than the average person because of the fact that you don't move around a lot.

[01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:25.540]
My body fat is...

[01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:26.660]
You can't even count that high.

[01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:28.020]
They don't have numbers that astronomical.

[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:30.440]
So why not try something different for you?

[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:30.620]
Right.

[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:31.720]
Such as...

[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:34.200]
How about trying to walk around the block a couple of times?

[01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:35.300]
I mean, start somewhere.

[01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:36.500]
Walk around the block?

[01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:38.620]
Yeah, try something for your cardiovascular.

[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:39.800]
You need help.

[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:40.660]
Okay, I'm going to start.

[01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:43.280]
All right, look, I mean, make a lot out of the block right now.

[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:43.660]
I'm going to start.

[01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:45.000]
No, I'm sure I just got through Sam.

[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:45.880]
I'm going to do it right now.

[01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:47.280]
Look, no, you're a very nice guy.

[01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:49.280]
Nobody would like to see you go just a good way.

[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:49.380]
Sure they would.

[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:52.300]
They would love to see me cook right here on the year we get a 90's year with that.

[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:52.560]
Neil.

[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:55.820]
That Maddie Lesher would probably put that on the day in Miami again.

[01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:58.140]
This town wouldn't know what to do without you.

[01:58:58.220 --> 01:58:58.840]
You know that.

[01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:03.180]
I mean, it's sad to say this, but I think really you need to start seeing somebody regarding this problem.

[01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:03.980]
I need serious help.

[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:05.320]
You're getting worse, man.

[01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:06.020]
You're right.

[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:06.600]
Bye bye, Neil.

[01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:07.240]
Thank you so much.

[01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:08.820]
Okay, I need serious help.

[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:10.000]
I'm raising my hand.

[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:13.460]
Is there anybody out there willing to help a man who's star is killing himself with sugar?

[01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:13.720]
No.

[01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:14.180]
And start.

[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:14.440]

[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:14.620]
No.

[01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:14.840]
And food.

[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:15.020]
No.

[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:17.960]
Karen Carpenter killed herself with no food.

[01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:20.700]
I'm killing myself with all the wrong food with too much crap.

[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:26.380]
In fact, when he stick me in the ground and put on the tombstone, they can just put a eight too much crap.

[01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:27.080]
That's it.

[01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:28.160]
Right there on the tombstone.

[01:59:28.580 --> 01:59:29.820]
He was killed with...

[01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:30.480]
I wanted it.

[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:31.860]
No, not that.

[01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:32.560]
He was killed.

[01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:32.780]

[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:33.340]
That's right.

[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:40.160]
We have an open line that's been powered to and date 56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:42.380]
I mean, he got was very nice, very concerned.

[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:45.240]
And it sounds very simplistic, doesn't it?

[01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:45.960]
Do you know how many fat?

[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:48.940]
The number of fat people in this country is increasing by the minute.

[01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:51.240]
The low fat...

[01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:52.140]
scam.

[01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:53.300]
Total scam.

[01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:56.360]
Fatter and fatter and fatter.

[01:59:56.560 --> 02:00:00.820]
And the fact is that like I said yesterday, which I know it's a boring topic, but it's a truth.

[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:04.480]
Sugar and the starch are killers for millions of people.

[02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:05.560]
You can't touch them.

[02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:06.580]
You can't eat them.

[02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:11.000]
Did I go there with the empty do I ever eat dessert in my mother's house?

[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:11.280]
No.

[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:12.800]
Do I ever ask for cakes or...

[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:14.860]
Nobody cooks better this stuff than my mother in the world.

[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:16.720]
But do I ever want it or do I ever touch it?

[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:16.840]

[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:18.000]
Do I ever dance? Of course not.

[02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:21.880]
And now because my good friend Cheryl was there in an outplayment her,

[02:00:22.760 --> 02:00:25.860]
don't go blame in her, but of course because she was there, that wasn't excuse.

[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:29.960]
Let's whip out the old sugar and start cooking up like a storm, making a bunch of crap.

[02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:31.340]
Making up a bunch of crap.

[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:37.280]
Was there any doubt in anyone's mind that I would eat most of that on a way home?

[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:37.500]
No.

[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:40.760]
There was no... when she gave it to me, there was no doubt in my mind.

[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:43.780]
Way back in the recesses of what used to be my brain.

[02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:48.400]
Here's a call from Homestead. Hello.

[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:49.720]
Oh.

[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:50.280]
Yes sir.

[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:52.380]
Something wrong with the phone when I called in.

[02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:53.560]
Okay call me back. Call us back.

[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:55.200]
Yara phone, you know something?

[02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:58.560]
We're getting dicked in Dave County on his phone says I'm telling you about right now.

[02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:01.920]
We got a crappy phone system to begin with and somebody with Bell South.

[02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:05.500]
I'm going to tell you right now we're going to bring in Shilok Holmes and everybody.

[02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:07.320]
Ross P. Row, Colombo.

[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:10.360]
We're going to have a major investigation what's going on with our phone lines here.

[02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:12.620]
Somebody's dicking with our phone system here.

[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:15.880]
We said here yesterday and watched those three day lines simultaneously.

[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:17.940]
Remember that? All at the same time.

[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:19.860]
Is there any chance that that's possible?

[02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:20.120]
No.

[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:20.640]
Of course not.

[02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:24.180]
Just click they all just vanished at the same time.

[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:26.720]
People get in cut off because somebody's dicking with our day lines.

[02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:30.780]
Or maybe the whole goddamn phone system but especially the day line.

[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:31.860]
You're not fooling us, okay?

[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:35.000]
Probably my good friend Larry and Mixon over there, Bell South knows something about this.

[02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:39.340]
5667-0560, 05-560 on the AT&T line.

[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:42.420]
All the day lines are open as usual but I don't want to blame the audience for that.

[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:44.380]
See this is the game that they like to get you into.

[02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:46.580]
But guess what?

[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:47.700]
We're having a deep pressure man.

[02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:50.400]
I'm going to come in every single day and take that big fat paycheck

[02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:52.960]
because cash is where it's at.

[02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:54.100]
Let's see if it's any better.

[02:01:54.220 --> 02:01:54.480]
You back?

[02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:55.200]
Hey Neil.

[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:55.860]
That's better.

[02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:57.540]
Yeah, some funny happened didn't it?

[02:01:57.600 --> 02:01:59.180]
Yeah, somebody's dicking with our day lines.

[02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:01.260]
Okay, I'll give it a dick insider.

[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:02.400]
Listen.

[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:04.700]
I'm one that's been on interest.

[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:05.520]
Full crap, yeah.

[02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:06.600]
Yeah, it's full crap.

[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:07.160]
Sorry.

[02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:11.880]
The point is, I've been on this program for over three years.

[02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:14.500]
I still crave sugar.

[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:20.300]
But I tried to make my son, I had a friend that died about 30 years young.

[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:21.100]
You died?

[02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:21.380]
You died?

[02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:26.680]
Yeah, you died from drinking booze and it made me aware of my health and my blood sugar

[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:28.220]
was 300 when we checked it.

[02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:28.940]
Jesus.

[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:31.720]
My blood pressure was up to 200 plus.

[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:36.180]
And I got any act in the program, blood sugar slowly got down.

[02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:38.180]
Now it's normal for the last two years.

[02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:38.700]
What is it?

[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:42.200]
For me, I can't see it works for everybody because nothing works for everybody.

[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:44.100]
It works for me and I can't do it.

[02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:46.060]
I had the same thing, listen, believe me.

[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:49.420]
What I had to do was discipline my cell handful and that's what it means.

[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:51.820]
The stashios and the shell and I just eat them.

[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:57.080]
I found out that if I just stay away from all the sweet people who don't have these cravings

[02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:59.640]
and these problems and these additions, they can't relate to it.

[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:01.520]
And this is just silly, these people are weak.

[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:06.280]
It's an addiction, it's no different from alcoholism or drugs or any other damn addiction.

[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:11.000]
You're on the bone, I listen, the other thing is I've stayed on and I found out that my cravings have decreased.

[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:11.640]
I still have.

[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:12.300]
Yeah.

[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:14.700]
Periodically, I have to go on a whipped cream done.

[02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:16.580]
I hate it when you talk about allergy and it has a secret.

[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:18.580]
You got to get that out of your mind.

[02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:19.660]
You honestly got to.

[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:20.200]
I know that.

[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:24.300]
I think I got to go back and see my friend Bertann and get hypnotized again.

[02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:25.840]
Don't taste it, don't taste it.

[02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:27.300]
He's doing great, I saved his life.

[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:28.960]
I saved his life.

[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:32.300]
I saved the announced landing ladies life, which we don't hear from her anymore by the way.

[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:34.320]
Saved her life, she told us that.

[02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:34.960]
She was great.

[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:36.680]
She did the last couple times I saw her.

[02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:39.180]
But I can't save my own life.

[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:42.760]
I'm like the scientist who comes up with this great cure that cures the right.
