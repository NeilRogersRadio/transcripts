[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]
He doesn't like cocaine just likes the way it smells

[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:11.020]
Snort and a balls of tyros rolling up a 20 snort and a ball and he's

[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.600]
Gave them good and plenty they lick the 20 dollar bills

[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.780]
Their teeth are grinding like a peppermills

[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.380]
Goin' a balls out the home and pills

[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.720]
He's in the sky

[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.740]
Steve how is in the bullpen? His nostrils are wide open

[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.100]
He's so f**king up he thinks he's on the braves

[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.160]
He gets advice from Doc and Doc prescribed some rock

[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.260]
So first he blew a line and then he blew the safe

[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.660]
Snort and a balls they abuse the magic powder snort and a balls

[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.120]
Wrinkler lit a mechlam chowder

[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.700]
Prescriptions got perpetual refill

[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.440]
They do it in the pool if they had gills

[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.980]
Doin' a balls out the home and pills

[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.960]
All that money

[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.180]
A balls out the home and pills

[00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.380]
I like to welcome you all aboard

[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.560]
This is your manager

[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.980]
I love

[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.160]
27 before I was worried before one at 560 WQMC

[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.700]
And then his lost their mind over there

[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.740]
They're absolutely out of their mind

[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.720]
They're showing our live version TV

[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.480]
And then they got the guy they were about to meet

[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.740]
And like maybe out of 40 seconds later

[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.960]
They got an interpreter coming on

[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.720]
And they're saying they're having his phone

[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.440]
Celebration of the centennial of something

[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.960]
Of John Linden or Vladimir Lennon or whatever

[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.940]
And seeing that just showing his crap

[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.560]
Are you people out of your mind or what?

[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.040]
God are you people crazy?

[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]
Here's the hyaluria

[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.440]
Hello?

[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.640]
Yeah Neil

[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.120]
Yes sir

[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.680]
I was watching a show last night

[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.940]
And they cut to a commercial right

[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.800]
And then they showed

[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.000]
Do you remember when Laura Meager came to you?

[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.500]
I know they showed the same crap again

[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.420]
And then they showed you and they put your purse right quick

[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.520]
And then they were like

[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.600]
Get that guy out of here

[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.960]
You know when you were telling her?

[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.200]
Yeah

[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.000]
Yeah well I just wanted to tell you

[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.900]
You know that good luck to you and to George

[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.420]
And I'm going to school on Monday

[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.120]
And I'm all missed you guys

[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.900]
All right good luck pal

[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.440]
All right man

[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.000]
I'll read it out here

[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.580]
Okay yeah all the parks we go back to school on Monday

[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.080]
We wish you guys the best of luck and like I said, get a Sony Walkman

[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.520]
Keep listening to this show it's the only place you'll hear the God damn truth

[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.780]
We have two open lines and day one and Broward

[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.360]
I'm not giving no more Marlon tickets away

[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.000]
There's too much of an exercise today

[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.920]
There's some people in town

[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.600]
There's five or ten people in this town

[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.620]
This is too difficult

[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.580]
This is much too difficult

[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.840]
That's the strain and squeeze and plead and beg and cajole

[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.080]
And this guy that went on about the Covenants Well

[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.600]
That was unbelievable

[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.340]
Don't I want to go to the Andes?

[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.720]
For what?

[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.820]
I need to go see Ande Griffin

[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.680]
Much less to go to the Andes mountains

[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.760]
Come on they have lamas

[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.680]
Good good I'll go see the Dalai Lama

[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.780]
Okay get out of here you crazy bastard

[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.600]
You know I want to go to the Andes mountains

[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.820]
Don't you understand cut it off at Mexico

[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.260]
And let the rest of it just sink off into the South Pole somewhere

[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.220]
Because Latin America to me I'm very bitterly disappointing

[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.840]
Who in our right mind would want to visit there

[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.460]
And I realize some of you are from those countries

[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.140]
And just be glad you got out

[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.720]
Okay I mean at least we got a lot of good strip shopping centers anyway

[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.120]
Dead counties wide open

[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.740]
That's that's where all those people are friend by the way in Dead County

[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.660]
All those illegal aliens 5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.640]
Palm 5 60 on the mobile one line

[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.940]
Isn't that where the illegal aliens go to Dead County

[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.580]
That's the American fucking way

[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.920]
Right

[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.960]
Here's a mobile in Boca

[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.480]
Hello

[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.660]
Yes sir I can't believe I actually got you

[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.140]
I haven't been in a country for more than a year in the old

[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.180]
So that's time I heard you

[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.960]
You were leaving that other station

[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.820]
Good to hear you on this station

[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.840]
I'm glad to hear your actions the same

[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.800]
The reason I called is to tell you about the most fantastic city in the world

[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.040]
Yeah

[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.120]
Barcelona

[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.940]
Spent almost the year there

[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.980]
And about a couple of months in Prague

[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.120]
Of course lots of stops and you know where Amsterdam

[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.440]
There you go

[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.980]
Well he what he said was kind of like

[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:13.560]
For example

[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.280]
Only he said Madrid instead of Tampa

[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.080]
That's what he said

[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.160]
Right that's what he said

[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.860]
Okay thank you

[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.780]
You first maybe that's why he had such a good time there

[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.240]
We have two open lines in day one and

[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.220]
Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.320]
Palm 5 60 on the mobile one line

[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.640]
There's a guy in love with Barcelona

[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.440]
I don't think so

[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.380]
I'm then told the different things

[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.160]
No matter what you listen to

[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.240]
If you want to check out a place if you like traveling a world

[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.540]
You got to go there yourself

[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.540]
Because you talk to 50 people

[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.480]
And 25 of them tell you one story

[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.220]
And 20 of them tell you another story

[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.760]
And the other five are so stolen out of their mind

[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.380]
You don't even know what story they're telling

[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.060]
And they don't either

[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.920]
You got to go yourself

[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.080]
You got to try new things

[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.620]
Like the guy with his spaghetti sauce says

[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.000]
You got to try new things

[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.240]
23 to 1 at 5 60 WQM

[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.360]
Where we got a brief taste of the Hank Goldberg show today from 2 to 3

[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.080]
Where we got 50 billion hours of pre-game activity

[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.340]
From 3 to 70 before the dolphins in the packers

[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.700]
We're at 7 o'clock tonight

[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.140]
If you go 5 60 QAM

[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.400]
Where you fudge back them

[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.480]
I'm here to believe I've got you

[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.600]
I'm a thousand smells

[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.120]
Running out of TV

[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.120]
Just don't stand in my way

[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.380]
Because never got to go

[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.120]
Now we're on meant to where you come from

[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.300]
Haven't eaten a thing for two whole days

[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.240]
I tried white rice and chicken broth

[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.460]
But nothing seems to work

[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.320]
My head for all these is swollen

[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.060]
To feel like they're playing

[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.440]
I think I've lost them on my colon

[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.680]
And I'm ready to go by

[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.300]
It's gone depends

[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.240]
Because I have tried

[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.100]
And money and still have time

[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.740]
We are all lost

[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.380]
I've got the wrong

[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.560]
Yes, I tried to kill the tape

[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.000]
But it's too late

[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.040]
Oh, this version bastard man

[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.580]
I just want to mark it was making nice comeback

[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.480]
The Dow was down only 26 points

[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.720]
And now they show a taped interview with Yeltsin on there

[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.640]
On Russian TV, first thing out of his mouth was

[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.960]
I mean this guy looks pie-eyed right now

[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.300]
He's had at least two points of vodka before he started speaking

[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.140]
And then the most important thing he said

[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.860]
Is I will not resign yet yet yet

[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.420]
And then he said

[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.960]
And that was sitting on the market down 49 and dropping like a rock again

[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.240]
We were just starting to make a nice little comeback

[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.200]
Everybody's assuming he's going to step down

[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.220]
And somebody who maybe has some of their mental facilities

[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.940]
Still working might step in there

[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.540]
And he will not resign yet yet yet yet yet etc

[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.720]
And so on and another one of the

[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.780]
That's it

[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.560]
I'm talking to a man that God damn Truman

[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.220]
Everybody's talking about what a genius he was

[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.480]
It was that freaking Truman

[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.880]
Send his ass back to Missouri, send the box back there

[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.320]
Send best Truman and what that was his wife

[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.600]
That was best, what was his daughter Margaret

[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.720]
Send them all back there, they're God's in Mishbhaha

[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.940]
In a God damn big carton

[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.120]
Should have gone in there and put that American flag right there

[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.640]
Should have gone over to Minsk and put the flag over there

[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.720]
One in Siberia

[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.500]
And then we should have built a bridge between the Illusion Islands

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.880]
And the Siberia there, the American-American bridge, whatever the hell

[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.000]
And then move it out of the American way

[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.280]
And then we should have sent MacArthur back over there to Japan

[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.360]
That's right, got him out of the Philippines and sent him to Japan

[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.140]
And sent all Doug MacArthur in there about telling him what for

[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.300]
Stuck the American flag right in the middle of that God damn hero he was pushed

[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.220]
Right in his back home, there you go

[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.840]
And we wouldn't be in this pickle today having to worry about all these other

[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.980]
Guided and banana boat countries

[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.060]
That's what it's all about

[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.340]
That's why everybody's having a nervous breakdown and puking their guts out

[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.100]
Because we got a world where all these see if they didn't have the bomb

[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.460]
Then it would be a different story

[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.580]
Don't we just go over there and say hey Yeltsin you're going to resign or not

[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.840]
He says, yeah okay here you go, here's one for you Boris

[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:36.840]

[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.420]
What am I talking about?

[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.380]
Here's a lady mobile in Hollywood, hello

[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.080]
Hi Neil, how are you doing?

[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.400]
Okay

[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.600]
You know that lady called in or somebody said you have said that

[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.120]
You got to really go to the place

[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.740]
At the people talking back

[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.580]
You got to find out for yourself because other people have different taste

[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.620]
Some people are very bad taste

[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.280]
I got to tell you everyone I talked to I just got back from Fancy Cisco

[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:00.700]
Yeah

[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.920]
Everyone I talked to said you're going to love it you're not going to want to come back

[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.540]
And you know what? They were right

[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.360]
From where San Francisco

[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:09.580]
Hello

[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.380]
I'm listening from San Francisco

[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.480]
Yeah well then I did the monoraxing and I went down to Big Sur

[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.760]
Too, so that was really

[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.980]
I haven't been there in so many years I wouldn't even recognize it

[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.220]
I have no idea what it's like now

[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.460]
Oh well I almost couldn't make it back

[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.460]
Because the road heading back north to Big Sur to get to the airport was demolished again

[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:27.980]
Yeah

[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.360]
Every few months there

[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.120]
But guess what I did while I was out there

[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.500]
And this was not pre-planned it was just kind of a coincidence

[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.300]
The mountains were playing the giants

[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.060]
So I went to the game

[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.100]
You know my bar

[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:45.180]
The Marlin's in the giants you went to that awful candlestick street comp park whatever they're calling it these days

[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.180]
The three com

[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.320]
Oh god

[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.600]
Well that's the one Friday night two weeks ago we lost 10 to 0

[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.940]
So I was feeling like a real fool

[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.760]
Well if you go out to San Francisco if you go anywhere why would you go to see the Marlin game?

[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.020]
Because I thought it was a novel thing

[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.520]
There would be like my going to Roman going to the racetrack

[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.680]
But then last one

[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.680]
The problem is still one at five sixty WQM

[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.980]
Now if you do want to win a pair of Marlin tickets

[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.360]
And she ain't good again by the way

[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.840]
Make sure she don't get them Joe

[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.720]
Big caller number nine right now on a contest line

[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.260]
A winner pair of Marlin's tickets for the Dodge Big Mac Zone whatever we're calling it there

[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.700]
I wish I had that promo from yesterday but I don't

[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.200]
Because Sam of course don't want to be overwork

[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.560]
In the club level and left field there

[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.940]
You get out there might have a chance to catch the big one at markets

[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.020]
And maybe you just catch cold

[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.800]
Who knows what you're going to catch you'll catch something

[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.960]
And I'd call her to our contest line at 1-800-227-0560

[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.520]
227-560

[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.640]
And make sure she don't get them or anybody it sounds like her or anybody that's related

[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.760]
That is some nerve isn't it is not unbelievable?

[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.240]
I mean if you're listening to the show and I'm making it very very clear how we're doing is

[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.240]
Oh I'll take the tickets

[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.800]
Yes stick them in your recto

[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.340]
Okay sweetheart

[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.700]
You're not the only one and the center back to San Francisco

[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.220]
That's not the point

[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.880]
The point is I'm making it as clear as possible

[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.900]
If you have an IQ smaller than your little toe you can still understand

[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.640]
Every time you do that all these lines light up people think they're calling to the tickets

[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.300]
What do you mean? They call here

[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.840]
Even though you give them that a number out

[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.040]
They do know they know they're all full

[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.720]
If these people are right now think they're coming

[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.920]
No wait a minute I'll find it

[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.600]
Do they already play?

[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.480]
Are you calling for the tickets?

[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.160]

[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.140]

And where everybody's got a brain and where they teach kids about sex

[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.180]
And they're really young so they don't become psychotic and frustrated and acts murder

And chewed each other in school and in teachers and their parents and everybody else

Uh there's no way to be here we work I work in a place that is close on itself faith on the core good one

[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.600]
The guys that work here they love your show uh-huh and they were telling me that you were talking about Venezuela

[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:19.520]
Yeah I know you're stopping and they happen to be from over there Venezuela blows at least

[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:25.160]
Caracas does I can't speak for the rest of it because I would never go there but I would say it's a banana

[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.980]
Republic but they would be an insult to bananas

[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.640]
Caracas you want to go out and move it terribly

[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:44.380]
Well I have been through I moved from Venezuela in 1979 because of the exactly because of the situation

[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:50.780]
But still has this charm it has the exotic part of that also from America has yeah

[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:58.040]
But unfortunately you got to be on the adventure mode and really kind of like to roughen it up

[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.660]
Oh yeah right

[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:04.040]
But it's not the if true it's you don't want to do it the word paramilitary keeps coming to my over and over again

[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.840]
Dangerous dangerous crowded psychotic backwater

[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.100]
All these guys standing around in the shirt and caracas hotel with their striped seizure or marrow suits on

[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.700]
Looking like something out of a Carmen Miranda movie from a hundred years ago it was incredible

[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.040]
Well but isn't that fun too?

[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:28.040]
No it's not my fun I got a vacation I want to go places where there's living and breathing people I feel like I might be safe

[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.160]
If I want to if I want to go somewhere I'm dangerous I'll just stay home

[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.280]
Oh yeah?

[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:32.820]
Yeah

[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:33.400]
No

[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.600]
Right here in Florida baby

[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.940]
But you know what you should go to Canaima

[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.060]
To where?

[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.080]
Canaima

[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.260]
Canaima

[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.580]
Cana degoa

[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:41.880]
No?

[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.160]
Is Canaima

[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.020]
Is it a place where it looks like a...

[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.520]
The girl from Ipa Canaima

[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.160]
Well it sounds close

[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.740]
I suppose close

[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.380]
I need where they have the tolerance waterfall in the water

[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.580]
Did they have a yarmulka if they have a yarmulka in the tallas on my halfway there

[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.920]
And some fillings and some cices

[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.340]
No no no no but you said no love it really

[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.340]
Well if lovers can't American by the way

[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.880]
If they have cices they probably have

[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.340]
And his name was Angel

[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.020]
And they were waterfall for Angel's fall

[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.420]
And his tolerance waterfall

[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.960]
I wish they were...

[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.180]
Tell me what do you think of Luis Miguel

[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.240]
Let's talk something important

[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.320]
Okay, yes I really do

[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.460]
How could you not love Luis Miguel?

[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.680]
And you see and he'll come from an exotic country

[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.480]
Mexico

[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.260]
Yeah

[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.280]
Yeah

[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.760]
That's an exotic country

[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.720]
That's even worse

[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.340]
That's even worse

[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.820]
I was just telling before about how the cab drivers kidnapped all the tourists

[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.840]
And take them on the middle

[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.900]
They are nowhere and they rob them blinded and maybe kill them if they're in the right mood

[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.020]
That's pretty exotic, you're right about that

[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.800]
All right well Neil

[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.600]
We are very...

[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.280]
Don't forget that you are very fond of you

[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:58.960]
You show if you happen to want a danger to come to Miami

[00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.660]
Yeah

[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.000]
And if you happen to me on Coral Way

[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.480]
Okay

[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.700]

[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:07.600]
What's the name of the store?

[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.960]
The name of the store is Sonny South Hainst of the Corps

[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.180]
We have found it in 1923

[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.080]
It has been around for a while and they were locked to see you

[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.780]
I'll be right over

[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.460]

[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.340]
Bye-bye

[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:19.960]
Okay, bye

[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.520]

Oh, I love this

[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.540]
I don't like it

[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.060]
I love it

[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:32.700]
Boy

[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:40.220]

[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.340]
I love it

[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.960]
We got another two cars

[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.700]
I think I like it

[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:44.920]
How many?

[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.040]
I think it's two

[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.400]
I think it's two

[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.540]
Have you ever been to St.

[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:51.800]
What about talking before?

[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.900]
I'm just...

[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:56.220]
My balls are ready to explode just from here in that crap that this guy was spewing

[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:56.980]
Of course, what do you want?

[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:57.880]
He went to the shit at El

[00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.280]
We have an...

[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.440]
That's how Brian Murray would say it

[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.100]
Open line and date one and powered 5.6705.60

[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.320]
Pound 5.60 on a prestigious AT&T wireless line

[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.800]
It's eight minutes after one on your dolphin intensive station

[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.880]
Don't forget now stay right here on 5.60

[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.880]
Because Greg Reed wants to make sure you don't go anywhere else

[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.940]
Because the dolphin game no TV of course it's blacked out

[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:19.580]
Are you out of your mind?

[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.800]
There's only one place to hear it

[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.480]
Unless you want to hear it in some foreign language from some barbaric country

[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.420]
And that of course is right here on 5.60 QAM

[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.240]
Because next we want those numbers

[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.300]
We want the spots we want the numbers we're desperately clinging to this

[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.560]
Because we've heard that morning show

[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.160]
You know when you're looking to make your...

[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.400]
Everybody's people today's show is brought to you by Larry's latex and leather

[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.280]
Home of the vibrating melon

[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.120]
Ooh, and now back to our show

[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.360]

[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.620]
We're me and my friend Kimberly talking the radio about our favorite movie

[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.440]
Titanic and Leo

[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.860]
I love you Leo

[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.120]
Yeah, we talk about the most beautiful thing in Titanic

[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.200]
Leonardo DiCaprio

[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.540]
I love you Leo

[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.620]
I know, I love Leo too

[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.240]
Well today's topic is the Titanic

[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.540]
I saw Saturday for the 14th time

[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.480]
And I cried

[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.380]
I've seen it 17 times

[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.360]
I cried every time

[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.640]
I wanted Leo to live this time

[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.200]
I wish my boyfriend was more like Leo

[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.560]
I wish my boyfriend was Leo

[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.340]
Oh my god, look at the clock

[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.520]
Titanic starts at the mall in 15 minutes

[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.440]
Let's hurry

[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.880]
Well, then Leo, we're coming!

[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.500]
Okay, thanks for listening

[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.720]

[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.160]
When our topic will be Leo

[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.320]
Rock, Leo

[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.480]
That damn baggot I can't stand it

[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.860]
Okay, 114 at 560 WQAM

[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.140]
We have an open line in day one in part

[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.360]
Have we got two up here to give away for two days out of the left or what?

[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:50.780]
Oh, one

[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:51.760]
Two I believe, don't we?

[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:52.500]

[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:55.620]
Okay

[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.620]
Two, let me spot...

[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.080]
So anyway, I didn't say I was giving away one right now, but I might

[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.040]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.000]
Oh, you people are shameless, you know

[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.160]
I'll avoid the light and by the way, speaking of giveaways, during the break

[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.580]
Did I... Did he really say that?

[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.560]
That putt-wacking Sam the scam

[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.160]
Who happens to be from Venezuela?

[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.400]
You see, that country once upon a time was really not so bad, I guess

[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.220]
And then Sam came into the picture

[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.720]
And all of a sudden everybody said

[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.080]
Oh!

[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.200]
And that's the end of this place

[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.760]
The fact that he's from Venezuela, I guess, either as an excuse for why he's such a

[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.980]
putt-wacker and so useless or maybe it's some other reason, I don't know what it is, but he is just

[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.520]
He's having a meeting by the way to, they were themselves about to be a center one thing

[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.860]
Gonna be able to make that, Georgia?

[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.520]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.280]
He's having me, we're in here last night, we got all the stuff put together

[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.040]
Georgia's over there meeting with the CD people, they're gonna take care of that

[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.680]
LeWance taking care of the wholesale thing

[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.640]
And here's our promotion guy, he's gonna be sitting in on a meeting

[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.520]
Talking in that very pedantic style of his like, how are you, how do you do, etc.

[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.160]
And what do I do, nothing, nada

[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.700]
He likes that song, nada as you go by LeWance only the in-out of part is what he can relate to as in-out of thing

[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.560]
Which is what he does

[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.640]
Where we go, let's go to a mobile in Miami, hello

[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.200]
Hello, Neil?

[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:08.660]
Yes, sir

[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.120]
Love your show, don't want free anything

[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.580]
We don't got anything

[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.480]
All we listen to the show, we'll want to reason for you, nothing that sports things

[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.000]
One request on a Friday

[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:19.520]
Yeah

[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.080]
Little old man named Irving

[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.800]
Little man, you mean, little old man named Irving

[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.780]
From the people who've watched you a big black guy named Ben

[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.360]
What is that called again by the way?

[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.620]
Oh the eyes and not Irving

[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.920]
Oh I'm sorry, I guess it

[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.840]
One thing hopefully for the cloud machine

[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.660]
To go, stay away from the fish food, UMF

[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:40.280]
Okay

[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:45.280]
While spending the remainder of your golden years in the land of death

[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.620]
The one thing you have to depend on is your car

[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.940]
With Duke and Newcept on the rise

[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.440]
The people who brought you a big black guy named Ben Car alarm

[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:58.420]
Now bring you an old Jewish guy named Eisen

[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.820]
Get away from my port of a bill

[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.400]
You thinking, MF

[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.380]
Remember when we used to post a packet of carabee in Jada

[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.260]
If we ought to get a bundle of fish maybe

[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.520]
To wipe what's cooler

[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.400]
Get away from my port of a bill

[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.820]
You thinking, MF

[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.940]
What the hell is that?

[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.800]
I object seriously

[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.080]
To profanity like that

[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.160]
I think somebody's got it

[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.360]
Get away from my port of a bill

[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.400]
You thinking, MF

[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.420]
Get away from my port of a bill

[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.860]
You thinking, MF

[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.800]
Whenever some bastard tries to steer my car

[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.820]
I feel safer with an old Jewish guy named Eisen

[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.240]
Get away from my port of a bill

[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.760]
You thinking, MF

[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.200]
Get your old Jewish guy named Eisen car alarm now

[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.620]
And receive a free flower antenna

[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:56.820]
Get away from my port of a bill

[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.880]
You thinking, MF

[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.260]
An old Jewish guy named Eisen car alarm

[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.720]
Now available at all their stores

[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.480]
Okay, the 700 color of the car identified

[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.440]
The thing is this one, the money's birthday, the money's shoe size

[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.520]
We want to know exactly how big she is

[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.400]
What does it look like?

[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:18.660]
Cormaniana

[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.820]
Horsekin or no?

[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.200]
Cormaniana

[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.740]
The 2700 color to call right now identify this guy

[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.720]
It's our best wishes

[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.700]
It's Louis Vucile

[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.860]
Can I make you no shit?

[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.020]
Where's the rest?

[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.320]
Where did you fall off range of my company?

[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.440]
Where did you fall off range of my company?

[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:49.820]
I'm down

[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:55.080]
Okay, let's do it right now, okay, because I forget about this

[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:55.940]
That's not

[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:57.740]
Okay, let's go to way

[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.240]
I don't want to play teas with this audience

[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.700]
Today, run to the phone, it's going to start getting them exasperated

[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:02.980]
And why not?

[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.860]
I should not get them exasperated, they've been doing it to me for over 22 years

[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.760]
Okay, let's give away a pair for two then I write now

[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.040]
What do you think?

[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:18.780]
Here's that toll free number, 1-800-227-0560

[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.620]
Color number nine, right now, right now gets nothing

[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.320]
Okay, here's a mobile, no, we're not doing it now, I'm going to do it in a few minutes

[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.360]
Here's a mobile import waterdale, huh?

[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.760]
Hey, good afternoon, Neil

[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:29.160]
Yes, sir

[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:34.980]
Hey, from what I've heard and been told there, there is a safe delay on TV as it came an hour later

[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:37.220]
You mean the dolphin game?

[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.440]
Yeah, the dolphin game

[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.720]
Yeah, but we want to see that

[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:45.340]
That would be like listening to it on WACC, like we had last week and hear a 7-second delay while you're trying to listen to the radio

[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.940]
Yeah, my hey, I have a great story about an old Jewish guy named Eisen

[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.320]
Yeah, but while I was waiting, he brought up Mexico

[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:58.040]
I went there about six years ago and friends of mine went to another one to go surfing

[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.940]
and they went to another break and they hired a cab driver

[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.100]
What a coincidence on the way to the other place

[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:08.180]
They all got robbed, took their money, didn't hurt anyone, but the cab driver

[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.320]
His money was never found

[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.580]
What a coincidence, right

[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:13.880]
No insides there

[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.740]
Okay, but I'm a local roofer here in Broward

[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:21.080]
And we're doing an old Jewish guy named Eisen's roofer today

[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.400]
I told him yesterday to let him know we were coming

[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.920]
And I told him that we had a big black guy named Ben as our foreman

[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:32.280]
And that he'd protect cars on the side and I thought it was just kind of funny that guy had to request that

[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.680]
How do you like that? He must be psychic

[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.080]
Yeah, let's be

[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:42.580]
But anyway, is there any way I could get you to play any of the little Clinton, you know, Melody?

[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.380]
Like what?

[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.420]
Requests, oh God

[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.620]
I guess you have a few there, the few strong

[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.740]
How about, I want you to listen to me

[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.420]
I do have sexual relations with Miss Luansky

[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.260]
And I told that woman to lie

[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.500]
There's a dress that has some stains

[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.960]
Preseason with a Friday night showdown against the NFC Champion Green that was at Pro Player

[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.300]
Countdown the kickoff starts at three

[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.980]
The game starts at seven

[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:12.320]
Yeah!

[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.360]
Sports Radio 560, Q-A-N

[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.420]
What's your question?

[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:25.160]
So this picture's a big trouble model for New York, Linda

[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.320]
A wreck

[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.820]
I can see what was here

[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.060]
Grand jury investigating

[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.160]
And guess where she shot this team heart

[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.800]
She looks like a guy

[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.860]
Hey, more stuff

[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.500]
She's seven feet wide

[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.340]
She makes me want to cook a shrine

[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:45.580]
Countdown the kickoff starts at three

[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.140]
A kick with a f***

[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.680]
With two smelly skins

[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.800]
A blow to the glee

[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.360]
Uploaded and ugly fat pig

[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.160]
Countdown the kickoff

[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.440]
She wants the media to stop the fusing

[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.200]
And Ritping her and ask with songs like this

[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.600]
But we find that amusing

[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:13.040]
From that self-promoting ugly pig

[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.280]
How much were you paying?

[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.140]
How much were you paying?

[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.860]
Formaticus pay?

[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:22.660]
Formaticus pay?

[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.420]
By retreats the melons pay?

[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:30.020]
That's what's good, Linda, Linda, Linda, Linda, the tricks of fancy

[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.380]
I wish you all would leave me alone

[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.720]
I'll just make it when I feel out there

[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.780]
I know you'll be beaten

[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.140]
Maybe I'll know so far from you

[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.160]
Just who do you think you're fooling?

[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.160]
You bad-of-talk is ugly smelly pig

[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.940]
You're really mad, drugs in a dress

[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:57.360]
And you know me

[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.020]
It's a classic

[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.680]
Okay, she's got big trouble

[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:07.280]
I just had a flash on CNN that the grand jury that's investigating her is talking to the people at K-Mart

[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.840]
She should listen to Dustin Hoffman

[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.880]
Who told her that K-Mart sucks, she wouldn't listen

[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.920]
The law in Maryland about wiretapping is this

[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.880]
That if you tape a phone conversation without notifying the other party, it is definitely in violation of the law

[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.300]
Unless you're ignorant of the law

[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.280]
However, the employees of K-Mart were in the bottom of her wiretapping device

[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.580]
Say that they routinely notify all customers

[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:30.360]
And they definitely did notify her that if you do wiretapping without the other persons are consent and knowledge that it's against the law

[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.120]
So that big fat Linda's got big fat problems now

[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:34.900]
All right

[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.020]
While she's going to need somebody to take care of her son while she's in the slimer

[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.480]
Here's Miami, hello

[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.800]
Neil, how are you?

[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:43.400]
Pretty good, sir

[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.360]
And they're here in the George breaking in with during the bit

[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.280]
Sure, I'm holding

[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.460]
In fact, you mentioned that because yesterday he said some of the most disgusting stuff

[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.140]
And I'm sure he was forgetting that people could hear it

[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.080]
Yeah, well that's okay

[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.020]
I just want to say something about the...

[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.100]
I think he said something like Bobby Hall is God and I don't even know who he is

[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:01.620]
But anyway

[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.920]
I mentioned one thing about your wonderful promotion department

[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.260]
Yeah

[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.500]
You're having a promotion tonight down on Quail Rouge Drive

[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.300]
It's a piece of hut

[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.540]
Way down south

Because what difference is there?

[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.220]
What if Joe opened the door

[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.480]
Come on, you can open that door

[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:45.960]

[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.160]

i heard that voice and i just want to scream i mean he just got the greatest voice

[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.860]

a smart person well come on how can you say that

[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:49.240]
no well because he's so many of the reason i've been

[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.080]
it's bothers

[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.740]
you put on this father's name instead of sitting there

[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.500]
instead of sitting there based on how good of a thing or he is

[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:59.160]
he's a very well it was a little bit of his he's got music all it that's

[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.400]
out all over the world including Italy spain everywhere

[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.600]
and if people didn't like the way he's saying it didn't like his music no

[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.840]
matter how popular his father was they wouldn't buy it

[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.320]

twenty three till two at five sixty wqm the hammer will be your hand gober

[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.640]
from two to three just for every flower today just a little cameo appearance

[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.260]
well if i were hank i'd be ported off that to come in for just for an hour

[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.680]
well there's two ways to look at it

[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.420]
i mean number one you say you know you got to come all the way over here and

[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:33.060]
come in for an hour

[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:36.040]
and of course to go into that building for hours like risking and danger in your

[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:36.260]
health

[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.820]
but on the other hand come in for just an hour saying okay see you

[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:41.520]
is not that bad either so it all depends on which way you'd be looking at it

[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.780]
depending on how much free food's waiting

[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.980]
hey listen right now you might want to write these numbers down for a

[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.440]

[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.440]

[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.420]
professional from a kid into a teenager you better hurry up and i take it to

[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:17.320]

through we understand you went a lot of pressure it's the last day the kids are

[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.040]

[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.200]

here's North Miami hello hello yes sir yes Neil he just mentioned the bird

[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.640]

[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.060]
yeah what have we gonna ever see the two of them together

[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.480]
my god you know you know something that's an insult to the bird i mean i

[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.760]
see that the bird was annoying but nevertheless the bird at least in his own

[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.560]
peculiar way could be on the ear and act like he belonged on your guilty doesn't

[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.580]
belong on your just to say hello okay well you know what i mean you know the thing i was

[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.720]
listening this morning and they were doing this contrived controversy you know with Hank

[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:41.540]
and Andy and and i'm listening to that and i'm thinking the thing that bothers me the most

[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:45.460]
is that guilty thinks that we're kidding and i can't speak for Hank but i think i don't

[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:48.880]
hang pretty well when Hank is telling you that he's a little putz and will always be a little

[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:53.160]
putz i think Hank really means that and when i tell you that i know i really mean it because he's

[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:58.080]
a little no nothing but who is shrill and talks loud and kisses a lot of ass and shills a lot and

[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.960]
doesn't know what he's talking about well you know how you say you know you you have a face for

[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:07.260]
radio aren't you supposed to have a voice for radio oh not here i mean between that when

[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:10.800]
they put the board ops here on this station as long as you work cheap man it's unbelievable

[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.880]
as long as block takes a shine to any work cheap well you're in in this joint it's a shame because

[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:20.680]
i'm a sports fan but every time between goldie and uh having uh uh joe rose singing uh

[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:25.620]
whatever around the clock around the client i turn the radio off yeah a couple other things uh

[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:32.440]
well i'm glad you enjoy their show oh we we we we we we yeah only in the state of florida do we

[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:38.520]
uh get to choose between a jib bush and a buddy mcay i like the we we yeah shouldn't jib

[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:43.120]
belong to mcay shouldn't that name belong to mcay and maybe a buddy bush buddy bush wouldn't be bad

[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.480]
me about that show do i dare to talk to see i was gonna say anything i was gonna try to be a nice guy

[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:09.280]
because their numbers are sagging badly and they need some help from all of us but everything is

[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.780]
so contrived didn't they ever hear mr ego that can try controversy on the life of it went over

[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:19.020]
like hollivite in the middle of bay route it just doesn't make it okay and uh they just it's so

[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:25.000]
contrived and corny and like sparring and jabbing and poking and jamming and uh you know who cares
