[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]
So, it's the QA cap.

[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:02.900]
Yes, buddy.

[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.640]
Come on!

[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.320]
A backwards roof.

[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.920]
Now, Jeb represents the Christian Reich,

[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.740]
but somehow got support from the Jewish journal Kikes.

[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.300]
Now, they're all in a mass grave, very, very deep,

[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.000]
and his wife wears a necklace of the fillings from their tea.

[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.320]
Jewish gold melted down, of course.

[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.020]
The Tallahassee Millionaires.

[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.020]
Starring Heinrich Himmler as Jeb Bush.

[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.480]
Ava Braun as Kolumba.

[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.160]
Ariana Huffington as Greedy.

[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.440]
And Dan Burton as General Bertels Air.

[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.620]
But Tallahassee Millionaires brought to you by Zagon Hague.

[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.900]
I can't wait for that Jewish journal article to come out.

[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.540]
I think it's next week it's coming out about Hitler was misunderstood as a youth.

[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.840]
26 before 11 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.300]
So anyway, yesterday I'd go home from this joint after a just unbelievably depressing day,

[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.560]
but then again, lately they all been like that, so what's a big deal?

[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.440]
And I called up and the record in the middle of the show again,

[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.520]
we had our sales manager, Skruan Winnick, who walks in here.

[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.700]
And she's got a letter from the FFA, which is the future fifth truth of America,

[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.580]
or whatever that stands for, the Florida Family Association,

[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.960]
which used to be the American Family Association.

[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.260]
But then they got to kind of cut off and they were like in bankruptcy.

[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.440]
And then they finally got their few dozen members back together again,

[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.200]
starting sending out their newsletters full of crap.

[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.080]
They're going to get Howard off the air, they're going to get Near Rogers off the air,

[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.640]
they're going to get everybody off the air, they got anybody off the air yet,

[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.260]
they're going to get all the sponsors to cancel.

[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.300]
So at any rate, over at the other station, since they were well used to dealing with this kind of stuff from the FFA,

[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.520]
and other people as well, there was really any state of panic.

[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.560]
There was some concern, they sent out letters, and then of course we had announcements,

[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.180]
which we used to run periodically, saying that all the material on broadcast on the radio station

[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.860]
was copyright, and any unauthorized reproduction et cetera,

[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.440]
and dissemination of tapes was strictly prohibited by law,

[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.680]
which stopped them from sending out these damn tapes,

[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.660]
which they butcher up and they chop together, and make it sound like this is a pornographic radio show,

[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.500]
which it is not.

[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.820]
These are those good Christians again over there in Tampa, David Katenen is crowd, the FFA,

[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.860]
who have decided who just taken it upon themselves to decide that they are the centers for the state of the census,

[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.780]
for the state of Florida, and maybe the entire country if they can get away with it.

[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.820]
They're going to decide what you can listen to, what can be on the air,

[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.860]
what can't be on the air et cetera, and so on, like that good Christian lady

[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.240]
that called a couple of weeks ago, that tells me I'm going to be off the air by the end of the year.

[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.060]
I guess what, honey?

[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.500]
Wrong.

[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.860]
So it integrates grand comes in here, and she says she's got a copy of a transcript

[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.820]
that they've sent out to some of our sponsors, which our sponsors all through the years on all the stations

[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.100]
have always supplied us with copies of these things and say,

[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.800]
we told them to go to hell or with you in the waste basket or whatever, and don't worry about it.

[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.840]
Because most of our sponsors are local and they understand this show,

[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.440]
and they know exactly what this FFA is all about, where they're coming from.

[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.680]
SCUAN win a color of her comes in here during a break in the middle of my very depressing show yesterday

[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.120]
after I've already had a tolerate Gary Sarner in his unacceptable behavior,

[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.920]
and she says to me,

[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.120]
oh, what are we going to do? The sponsors are canceling left and right.

[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.360]
That's a direct quote. We're getting cancellations left and right,

[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.320]
because the FFA, the future, I got it back,

[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.640]
where the future fist, screws of America, almost did that, screwed up.

[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.500]
Have been sending these letters out, you know, a lot of context,

[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.840]
and getting everybody nervous about advertising on your show,

[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.880]
which is a game that's been going on, let me say it again for years.

[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.900]
So needless to say, since it's only my livelihood that's at stake,

[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.620]
and I'm starting to think to myself, maybe these people aren't competent,

[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.680]
maybe they aren't apt, you've heard of the word inept,

[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.520]
well, there must be word F, maybe they aren't apt enough to a combat and deal with this problem,

[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.000]
since they don't know often about it.

[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.920]
Since the rest of the time, they don't have very much controversial stuff on here,

[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.600]
since it's a sports station.

[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.860]
And it's okay for the jocks to go on and say all the words,

[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.800]
and of course you've heard them all, and you know,

[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.280]
it's a separate deal, managed, can say,

[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.300]
and these other guys can say whatever they want, that's okay, it's a sports deal.

[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.920]
And it's not pornographic, because those are Marcho Sportsguys,

[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.840]
not some Jew atheist fag sitting on a radio being pottymouthed.

[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.180]
So I made a call yesterday to this radio station,

[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.760]
which is quite an experience in itself.

[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.920]
I make the call, some guy answers the phone.

[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.440]
I said, Greg Reed, please, he said who's calling, I said, Neil Rogers.

[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.560]
Okay, one moment, please.

[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.580]
Puts me out, hold.

[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.620]
The next sound I hear is, hello.

[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.120]
And immediately as soon as I heard, hello.

[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.800]
I knew it was the water Nazi, it was Phyllis upstairs,

[00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.800]
which I've already given you 10 months ago,

[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.940]
I gave you the whole story about her.

[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.780]
I don't deal with her, she don't deal with me,

[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.780]
and we both like it that way.

[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.380]
Hello.

[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.080]
I said, yeah, I was waiting for Greg Reed.

[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.380]
Who is this?

[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.920]
I said, Neil.

[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.760]
Who?

[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.000]
Neil.

[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.200]
Oh.

[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.880]
Give me a number.

[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.940]
So of course, not expecting a return call,

[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.660]
which I did get about 25 minutes later,

[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.300]
which is very unusual for Greg Reed.

[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.300]
Not expecting a return call since we usually play cat and mouse,

[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.960]
and he likes to play the avoidance game.

[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.480]
I called SCURA and WINICK.

[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.800]
Our sales manager to find out what the LR real story was.

[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.920]
Are we really getting cancellations left and right?

[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.600]
And I get around the phone, but I'm eating,

[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.660]
but I'm open about, but maybe we ought to be sending...

[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.920]
See, our salespeople, even as inept as many of them,

[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.920]
have been bringing us copies of those letters,

[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.520]
and all this crap from the FFA,

[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.660]
the future fist of America, for a month now.

[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.720]
And I assume that if the sales manager wanted to do something in response,

[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.260]
like IOD used to do,

[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.240]
send a general letter out to the agency's

[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.420]
and all of our sponsors to let them know what this is all about,

[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.040]
and attempted censorship,

[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.140]
and total distortion of what the show is all about.

[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.600]
You know, sending a letter out.

[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.680]
I thought that maybe they might have already done this,

[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.680]
but now just at this point since SCURA says,

[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.240]
we're getting cancellations left there.

[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.200]
The sky is falling since SCURA.

[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.720]
Even though you hear all of these spots on this radio station,

[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.060]
including the show, I mean just spot after spot after spot.

[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.700]
The spots never ran on this station.

[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.080]
For example, you've heard some of the sclamors

[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.080]
by the other Toyota dealers.

[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.060]
They turned the volume way up, and they tell you the...

[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.320]
What are you looking at me for?

[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.020]
We've got another spot break to do here, baby.

[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.480]
Of course, the conversation with SCURA

[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.700]
and Winick, our sales manager, is like...

[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.440]
When you talk to her, it's like somebody who's saying goodbye before you finish saying hello.

[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.000]
Hey, how are you? Okay, see you later.

[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.500]
That's always the conversation, including the one on the telephone.

[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.500]
So about 10, 15 minutes later, my phone rings,

[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.760]
and there's Greg Reed returning my call.

[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.200]
Oh, my God.

[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.740]
Oh.

[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.460]
That's right. There he was.

[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.580]
Must have gotten the message from the Water Nazi upstairs.

[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.260]
Why do I call Philist to Water Nazi?

[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.520]
Because we have somebody on two different floors here,

[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.780]
while this construction is being finished,

[00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.060]
which is only taking about three years.

[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.560]
And so some of our salespeople down here

[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.060]
have like little plastic drinking cups,

[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.540]
and while they're sitting in there on the phone,

[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.360]
talking to their clients, doing whatever they're doing,

[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.580]
they like to have a little something to, you know,

[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.340]
with their whistle.

[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.140]
A little water.

[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.200]
Water in Florida?

[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.160]
Water in Florida. What a concept.

[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.260]
And so every time they go to get water,

[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.360]
they have to go upstairs on the third floor,

[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.420]
and we have a, you know, jugs.

[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.200]
Can I say jugs?

[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.060]
Some of the people upstairs got jugs.

[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.040]
Oh.

[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.120]
No, not her.

[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.120]
And of water, which I guess the company must pay for,

[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.100]
big, big bucks.

[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.460]
I don't think so.

[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.660]
And the new deal, well, the deal on long has been

[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.140]
that if any of our people go upstairs

[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.780]
and take more than a thimbleful at a time of water,

[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.480]
the Water Nazi, oh, yeah, that one,

[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.120]
she's like carrying on like it's coming out of her wallet,

[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.540]
coming out of her paycheck.

[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.640]
Bitching people out.

[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.640]
Isn't that what I ran and raved back in the January

[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.300]
about that scene out in the parking lot here?

[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.100]
With Gary Sarner, which was a match made in the heaven,

[00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:57.660]
by the way.

[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.040]
If I, and I know what I, then what I know now,

[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.840]
maybe I wouldn't have even been impressed by it,

[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.360]
I would just ignore it, because they deserve each other.

[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.540]
It's a match made in purgatory.

[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.660]
The Water Nazi.

[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.980]
Oh, don't take more than that.

[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.860]
This is a, this is major market radio.

[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.280]
This is a company that is supposed to be making money

[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.200]
in a major impact here.

[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.680]
This is your dolphin station.

[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.340]
This is the Neal Roger station.

[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.880]
This is the Hank Goldberg station.

[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.260]
This is your big highfalutin A and radio station

[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.460]
that even a little bit of water you take up there

[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.980]
and you have to put up with a bunch of crap,

[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.720]
a bunch of abuse and crap from the Water Nazi.

[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.560]
Don't take any more.

[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.460]
Things are getting really tight around here.

[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.740]
You bastard.

[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.820]
So anyway, Greg Reed returns my call.

[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.520]
And I mentioned him to him the conversation I had

[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.720]
with screw-in ourselves, manager.

[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.940]
He said, that's not true.

[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.220]
We have one cancellation.

[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.440]
And I already knew about that cancellation

[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.380]
and I'll tell you what the cancellation was, by the way.

[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.280]
I'll tell you right up front.

[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.680]
It's not a local or a regional account.

[00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.740]
It's an account that I didn't want to do in the first place.

[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.900]
That John Penis, whatever I see,

[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.760]
people just decided that I was going to endorse live

[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.700]
without asking me first.

[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.960]
The video professor, which I felt I had very ambivalent feelings about,

[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.900]
because it's one of those deals where they do give you something

[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.520]
basically for free in the beginning.

[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.560]
And then they start, you know, they keep bugging you

[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.460]
to buy a bunch of more stuff.

[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:15.960]
I knew what it was.

[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.320]
And I was like a medium-to-dition chanted about doing it.

[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.240]
But, you know, once it was already on there,

[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.620]
there was much I could say about it.

[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.620]
So they canceled because they got a letter from the FFA,

[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.580]
the Florida Fist Association,

[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.080]
or whatever the hell it stands for.

[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.220]
Yeah, they got their fist in each other's backgones

[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.360]
when they're doing over there in Tampa.

[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.960]
And so, a great retell is that that's a total absolute f-ing-wide.

[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.200]
That we haven't had a whole bunch of cancellations

[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.220]
and the sky is not falling.

[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.560]
And I come in this morning, I see we got so many spots.

[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.620]
If we had calls, which we don't have any,

[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.780]
but if we did have, we would have time for them anyway.

[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.800]
Because it's all spots radio,

[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.180]
we are completely totally sold out on this show.

[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.740]
Every avail, so anybody out there who thinks

[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.080]
that the new Roger Show is going up,

[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.000]
because a bunch of puttwhackers over in Tampa

[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.860]
are sending a bunch of twisted, distorted,

[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.560]
painful letters out to all our sponsors.

[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.360]
You're dreaming it ain't gonna happen, sweetheart.

[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.100]
All you people that are monitoring now,

[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.500]
and sitting down there wasting valuable time,

[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.920]
that you could be using helping somebody

[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.060]
who's like dying in a hospital,

[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.360]
or helping homeless people,

[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.560]
or whatever they might be doing,

[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.380]
something constructive,

[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.140]
which would be the good Christian thing to be doing.

[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.360]
But instead of that, they're out there monitoring

[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.340]
and they're writing down in a long hand,

[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.100]
and they're embellishing,

[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.340]
and they're, oh, because this is a,

[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.380]
and why is that?

[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.420]
Why do we have this Christian thing in America?

[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.100]
Because Christian in America,

[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.460]
including the Republican Party,

[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.040]
which has been taken over by a bunch of

[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.260]
lunatic right-wing Christians,

[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.960]
that stands for censorship.

[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.200]
That's what the C in Christian stands for,

[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.580]
censorship and control.

[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.820]
We will control you.

[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.000]
We'll tell you what you can say.

[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.500]
We'll tell you who can be on the ear,

[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.260]
and if they're to the left of Lord-Ass Limba

[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.380]
or to the right of Lord-Ass Limba,

[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.140]
you can't be on the ear,

[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.540]
and you can't be saying those things.

[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.600]
And certainly not saying those God-damn words.

[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.560]
You just can't do that.

[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:55.840]
Because we decided.

[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.360]
That's why.

[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.760]
I mean, forget about the First Amendment.

[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:58.660]
Forget about the FCC.

[00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.860]
Forget about anything.

[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.980]
Because we just decided we're a pissed off,

[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.840]
rather than fighting something else to do,

[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.980]
we have decided that you can't be on the ear.

[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:06.940]
How are you can't be on the ear?

[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.220]
Nobody else can be on the ear,

[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.560]
unless we give our stamp of approval.

[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.880]
And we're just going to try to terrorize

[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.040]
and bully you off the ear.

[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:13.780]
Well, ain't going to work.

[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.240]
It absolutely positively is not going to work.

[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.320]
And if I have to come in here and play music,

[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.020]
every God-damn day for the next four years,

[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:26.700]
guess what?

[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.360]
I'll do it.

[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.020]
Because this happens every single time

[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:31.740]
that we're up against.

[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.200]
This is never one thing that you can

[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.840]
vet your life on in this town.

[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.540]
Every time you're up against it,

[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.260]
every time there are people

[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.240]
trying to get you off the ear,

[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.340]
and you'll need support.

[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.300]
This is what we get.

[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:40.820]
Look at the phone.

[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:41.460]
That's what you get.

[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.620]
We've had three weeks of coma here,

[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.600]
no matter what it is.

[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.760]
And I'm not going to waste my time today

[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.220]
talking about my patient or Lord-Ass Limba

[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:47.220]

[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.620]
or his tailor or about how good the lease looked last night

[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.520]
and how good the Nashville printers

[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.460]
and how I didn't see on Larry King last night

[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.020]
about how another photographer supposedly

[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.920]
sneaked in the house and the photographer did it,

[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.800]
which is the newest spinner try to put on the thing

[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.260]
to try to say mommy and daddy

[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.320]
certainly couldn't have done it.

[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.280]
Because the photographer sneaked in the house.

[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.460]
I've got 80 million things.

[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.500]
I could talk about that Mary Kaye.

[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.220]
What's her name?

[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.440]
LaTerno.

[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.980]
Over there in Washington state.

[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.540]
That's having her second baby by this 15 or 16-year-old kid

[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.140]
who looks like he just landed on the spaceship.

[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.760]
They had that story on last night.

[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.360]
Where in God's name did she find this creature?

[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.000]
This skinhead, this freak of nature.

[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.740]
Well, I think it's a match made in heaven.

[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.820]
And of course the best part is,

[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.740]
like I've always told you,

[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.820]
they're reproducing the best of good news.

[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.480]
And he's over in Paris now,

[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.280]
the 16 or 15-year-old father

[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.540]
of these two illegitimate kids,

[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.520]
who isn't doing his schoolteacher,

[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.020]
who just can't stop getting enough.

[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.360]
He's over in Paris with his lawyer

[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.340]
and they're writing a book.

[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.520]
They're making a book deal in Paris.

[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.240]
All right.

[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.260]
Because you know something?

[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.080]
That's the American fucking way.

[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:50.920]
Amen, baby.

[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:51.780]
You got it.

[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.660]
Just like Monica with her book deals and her movie deals,

[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.860]
she couldn't afford enough to go to the laundry with that dress.

[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.860]
She couldn't go to the dry cleaner to get the dress clean.

[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:00.940]
But now all of a sudden,

[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.540]
there's millions coming all over the place for Monica's story.

[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.940]
Maybe she might even show us evidence

[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.120]
of her presidential knee pads.

[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.180]
Maybe we could see those too.

[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.480]
So here we are.

[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.340]
And by the way, last night,

[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.280]
they had a great piece on NBC about why most people on campus,

[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.420]
most kids die on campus.

[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.900]
You know the cause of 95% of deaths on campus?

[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:22.620]
Binge drinking.

[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.520]
Booze, that's right.

[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:24.640]
Booze.

[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:25.640]
Not drugs.

[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:26.520]
Not marijuana.

[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:27.880]
Booze.

[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.840]
90% of rapes on campus,

[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.540]
connected with booze.

[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:33.720]
There you go.

[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.380]
Are we going to go back to prohibition?

[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:36.660]
No.

[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.660]
Did it work in the first time?

[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:37.940]
No.

[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.400]
But boy, you get caught with a few marriage-oenie plants, baby.

[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.220]
Refer madness.

[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.200]
That's what it's all about.

[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.020]
Don't ever forget it.

[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.360]
Don't ever forget that, Manny Lesherman.

[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.200]
Anybody else out there that's a hypocrite phone?

[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.820]
You got goody-two shoes about this issue,

[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.300]
which should be a non-issue in a country that civilized in advance

[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.560]
and beyond the kindergarten age?

[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.820]
That's about the maturity level of our government in this country.

[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.620]
Like, right about kindergarten, I would say.

[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.140]
Kind of like the people around here.

[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.200]
So, Sam, the sham,

[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.120]
let me just say this to you.

[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.960]
And this goes for several of the people in this building.

[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:08.400]
Okay.

[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.880]
I'll show up here every goddamn day

[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.560]
and take that paycheck every two weeks.

[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.400]
Whether we have any calls, no calls, any ratings, no ratings,

[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.540]
I'll continue showing up.

[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.700]
Do you want to rate me a check?

[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.640]
See, this isn't my doing.

[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.120]
It's not like some kind of plot that I've been doing.

[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.840]
I've been showing up here every day for 10 months,

[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:25.980]
doing the best I can.

[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.280]
Highest ratings on the station.

[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.720]
Highest spot rate on the station.

[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.300]
Sold out 16 minutes an hour.

[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.560]
Even though we agreed to 14.

[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.240]
Nevertheless,

[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.960]
so I'll continue showing up here every day.

[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.040]
But some of you people in here don't even waste your time crossing my path.

[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.260]
I don't have time in my life for liars,

[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.480]
BS artists, I don't deal with that.

[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.500]
Because like I've told you a million times

[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.440]
when you get to be my age and you've paid your dues,

[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.360]
you take as little as possible.

[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:51.760]
That's right.

[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.720]
That's part of my motto.

[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.040]
Do no harm is number one.

[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.040]
But take no, that's number two.

[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.700]
That's like not too far down the list.

[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.720]
That's right under DNH.

[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.660]
It's TNC.

[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.600]
Take no right.

[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.740]
And don't deal with assholes.

[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.960]
Don't deal with people who like everything you try to do.

[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.800]
And this center one thing.

[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.440]
And I'm sure that there are people around here, including people in the audience.

[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.440]
Oh, center one, you know, that's with people with AIDS.

[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.320]
That's a fact thing.

[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.460]
I hate to break the news to you.

[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.340]
Center one helps women, helps children, helps straight people,

[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.860]
gay people, bisexual people.

[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.060]
AIDS doesn't discriminate.

[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.920]
There are more heterosexual people getting AIDS now than homosexual people.

[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.520]
But don't confuse anybody with the facts.

[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.740]
It's not a gay organization.

[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.660]
It's an organization that helps people who are desperate with medication,

[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.360]
whatever they need.

[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.080]
And it's an organization that's a damn good one.

[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.040]
And it does a lot of great work.

[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.920]
And even if it weren't a good organization, it's still tax deductible.

[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.460]
It's a charitable donation.

[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.540]
And we got great stuff there on OCDs.

[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.780]
So Sam, the sham, maybe it's a big joke to you.

[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.080]
Since I still have a receipt, dollar one from anybody in this radio station for center one.

[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:52.860]
Not a penny.

[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.540]
I realize we still have two months and 10 days to go.

[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.800]
Not a dime.

[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.440]
And I remember back in the days when Camilla's house was our charity.

[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.200]
Remember that's what we got.

[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.380]
They got two uppity for us.

[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:09.100]
They didn't want those dolphin posters because we got a poster with three of the dolphins.

[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:09.860]
I forget who they were.

[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.140]
I think Mark Clayton was one of them.

[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.200]
And the dolphins did this because we were the dolphins stationed in IOD.

[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.060]
And number two, they wanted to help with our fundraiser for the Camilla's house.

[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.040]
And so three of the players got dressed up in cowboy uniforms.

[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.940]
They got on horses with shotguns.

[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.300]
Remember that?

[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.820]
And they made a poster.

[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:27.780]
It was a beautiful thing.

[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.540]
And we were selling those for 20 bucks or whatever.

[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.960]
It was to raise more money for Camilla's house.

[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.600]
And Camilla's house refused to allow us to sell those because they felt that the message was

[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.200]
these are three black guys and that black people are criminals that they're thugs.

[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.420]
They came out at the same time as that posse movie.

[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.820]
The all black cowboy movies.

[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.060]
Right.

[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:45.940]
Play of them now.

[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:46.500]
Oh yeah, but right.

[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.300]
That was the message.

[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.500]
But the message that they got was all black people are criminals and they all got guns and they're dangerous.

[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.140]
And therefore we don't want to be associated with it.

[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.620]
But back in the days when we did Camilla's house and raised probably over a million dollars for them.

[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.260]
I would say it easy for many, many years.

[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.080]
Back in those days, the mail, remember all the mail I used to come in every day?

[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.660]
Tons of envelopes of mail.

[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.680]
I'm not talking about people who were buying CDs or cassettes or one anything and return donations.

[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.500]
$100 here, $50 there.

[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.800]
That was for Camilla's house for the homeless.

[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.940]
And believe me, I still feel very strongly about the homeless.

[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.120]
I'm very sorry that Camilla's house didn't feel strongly about us.

[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.720]
That they're too good to take our money.

[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.400]
Those good catlicks over there at the center at the Camilla's house.

[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:30.120]
But since we changed the charity that we raised money and do this fundraiser for every year,

[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.640]
since it became setter one, do we get one of those checks?

[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:33.940]
No.

[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.820]
Do we get any mail with checks in the envelope?

[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.140]
No.

[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.460]
In the envelope? No.

[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.880]
All of those good, wonderful people that were helping us with their charitable donations.

[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.500]
All of a sudden they can't afford a dime.

[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.060]
They can't spare no change.

[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.680]
And that's where he said.

[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.040]
So I'm going to continue doing my fundraiser and do the best I can and show up at those appearances,

[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.280]
which I donate my time.

[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.780]
I don't take a penny for those deals.

[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.740]
And hope, like I said, hope to do the best.

[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.020]
But believe me, not expecting any assistance or any cooperation from in here.

[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.400]
Is Scrooan working on that border thing so we can get any up to date numbers?

[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:08.620]
No.

[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.720]
Is Sam the Sham doing anything besides making a joke out of this with his plastic stupid thing here?

[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.300]
With this $300,000 total?

[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:14.580]
No.

[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:14.760]

[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.560]
And I'll continue going on a record and exposing this place for exactly what it is,

[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.000]
until they start doing things like a goddamn fitter and one of the breaks he was down here

[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.040]
and I was reading them in the riot act.

[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.740]
He looked at me like somebody had just shot him in the brain if we could find one.

[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.640]
And George said, he doesn't speak that language.

[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.200]
He doesn't understand what you're saying to him.

[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.360]
He's never heard these things before.

[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.420]
And I said, oh.

[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.000]
1057 at five.

[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.820]

[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.340]
11 slangs.

[00:19:59.340 --> 00:19:59.340]

[00:19:59.340 --> 00:19:59.340]

[00:19:59.340 --> 00:19:59.340]

I am doodied,

[00:19:59.980 --> 00:19:59.980]

[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.860]
So here's how you play the game and when you play the game you are playing these games.

[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:02.860]

[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:02.860]

[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.160]
9 pickup.

[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.000]
in the apadre's game three as the anchis will close it out to more

[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.520]
Lawrence Taylor who battled drug addiction for more than a decade was charged

[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.280]
Monday with possession of crack after buying some from an undercover police

[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:19.480]
officer here we go again as much as cocaine is a horrendous substance here we

[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.940]
go one more time with that drug thing

[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.900]
little L.T. as they finally call him because every jocke has got to have a

[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.100]
nickname to endear him to everybody

[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.340]
the other hand he's uh... you know we're we're doing him all over the place

[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.440]
because he can't break his crack cocaine habit but i think it here's

[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.080]
Mike Tyson who raped a woman and was uh... you know in the slamer for it

[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.420]
for how many years he was in there not long enough

[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.480]
and try to bite the vendor holy fields you're off out there in Vegas we see

[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.240]
what what the Tyson thing is all about is one thing

[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.080]
money that's all it's all about

[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.020]
Vegas is falling on hard times which i told you last week which is very unusual

[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.460]
for their

[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.400]
but the agent economy has been the crapper

[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.220]
the u.s. economy everybody's been real nervous so the discretionary dollars

[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.380]
the people want to put their brains out and go gamble like crazy like we used

[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:03.500]
to

[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.880]
uh... not so many anymore

[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.400]
plus the competition from california the indian reservations and coming

[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.640]
from mexico they're surrounded all sides will actually name it

[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.000]
so big is got tremendous competition and even though they had grotesque

[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.820]
things take place at the mgm grant they had bottle throwing and the people get

[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.760]
in beat up all kinds of ugly stuff which are nearly never seen Vegas that's

[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.600]
the last thing that they want you to see

[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.080]
so even in spite of that the fact is that they know that they can put this

[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.780]
goon back in a ring fighting a chimpanzee if that's what has to be and still

[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.460]
make a fortune make millions of dollars that's what it's all about

[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:40.560]
and wasn't it heartwarming to see him surrounded by it was magical came

[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.540]
magic scuttle of the time his tv show was off

[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.980]
and it was Muhammad Ali Muhammad Ali should tell you everything about boxing

[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.740]
and how barbaric and stupid it is

[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.020]
just look at him

[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.620]
he's sitting there with his wife making a statement of course he can't read the

[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.460]
statement because he's sitting there shaking with his Parkinson's disease and

[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.460]
he's just looking off into space like a dead man in a suit and his wife reads

[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:04.180]
the statement and of course there's Mike Tyson saying oh I'm so so so so

[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.680]
sorry and I thought to myself say it again a couple more time so so so so

[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:13.360]
so so sorry you have no idea please don't torture me no more and they said okay

[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.100]
okay where's the money sweetheart so that's what that's all about

[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.400]
okay let's get to this plethora caller we got on the board now five six seven

[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.580]
oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line let's see if we

[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.520]

Beach hello forgive me dad for I have sin yeah hey Neil how's it going okay you

[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.380]
know it all goes back to your DNH thing you know and the people would just

[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.820]
understand that but the problem is people don't understand that so I don't know

[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.320]
why is it so hard to understand what's so difficult about that but see I

[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.340]
understand why can't people leave everybody else alone and if you want to listen

[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.860]
to something that's different or watch something that's different as long as

[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.720]
you're not harming anybody what the hell is it anybody's business or I understand it yeah yeah yeah

[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.620]
I understand it it's the other people that you don't understand it you know they

[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:06.400]
got to come up it's just like you said but the TV thing with Channel 4 and the and

[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.420]
the gate people and they show the way they're missing the missing flaming stereotypes right

[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.340]
it's ridiculous man I wish you know you probably wouldn't like it but I wish I

[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.640]
was your neighbor because man we get along great yeah I wouldn't bother you you

[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.120]

[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.520]
I don't I don't drink no sorry oh we'll need to do why but hey we could find

[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.160]
something together but anyways that thing I remember when you were on the other

[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.880]
station oh that station I hate and you used to get on and you would open up

[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.160]
letters and you would go here's one for 50 here's all we used and you know

[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.880]
something I went through that whole song and it answers now I got one other

[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.280]
call on the board and we're picked up where we left off yesterday these people

[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.080]
got nothing to say assuming there might be anybody listening out there and there

[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.280]
must be somebody listening because everywhere I go I go to public I'm out

[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.000]
there driving on highway people are high-fiving they're they're waving

[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.780]
there this to the so they're out there listening but the cats got their tongue on

[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.060]
any of this stuff they've got nothing to say about it yeah but you know I we've

[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.660]
gone into a whole new phase in Miami talk radio and the fact is that it's

[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.540]
vanished it just it doesn't exist anymore it's strictly one way talk I don't know

[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:11.280]
what happened but I know for days and months when you kicked up the campaign I

[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.340]
mean every day you had piles of envelope every week there were thousand

[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.840]
eight dollars coming in for Carlos on every week not only that you would say

[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.860]
thank you Jennifer because Jennifer we come in and give you something or or

[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.140]
this person or that person and I don't hear any of that crap over there they're

[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:29.180]
cheating you know you don't hear it because nobody here other than Ron from

our whammy staff and I think he's a great guy other than Ron we haven't got

[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.140]
I haven't gotten a dime from anybody I mean I'm not one penny from the QAM

[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.560]
staff from the management from anybody that works on this radio station and like

[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.800]
not I'm not part of this as George calls it the sports bar with a

[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:41.440]
from fruit to vegetables homemade pies but there is nothing like their cider

[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:47.320]

[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:53.220]

[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:02.760]
you bring some home and offer to your plastic rib bottle that way it'll stay fresh

[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:08.780]
or you can let it sit awhile and have some hard dick insider it's good it

[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:13.580]
looks good at dinner and there's nothing like waking up with a dick insider

[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:19.680]
dickens fruit stain just off root nine W and cut your road 69 open 24 hours

[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:25.220]
because after a chillish summer night I like to snuggle up in bed with a hot dick

[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:25.780]
inside

[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:33.620]
15 to 560 WQM thank God for that small dish by the way God almighty was at a great

[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.960]
game between Nashville of all teams the predators and the maple leafs last night

[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.620]
got a two two time but what a great game back and forth and up and down and

[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.020]
nonstop action and great goal tending it it was tremendous and then I watched

[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:51.940]
you know in between parts of that New England jets game I mean poorly played

[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.700]
poorly officiated the first jets touchdown if they still had replay

[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.560]
clearly not a touchdown a fumble before he reached the goal line but you know

[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.920]
just a really mediocre effort and the NFL's in big trouble the numbers of the

[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.240]
ratings are way down Monday night they're way down on the weekend and for good

[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.220]
reason because they're putting a crappy product out there but don't confuse some

[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.420]
of these people like the guy who called yesterday oh yeah a great time and give

[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.460]
credit where credit is due yeah okay we have an open line and Broward to and

[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.620]
day five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.140]
here's a payphone in a pompano hello yeah good morning Neil how are you doing okay

[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:28.600]
sir okay I might have our usual civilized in start yet and I don't know if you

[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:34.260]
get the USA today no I don't okay on the page there's a new book out pros and

[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:38.420]
cons the criminals who play in the NFL yeah a new book charge that more than

[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.800]
20% the pro football players are criminals whose path deeds are often ignored

[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.840]
or rationalized by their teams in the NFL and this guy called through some

[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.760]
statistics or whatever and just real quickly the sample group had been arrested

[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:57.620]
a combined 264 times so that's two times rape seven times domestic violence

[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:03.060]
45 times excuse me yeah I'm listening yeah and it just goes to show you know

[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.840]
it's just like what they're saying get the kids to root for watch out who they're

[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.980]
rooting for who than that jurors never see the adults though they don't care

[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.700]
about that stuff as long as the player it's like when they brought Lawrence

[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.080]
Phillips in here was nothing but a piece of walking turd and people were

[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.940]
saying oh Jimmy knows what he's doing blind if he can run if he can help us

[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:21.180]
with that running game and then of course Lawrence Phillips couldn't even make

[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.920]
it to the start of the season before we got cut with another rock contour

[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.980]
time so they're in plantation but the most of the fans don't care if they can

[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.700]
help us win and then we feel better about ourselves we're part of a winner

[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.480]
they don't care about that stuff you can do whatever you want that's so true

[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:40.080]
and you got another person for your DNH deal okay thanks for the good news okay

[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.600]

[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:35.160]
the dolphin tickets which was very appropriate and then one of the people

gable hello top of the morning to the Neil yes sir I say I'm from the water company

[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:55.780]
that you have the you still have it down there but I went down there about two

[00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:00.420]
weeks ago and spoke to and I didn't know that you had called her the water

[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:04.320]
Nazi at the time and I can understand why what I wanted to do was get a

[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:09.600]
filtration system put in there with a nice cooler that everybody could have as

[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:14.260]
much water if they want they pay one monthly price yeah okay you're dreaming

[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:18.300]
well yeah and on my front of that car for the water Nazi who I just find out

[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:23.380]
that she has been crowned at the dubious title she gave me this work

[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:27.980]
currently satisfied with what they got without me just talking we're not gonna

[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:31.980]
spend any more money so these bags that can be free water it would have made

[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:36.360]
her a hero because I was actually saving the company money right when to save

[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.380]
the station money by putting in a few coolings hooked up to one central

[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:43.940]
filtration system it would have been the same thing as bottled water you would

[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.920]
have been making it there the exact same damn way that we make bottled water

[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.720]
at our company except with you know without the bottle yeah you would have

[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:57.720]
no delivery no anything else just like a reverse wash message right except with

[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:03.740]
coolers at your disposal uh-huh and then thing is bottled water coolers but with no

[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:09.540]
bottle right I understand and now I'm so you know because we're happy with what

[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:13.960]

[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.180]
it's not like they're doing me some kind of a favor here like I'm leasing this

[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:35.080]
joint like those brokerage stations like I'm coming on hands and knees begging to

[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:39.420]
buy some air time to get on a year I'm making these people are goddamn

[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.680]
fortunate and do they have any understanding or respect for what we're doing in

[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:49.160]
here no none none that I got the general manager who comes down this morning a

[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:54.240]
second time that we're now having another meeting Friday with my lawyer who

[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.940]
announced to me after Bluff Lindsey calls up Georgia we got two two

[00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.940]
affirmations on this now that they're gonna back off the last break on a

[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.460]
morning show so I don't have to follow eight nine and ten minutes of

[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:07.100]
commercials like like one of the just put an announcement on there saying turn

[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:13.160]
it off now because we got nine minutes of spots coming on who would have

[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.320]
ever heard of such a thing and what kind of bump forks if we got there working

[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:21.480]
on that morning show I mean I guess it's fine if you're lazy you got to get up

[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:25.440]
early in the morning so maybe that maybe that compensate for it you know

[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.300]
fine I wouldn't mind getting up out here every day at 10 minutes to two that

[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:33.500]
would give me home 10 minutes earlier would I do it no no of course not would I

[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.760]
do that to Hank no a chance in a million that I'd back up all the spots against

[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.800]
trineman chance in hell they're gonna ever legalize marijuana in fact they're

[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.140]
even now they're changing the laws you know in California

[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.660]
some of those joints that they had where they could get the people who needed

[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:23.240]
medical marijuana now they're starting to the law there was a court

[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:27.340]
ruling yesterday that came down same that they can close them down people who

[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:31.340]
are like in tremendous pain people who have cancer horrible diseases who are

[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:34.140]
in horrendous pain have finally found therapy

[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:38.460]
that relieves them of their pain and as the government allowed them to have

[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.840]
their therapy no because the government is playing goody two shows but in the

[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.520]
meantime the overwhelming majority like the peace on NBC news said last night

[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:50.160]
of deaths on college campuses are not from drugs of any kind but they're from

[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:51.620]
booze

[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:03.160]
and i you know i've always said it's one of the reasons i don't go to football

[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:06.440]
games probably the main reason i don't go beside the fact that it's a

[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:10.760]
hassle to get out of that joint is who the hell wants to be at a sporting event

[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.600]
where you pay through the nose or even if you got free tickets like i get here

[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:18.060]
and sitting in the middle of a bunch of rowdy drunks oh you knocked over my

[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:23.760]
beer man yeah right i'll never forget that one as long as i live fat

[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.440]

[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.300]
the fourth quarter or whatever whenever they cut it off at any sporting event

[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.920]

[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:59.780]
wherever you're gonna go maybe two or three might not be too bad we don't want

[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.460]
to kill them like a whole bunch of people like the guy that time leave in the

[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:05.820]
limo arena from a hockey game who almost cut me who he did cut me off

[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.680]

[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:17.280]
yeah right you know there's nothing right and see this is another thing you

[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.500]
go to Germany you go to Amsterdam you go all over here and you see people

[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.360]
sitting outside of the cafe and the pubs and they're drinking their beer

[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:27.220]
starting like 10 o'clock in the morning you see any drunks no

[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:34.940]
never never maybe once in a blue moon you see some old you know deadbeat

[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:40.120]
poor poor soul but other than that you don't see people stay it even with the

[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:43.400]
two of the drugs that they do the the marijuana and the hash that they do over

[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:49.180]
there that they don't enforce the laws you never see it never see people walking

[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.940]
around stoned out of their mind stagger you don't see it

[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:54.680]

[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:59.120]

[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:02.360]

[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:45.600]
the pay and possibly pay a ten dollars yeah i mean that's that's the rule kicker i

[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.800]
mean that that's right ten dollars eight dollars for season ticket holders

kings have been playing pretty damn good last year and then again so far this

[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:12.040]

solutions for the immediate world around me here and this morning by blowing off steam i made a

[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.080]
solution to at least one problem that we had here and i'm going to make solutions to some of the

[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:02.080]
other problems we got and if that's what i have to do if i can't get response out of the people

[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:06.060]
that i work for and work with any other way then that's what i do because i've done it for years

[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:11.160]
and that's the only thing that'll get them to do off their ass so i can make solutions in my own

[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:14.680]

my dad knocked me off i was a little queen

[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:11.100]
it's not a media mystery i'm just the one who knows

[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:14.740]
oh

[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:20.580]

so he's the one who did it you'll never hear him i did it

[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:51.360]
oh oh three at 550 wqa am anybody see larry king last night see the oh a time mistake

[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:56.700]
didn't hear about until after the fact the fact that he had evidently either john ramsey himself was

[00:55:56.700 --> 00:56:01.160]
on there or represented it for the family with this kaka new theory that a photographer a friend

[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:05.180]
of the family sneak into the house while they were out at the christmas party that night and was

[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:10.540]
hiding in a basement waiting for them to come home now let me ask you this do you think john

[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:15.560]
but a like ran down to the basement with a with a roll i'm asking case you did that all the time oh

[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:20.620]
yeah that's true but anyway if anybody saw it inquiring minds would like to hear about it and

[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:24.020]
then of course just recently all the tabloid they're showing that the handwriting experts are saying

[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:29.140]
that the mother umama she was the one that definitely wrote the aran somnote an addition to which

[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:33.100]
if the photographer who was a friend of the family wanted a kidnapper how come you left the

[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:39.240]
rancid note and then murdered her and uh and sneaked out of the house huh here's north miammy hello

[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:46.680]
north miammy yes yes sir hi nil long time listener and first time caller i'm really nervous too

[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:53.120]
but i love you man and uh one of the highlights of uh uh my stay here in south for it was meeting you

[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:57.220]
at one of the panthers games in the inaugural season right it was great you're a great guy i wouldn't

[00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:03.580]
respond to the last caller um i think that's you know a prime example of uh one of the main problems

[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:09.020]
that we have here in the states uh with people that think like that and especially when it comes to

[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:13.120]
marijuana a number of issues really concerned my mouth which i never said that and then when i

[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:16.540]
when i start explaining what i really am saying oh well i don't want to talk about let's move on

[00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:21.680]
to something else yeah and also as far as you providing solutions for society i think that's not

[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:25.940]
really the purpose of shows like here's the yours is one of the few shows that i think stimulates

[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:30.200]
thought and we are politicians that's who we elect to do that and you should stimulate thought for

[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:35.060]
us to think you know carefully about who we elect to i'm stimulating it right now yeah well also

[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:39.780]
when it's actually original reason for calling was to uh i'm a big lover of the Netherlands and the

[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:43.520]

[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:55.060]
he's there but to sit there and just have a beer and they're going to definitely be a couple of

[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:59.000]
groups that come by the cafe it's an excellent thing to do in between whatever you're going to do

[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.040]
and uh van Gogh museum is great and get definitely get the cassette thing that uh that tells you

[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:08.540]
about all the paintings it's great thing to do definitely and if he's looking for the other stuff uh

[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:13.840]
there's a place called city hall that's great it's uh it's perfect and it's got actually the

[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:28.000]
that's that's great radio but when when people are calling just uh you know they they

[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.840]
i agree with it there's nothing more boring in the world can i suck around for and of course 99

[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:37.980]
percent of those people have got nothing to say and as those shows wear on uh they they have less

[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:41.520]
and less they don't even make an attempt to try to say anything they say like about four words

[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.140]
which i think is very cute and oh by the way can i suck around four fill in the blank whatever

[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:48.680]
we got you're right i agree with that okay well you know the only other thing i have to say is that

[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.540]
all right let's let's make the rule as of now we're not giving anything away for the rest of the year

[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.500]

[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.100]
yeah they're trying to talk about my show they were talking about the station

[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:14.580]

[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:06.580]
hello yes sir it's first time caller uh listen to you over the internet right uh the question is

[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:10.000]
oh wait a minute why do why do you listen over the internet if you're in sunrise because of my

[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.600]
office i'm in i can't pick up a date exactly you can't even pick up the station outside right so

[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:20.640]
but i'll see you over the internet so it's interesting uh question was the friend i were having a

[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:25.680]
discussion he was telling me that the mayor of my army his brother has been indicted or being

[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:31.900]
indicted for bank fraud or something in bezzlement for like three million dollars and that the mayor

[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:39.080]
his brother yeah the mayor's brother joe carolio's brother yes and that the mayor is now having death

[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:44.540]
threats against his life and he has to have around the clock protection um you know for the death

[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:47.520]
you heard anything about this i haven't heard anything about that you haven't heard anything at all

[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:53.060]
no because uh and even george who of course has got his pulse on the finger of the hispanic community

[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:57.620]
in my army he been george is taking me so they have these kind of problems yeah only in my army

[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:02.020]
well how about that thing with the uh how about the threats against channel 10 because they didn't

[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:06.980]
mean to the contract of some hispanic news anchors and on our squeak it's on earth says how can they

[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:11.420]
with a good conscience not have a hispanic news anchor uh on as if it makes a difference where they

[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:15.140]
come from right i mean if they're not that's a mentality in date county sir where do you live

[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:19.920]

[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:33.180]
of good people in date county especially the ones in kennel that are helping us out with our center one

[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:37.320]
CDs no seriously there's a lot of good people in date but a lot of them are like lost it's like being

[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:42.140]
surrounded by a banana boat mentality we just got to report that it was the mayor of choral gables

[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:46.040]
oh the mayor of corral oh my god corral gables that's even worse

[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:52.620]
moral gables where of course you can't have too many you can't have any chickens on your lawn or

[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:59.120]
any ducks and you can't do this and you can't do that it's the can the no can do city corral g

[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:03.480]
moral gables where everybody sticking their nose into your business can't have a pickup truck sitting

[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:08.360]
in your driveway can't have a boat sitting in there if one of those ducks one of those pen and the

[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:11.780]
s ugly ducks comes walking through your yard they're probably going to give you five years in jail

[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:20.820]
even if you got nothing to do with it i say the duck here's a hellendale hello yeah hi Neil okay sir

[01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:25.360]
uh Neil i'm calling because i was uh listen to you a few minutes ago about the uh gentleman who's

[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:30.520]
going to Amsterdam to a talking about city bird i've flown city bird this past summer yeah i'll tell

[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:35.580]
me all about it okay well going uh i go to kupin heygan every year actually into sweet and i play

[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:39.940]
music over here every july what a great place gandanae via manets where the real people are you

[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:46.520]
got it i love it so uh we flew from my name to brussels and it was just actually fantastic going over

[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:52.400]
it was a brand new airplane and the service was great and i really had a great time but coming back

[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:57.100]
it was a little bit different uh maybe because the plane was crowded or something but the um

[01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:02.680]
the staff on their stewards and the stewardesses were we're not very i should say not very polite

[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:07.680]
and definitely very lazy uh one incident that happened was these two little kids were playing

[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:12.700]
soccer up and down the aisle well that's nice with a little ball and i was trying to see a real plane

[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:18.640]
in the year in the airplane in the year right and uh as you know uh it's a long flight and i was trying

[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:25.060]
to sleep um and what happened was i i asked the steward to um have him sit with their mother and he

[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:30.460]
says well i'm not their father i'm not going to do anything about it so i got it my mind i told the

[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:34.200]
little kids uh finally got it through their heads i said you see their curtain up front there i

[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:38.260]
says go up and play up above that there's a lot more room so i sent him up to first class yeah

[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:43.080]
and uh needless to say they were back with their mother in about five minutes hard to read yeah

[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:47.240]
the steward didn't say anything more to me the whole trip but other than that i was real happy with

[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.780]
that it's uh how was the food way how was the food on the plane the food was okay it was like any

[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:56.320]
other i like it but it wasn't anything fantastic but it was great but anyway the gentleman is going

[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:00.960]
he's going to transfer over to subena to go to uh subena has a working agreement with city

[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.200]
bird that's the only problem city bird doesn't have working agreements with very many airlines i had

[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:10.840]
to transfer to staff so i had to claim my luggage you know both ways uh pain goes through customs a

[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.060]
couple of times you know with that because you had to go out of the airport and then back upstairs

[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:20.160]
into the airport again yeah and brosley fly subena from brosle's to him yeah now that if he goes to

[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:25.020]
subena he has a working agreement he won't have to claim his luggage you know and it goes if he

[01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:29.300]
goes keel ember something like that and he'll have to how long is the flight from brosley it's very

[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:35.320]
very quick now Amsterdam probably less than an hour Amsterdam's not that far from from from

[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:40.440]
from brosley and back so i was sitting with a guy that was driving into Holland i don't know if he

[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:45.200]
was going to Amsterdam or not but it's it's not very far at all it's a very short flight so would

[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.540]
you do it again because they were their fairs are very cheap they are right and that's that's a good

[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:54.000]
thing about it but the only the only hassle is though that they do not fly direct they fly to brosles

[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.260]
and no matter where you're going in Europe you have to get a connection out of brosles to wherever

[01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:03.380]
exactly exactly the exact way it was in august and july i'm sorry uh but i was you know it wasn't

[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:10.320]
bad um they if you put fragile and stuff on your on your baggage uh they get it to you right away

[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.600]
right at the way for it so i was i was overall very happy except for the little incident with the kids

[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:20.800]
going over like i say it was fantastic so i was like a raser just shoot the kids and have a great time

[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:26.600]
for me i say uh thanks a lot okay okay i have a great day okay we got uh look at this

[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:31.420]
open line and broward all three and date again i mean uh you know two hours and that's right we didn't

[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:34.800]
start this to eleven o'clock because i was riding and raving the first hour which by the way i

[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:40.620]
make do apologies for because everything needed to be said and i stand exactly but why what i

[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:45.200]
say this is the day i you know i've said this before but again i get you know you wear yourself out

[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:49.740]
but today i've got for some reason enough energy to really mean it this is the day i'd run a line in

[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.460]
the sand either they get their craft straightened out here or we'll just go on strike for a couple

[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:58.520]

[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:19.800]
and as far as a domestic airline i want to say one more time american airlines great

[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:24.020]
who says i never say anything good if you do something good by me i'll come on a year and rant

[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:31.400]
and rave about how great you are for uh for hours even in coach american airlines the food is pretty

[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:38.060]
damn good and in first class it is out of this fricking world excellent so i can only imagine what it

[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:43.240]

sir yeah i'm like you in a couple ways but you know my wife says you talk that i talk negatively

[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:16.480]
about so many people and i try to explain it to most people are at so right that's true

[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:21.700]
you know i mean i give credit like you where it is deserved but it deserves so little by most people

[01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:26.880]
the other thing is with my job uh i do all this advanced work and i maybe i'm a perfectionist

[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.680]
to a fault but uh everybody around me doesn't do this so it renders my job meaningless and what i've

[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:36.600]
done in advanced preparation right so it's just that it's so frustrating it's very frustrating when

[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.480]
you work for people who refuse to care and they look at you like you're a troublemaker why don't

[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:44.620]
you just go through the motions like we're doing i can't do that i just don't have it in me that's

[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:48.900]
that i'm better than anybody else that's just not my style i can't do that yeah no no now

[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:54.300]
relating to these sporting events here i love it when the heracons are are doing bad and not so much

[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:58.820]
because i like the job of the sea of wind but when when people don't go because i was in that corner

[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:03.580]
in zone spread out i had about eighty chairs around me with nobody around me bothering me you know

[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:08.800]
i went to one game or earlier the guy kicked my soda over and you're just falling over drunk and

[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:14.940]
i i i used to go to the game yeah exactly you know and uh you know what you know and uh

[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:20.640]
i hate even going to games now i mean i really do i used to go to all sporting events but i'd

[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.860]
rather stay home and watch it if it's on you know i don't know the thing if i would have used my

[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:28.480]
tickets to go see the dolphin game on sunday i wouldn't have been home to to watch the uh the end

[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:32.980]
of the uh bills game against Jacksonville and i also wouldn't have seen the entire san francisco

[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:37.580]
colts game which turned out to be there were two unbelievable games there who now wants to go out

[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:41.620]
there and sit and watch a ponderous uh terminal uh effort which i watched for five years born

[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:46.140]
i'll tell you a way it was terminal but i i brought bring my little tv and i watched the end of

[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:50.840]
it the jacks of course i don't have satellite you know but uh i mean i watched the end of that game

[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:54.420]
i mean it's a pleasure to you know put the headphones on listen to man that you're in this

[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:59.020]
infer i mean the wrong guy he's calling uh the wrong yard line i mean he doesn't even know what

[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:04.160]
steam it's an embarrassment with him yeah no really like like hang says you know this this

[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:08.420]
company specializes and this goes back to dean jordan who's now left the the high pingo

[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:12.780]
organization but he brings in these guys from out of town they they they fly in uh you know

[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:29.920]
every sunday and then he goes back and does his sports yo on uh wip and piled up here yeah but see

[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:35.280]
as you said they work cheap and uh with you i mean that the article that was written when you

[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:39.460]
worked first coming on the uh million dollar salary but you bring three million in spots yeah

[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:43.880]
yeah so i mean uh that they they got a gold mine would you even if they paid you two and a half

[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:47.800]
three million oh that sounds good yeah well i know one day with that rate sounds good to me

[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:52.420]
yeah you're you're you're bringing in the money more than what they're paying you uh but these

[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:56.600]
other guys they work cheap and that's what it's all about the same with whammy cheap cheap cheap

[01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:01.480]
let's keep higher in cheap and confident assholes and see what kind of product we put out there

[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:07.620]
and then that's what they get so i hope they fail miserably you know okay good luck to us pal

[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:12.140]
there's a guy he's banging his head against the wall and frustrated about it i'm not frustrated

[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:16.500]
quality of life as far as living here and just within the last five years my jobs required me to

[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:22.620]
travel quite a bit not internationally but just around the country and i tell you it's you don't

[01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:27.780]
we don't realize what a toilet we're absolutely living in down here in South Florida until you go

to a real place until you go somewhere oh don't don't have to tell me every time i get off the plane

[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:35.420]
and you get into that uh what's all the thing i can't never think of the name of that thing

[01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:40.120]
you know the skyway the walkway the uh whatever they call that thing skywalk skywalk off the plane

[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:43.820]

[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:51.440]
on right that's right take me anywhere but i can't possibly be back here

[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:56.660]
right most of the time my travels take me to Atlanta and people can conceive and say what they

[01:28:56.660 --> 01:29:01.600]
want about Georgia being backwater and y'all who and everything else yeah but at least the people

[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:06.400]
they're friendly and you can go there and have a nice time and as a city they seem to have their

[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:09.360]
acts together yeah when you go yeah when you go there i mean the biggest problem is maybe they

[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:13.420]
picture no is then but here they pick your pocket then shoot your brains out right but i tell you

[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:20.800]
you know Miami especially Miami can try to consider itself a world class every year every time i

[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:26.400]
hear that i want to pee in my pants for example you travel the world you go to any city any

[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:31.780]
