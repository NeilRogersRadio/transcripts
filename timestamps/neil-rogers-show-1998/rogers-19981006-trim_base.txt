[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.140]
remember old prints

[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.620]
and you know what fabulous place but they got to make one change yeah

[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.680]
since we have a new stadium we have a new panther announcer

[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.400]
sky christmourts like listening him listening to what's that i do with a

[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.820]
stadium

[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.640]
no no no i'm saying we know

[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.880]
no no there are a really is lovely yeah

[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.460]
and but i'm saying since the panther made this new change

[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.800]
they they love them don't you understand they really believe this guys are

[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.480]
hockey announcer

[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.100]
did you listen to you did you know that i don't listen to him i would never

[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.840]
listen to him and by the way the good news is all eighty two games this year

[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.940]
of the on sports channel

[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.060]
even though you got to put up with my friend rimmer and then he's spot-band

[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.860]
which is a big improvement over that moron on the station so the thing that

[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.960]
was uh... you know turn on your radio turned the sound down and turn on your

[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.940]
tv said it was like that he was announcing a funeral right

[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.700]
okay they'll i love you thanks a lot hold your breath hold your breath for

[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.940]
that uh... christina moron to be gone he's got naked pictures of the enjoy

[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.260]
it and even here anymore that's how i think you got the job

[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.580]
are we gonna get started on him again this year i wouldn't even waste my time

[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.300]
i wouldn't waste my breath with it okay

[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.160]
because people are real hockey fans which they're very few from down here

[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.520]
but those of us from real living in breathing place places who've heard real

[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.360]
hockey announces great announces like bill he wouldn't any galvan and mike

[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.380]
langan rich generate and uh... can wilson and people in pre-cusey who really

[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.420]
know how to broadcast the hockey and make it exciting

[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.200]
bob cool when he was uh... before he had his heart attack

[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.180]
those that that crowd then we know what are we are hockey now is all about

[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.100]
you call this guy hockey announcer

[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.700]
only part of the junior but okay so here we are almost at the end of the day

[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.200]
we've lost is he

[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.760]
we lost is he we lost would be because i think i've got upset with me because

[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.340]
of the uh... i told the truth about the cross guy amphitheater what a

[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.760]
uh... outdoor toilet it is

[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.740]
so we lost would agree with that's two

[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.880]
now we got sandy back but that was only i think temporarily we ever heard from

[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.800]
sandy again just that one time

[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.300]
just this one time

[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.620]
we heard from sandy

[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.160]
did we get anybody else back from did we get anybody from the tv show

[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.960]
like one or two but that was intermittent that was along the way

[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.820]
so we are a listener short that's the problem

[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.600]
is the and would be

[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.760]
which sounds a little bit pornographic to me

[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.500]
we lost those two for a ride on what i did is he's gone that's okay with

[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.860]
what it is yet you just want to pay my house again that's alright

[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.120]
but we lost them we picked up sandy maybe so i think i will count her like is

[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.500]
a half because i don't know if she's back

[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.840]
not landing lady we know she's still out there

[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.880]
that's what we have to do tomorrow gonna have to like rekindle our old friendships

[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.840]
out there because it's getting really grim this whole radio stations getting

[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.120]
grim i notice the other shows they'll talk to each other

[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.660]
vote campers on the other day he's talking to donny b for two hours

[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.840]
because there's nobody calling

[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.500]
maybe everybody out there in fact i'm coming to work this morning was like a

[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.360]
holiday maybe most of the people died we just didn't report it yet

[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.400]
maybe all the old farts died we just uh...

[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.860]

[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.360]
uh...

[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.900]
because we're dealing with sphineless israeli's over there you know that that's

[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.700]
why they're here they were courageous israeli's they'd be over there fighting

[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.040]
the air

[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.840]
but they're over here they went out

[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.620]
anybody went on come over here go back over there to the wailing wall in

[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.900]
wail on a matty you fat slob you idiot you bald headed geek you jackass

[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.720]
these are two guys their experience combined experience in television these are

[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.020]
two guys they bring in from out of town to run a td station they're combined

[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.220]
experience in television between the two of them is

[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.460]
they go zero none they don't even own a guy damn television

[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.620]
they don't even know they don't forget about having a remote control they

[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.440]
wouldn't know how to hit when they make the set go on

[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.900]
that's what these guys know about television the big there you go

[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.980]
okay so we survived to that we had our ones in our twos net that one might we

[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.980]
actually have for about two minutes of three share on it but in the meantime no

[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.560]
promotion no nothing they're screwing up to show a lot of putting stuff on

[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.360]
days after it's already you know been on

[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.180]
but then we get to this stone forever business okay

[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.920]
how to excuse for a human being what piece of walking

[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.460]
experiment took that card off and that's my stand that's been sitting there

[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.640]
firmly entrenched for several days now

[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.980]
and i mentioned in george what happened to god damn card that was sitting up

[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.580]
this is all robbers in their pockets and run on friday

[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.320]
rob cappellan was in here diddling with my goods on friday how do you like that

[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.660]
which i've often fantasized about that but i didn't think it was going to be

[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.280]
these goods are you ready for that rob cappellan was in here fiddling with my

[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:14.180]
joint on friday and again i don't blame in him i understand he wants that

[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.200]
grow the big pair he doesn't have he's working on it real hard stephen he's

[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.680]
working on it trying to grow the big pair they're not growing though they're

[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.360]
like the bebes because maddie and vicki are upset

[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.320]
so they take my postcards stone forever out of here

[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.920]
because we're running into ice now i want you to keep in mind during the

[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.600]
entire half hour show last night i'm puffing on a god damn stogie

[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.760]
okay george is sitting in there blowing smoke we got you can't even see

[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.620]
in here it's like we're lost in a big effing cloud in this god damn place okay

[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.520]
let me light this up again okay just to make my point how many times do i like

[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.360]
this during that half hour last night i watch the damn show it'll give you a

[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.760]
cancer and a tumor and it'll kill you bad for you and we don't want to pay all

[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.940]
your medical bills okay there you go

[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.160]
smoke up the ass all over the god damn place we're blowing smoke

[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.900]
so here i am smoking stogie's on the show which i do almost every day on this show

[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.780]
and have been for four months now but we're running that toy smoking care

[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.580]
it's got nothing to do with your anti smoking campaign

[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.900]
it's got to do with the fact and of course on kinets frequency they're

[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.580]
smoking all kinds of stuff who knows what they're smoking on at your every night

[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.240]
over that's after midnight well a big deal

[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.800]
we have more disclaimers on there about parental discretion and they're

[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.660]
doing all kinds of grotesque things on there and put your kids in the god damn

[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.220]
oven and get them out of here put them in the dumpster in the you know

[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.640]
enjoy it

[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.620]
had nothing to do with the fact that they're running an anti smoking campaign

[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.180]
it had to do with that they're spineless and gutless and really if they were

[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.180]
smart if they would do something that fits in with their own mentality

[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.640]
they would have spider-man and mash on twenty four hours of it that's that

[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.040]
that's their level that's the level of whammy channel 69 spider-man and mash and

[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.640]
maybe once in a while the monsters and if they really want to get carried away

[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.340]
k pasta us a but not the one where rocky comes out naked with the tower

[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.820]
around his waist not that one that's getting a little bit too carried away okay

[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.300]
okay okay yeah bet i mean you talk about

[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.680]
gutless coward

[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.220]
the essence of this show is that it is outrageous that i say things on here

[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.240]
that make a hell of a lot of sense by the way

[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.580]
like the stupid god damn pot laws in this country if i were some kind of a

[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.900]
pot head if i haven't smoked the crap which i don't even like the way it smells

[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.420]
much less having to start to smoke it then i'd be like a normal can you know

[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.460]
i'd be like uh... here try to encourage people to uh... to do it

[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.000]
i don't give a crap whether you're smoking or not it's innocuous it's in name

[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.880]
it's ridiculous

[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.580]
and what i do go to i'm stood on and you walked on the streets there like a

[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.280]
rudavacilin and every other street there's a cafe's and you smell uh... you

[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.540]
know each each cafe has got a menu not exactly like this one that we got on

[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.760]
this card here not exactly like this one that's got uh... for example fc

[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.940]
de pop up from the Vatican holy grass fifty gilders twenty five bucks

[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:05.020]
but in any way uh... in you walk down the street and the the aroma of the

[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.360]
pot and the hash that's being smoked inside lots out of the street and say

[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.380]
that's thanks actually when you come in fact you're really sure whether it's the

[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.400]
dog on the street or whether it's the uh... pot that they're smoking inside

[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:19.780]
and who cares and nobody they're not having reaffirm madness over there

[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.560]
people are shooting each other in a street over there they're doing it here

[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.600]
last time i checked

[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.960]
so at the point of the putting this up here is to make a point to make a

[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.840]
god damn point and there's one and so god damn scared like i said

[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.240]
this show is too hot for them to handle it has been since the

[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.540]
beginning okay

[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.780]

[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.100]

[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.040]
crap in here okay

[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.040]
oh my god spying list gutless cowards

[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.040]

ball of an area sweating up a storm poor bill direct

[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.780]
that was their idea of a revolutionary local show there that was hot

[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.280]
is that gone uh... won't see that no more yeah them and us we're the ones

[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.500]
getting canceled everybody else is still on our generation in yay is there

anybody watching generation in yet no they ever get a number no

[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.340]
city desk they're still the one the same city desk that stupid herald show

[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.540]
which they heard as long since that right about where he by the way but never

[00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.880]
less they're hoping they might do it again

[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.820]
they're running the same episode of the tool ladies where they found the dead

[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:07.020]

the red card they're sitting out the messages grow up america that's the

[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.660]
message on the show you know i see a tremendous parallel

[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.680]
between the american attitudes about drug certain ones which are called drugs

[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.840]
which you grow in a backyard in the ground and this crap that's going on in

[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.200]

[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.580]
being subjected to this garbage and of course we know it's not partisan right

well republican sixteen democrats we know there's no politics involved

there's no nonpartisan and they really want to come up with a fair

[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.700]

[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:13.320]
everybody home same thing grow up america come into the real world stop with

[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.580]
this sanctimonious constipated hypocrisy which is really what america's all

[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:22.040]
about and i guarantee you some of the same assholes that are sitting there

[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.160]
running these no smoking campaigns you know what it reminds me of remember

[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.340]
the scene in fatso where he goes to the uh... the doctor

[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.080]
and he's standing on the treadmill domdelewis the die doctor

[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.980]
and the doctor this crack doctor is standing there with a stethoscope and he's

[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.440]
smoking a cigarette while dom is and he's looking at his a watch and he's got

[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.980]
the stethoscope but it and he's a puffing away on a

[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.200]
bag it while domdelewis is doing the treadmill

[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.000]
same thing how many people involved in these no smoking campaigns and the

[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.160]
screaming and he'll be because it plays good with the public how many of these

[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.500]

[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.080]
sure

[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.620]

[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.580]
time we get done with this of course he's got so much crap in his system

[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.200]

[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.440]
lighting up my night cigar from next

because i want to make sure that none of you out there smokes it cuck you know

[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.200]
and this is the this is the amusing part of the whole deal you go everywhere

[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.380]
else in the world they smoke and if they die they die but that's their

[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.200]
own they picked your own poison you go into the supermarket and there's all

these night trights and night traits and preservatives and chemicals

[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.580]
people are dying every day people are getting cancer like it's going on a

[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.880]
style in this country because everything is made for shelf life not for your

[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.140]
health it's big money it's big bucks they put it out there in the

[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.880]
shelf so it'll last a long time and in any time it's got all kinds of

[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.300]
crap in it that you're putting in your body and some of you're going to

[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.220]
die from cancer from it does that mean i'm gonna sit here and pontificate

[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.320]

[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.860]
yeah that oh gee don't eat that whatever you do

[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.460]
by the way speaking of don't eat this or don't eat that all you stock market

[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.000]
experts out there with the markets having a pretty good day so far today we

[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.220]
underline the so far the Dow is up 101 the Nasdaq's up about 32 something

[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.600]
like that but all the experts out there what do i tell you these people don't

[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.300]
know what they're talking about any of them now the single one of them they

[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.860]
may know all the terms and all the ends and the out but as far as really

[00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.360]
have any idea what they're telling you they're just a bunch of peddlers they just

ten thousand shares at fifteen bucks a piece

[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.140]

[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.480]

[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:02.320]

go up on the russian thinking about it

[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.180]
davide once again you know this davide at the sunset and all he's an ass oh my

[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.140]
god talk about growing up

[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.200]
you know here here's this story about you know of course they're doing it to

[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.300]
put to boost up the excitement because we got to really mediocre teams that

[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.120]
were the worst teams in league last year so we have to have this big can

[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.820]
track controversy between the lightning and the panthers will be playing

[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.780]
friday night the opening game in the amacarena

[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.840]
so panthers a temp of players use racial slurs and gestures about peter or well

[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.800]
here's the new deal

[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:44.420]
this is a game where guys take sticks and whack each other over the head who

[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:48.400]
give each other guy other concussions who do permanent bodily damage to

[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:48.840]
each other

[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.460]
who do some of the most grotesque things to each other in the history of the human

[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.300]
god damn race

[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.380]
and now they're doing something even worse they're calling each other

[00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.000]
name

[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.500]
that's right

[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:02.780]
you

[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.820]
yeah that's right we had that thing with christmas last year

[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.580]
you know good you

[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:10.660]
smarter

[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.900]
and so evidently a couple of lightning players are alleged to have had

[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:20.280]
Tucker and McCarthy okay standing McCarthy and dursy Tucker allegedly called

[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.180]
peter or well in ape and they were saying you

[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.380]
uh... king ape

[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.260]
at the exhibition game over their last Saturday and the panther players as they

[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.060]
went off the ice called jokka the merr is the coach of the temp of a lightning

[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:31.540]
a

[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.900]
which i say

[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.680]
array

[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.100]
because he is a

[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.340]
king frog is there any other kind no first that

[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:41.860]
he's a

[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.200]
fraud that jokka merr's

[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.800]
so they've had of course is just outrage this morning another one of our great

[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.720]
sports columns in his backwater horse ball town

[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.200]
and hl cantaloupe racism to continue

[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:02.000]
oh yeah that's right so with the theory that this could be teared into the

[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.960]
worst and bluddiest display of hockey Friday since lap shot i guarantee it'll be

[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.680]
a bad display of hockey all right but not because of violence or name calling

[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.460]
yes six and stones especially hot is not how that goes hockey sticks and

[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.560]
stones can break my bones but names are a bunch of crap is not the way that

[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:17.980]
thing goes

[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.740]
that's what they taught me was a kid growing up they said

[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.760]
hockey sticks and stones but uh... all of the calm people names is a bunch of

[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.520]
crap yeah right

[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.340]
as in your stupid bag whatever you are who cares

[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.940]
i mean what they hide you ought to run and hide you ought to be local with the

[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.400]
guide them uh... henry hide

[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.360]
man or what i want to call them just perfect for just ripping up into little

[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.380]
pieces and smithereens here about gary betman's got this big job to do now

[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:48.160]
because any McCarthy said this and christryman said that and this one yeah right

[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.220]
not only are they trying to kill each other out there in the ice

[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.600]
they're calling each other

[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.980]
names oh my god

[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.480]
how do we get a survive that

[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.160]
grow up america okay and stopping so uptight about everything

[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.200]
everything in this country they're uptight about no one we got all these

[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.700]
psychiatrists uh... making big bucks in this country

[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.280]
to only place in the world where everybody's got at least two or three

[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.060]
personal shrinks even at even at slot monica had a shrink that i ring

[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:18.920]
casserole bitch

[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.380]
that i was reading that stuff yesterday the good stuff

[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.580]
which i noticed not a bad guy that how should issue a committee here not

[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.460]
that got me hearing

[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:30.140]
don't confuse those twenty one republicans insisting democrats with any

[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.420]
uh... information because it's strictly a partisan bunch of horseball crap

[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.500]
president had an affair they tried to get everybody to welcome her up cover

[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.800]
is perhaps like every other human being in the world does

[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.020]
and now we got a big major investigation and can star is leaking and leaking

[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.120]
for the court to check that you're in okay

[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.860]
get a urine sample from can't start check it right away for the court

[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.780]
what he's smoking with his bull crap

[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.460]
and Henry hides it's up there with a straight face yesterday

[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.140]
well you know and of course then they want a passing this thing that they're

[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.900]
going to send out the full house oh yes we want to brought us we don't want

[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.360]
to have our hands tied like rob capitol we want to have the broadest possible

[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.800]
investigation here so we can go back to file gate and whitewater and travel gate

[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.260]
and gate gate and the yeah

[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:15.240]
even though after four and a half years and fifty million fifty five million

[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.260]
dollars now he couldn't find one goddamn thing to implicate clinton on any of

[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:24.880]
that stuff well we just just in case just in case something pops up not that

[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.820]
but just in case something sluggish across their desk we just want to keep it

[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.720]
open so that we have something else with even though this is totally non

[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.420]
partisan and they don't come anymore fair and judicious and that white hair

[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.400]
and we hide and then they sit there because they know that this hearing is on

[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.720]
television so they're all sitting there acting very diplomatic because they

[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.880]
want to give the appearance of being bipartisan and yet air be voted strictly

[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.360]
along political lines are they kidding anybody no anybody with an IQ larger than

[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:54.160]
their thumbnail no of course they're not a tremendous waste of time because we

[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.080]
live in a country where people refuse to fn grow up that's right that's why we

[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:03.900]
can't even that's why I have to say fn as an fn zivola junior because the fcc is

[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:10.900]
the word police to baby they're the one police because if he should say on a

[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.340]
year oh my god everybody in that whole world will take up right there on the

[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:21.160]
floor grow the hell off like you go to Europe and you hear these songs and they

[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.500]
got every word that's ever been invented and then you hear the American

[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.520]
version that comes over here or the videos and they all have to be sanitized they

[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.760]
have to take the f*** words out because we know I don't offend anybody because

[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.680]
our people are emotional cripples they've been raised and trained to be

[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:39.800]
emotional cripples and this whammy thing let me say it again if you think I'm

[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.620]
finished with this you ain't heard nothing yet and I know the show they're

[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.480]
gonna take it off I don't really care is it gonna change my life is it gonna

[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.700]
change my income one dime for the next eight months no fact after that is gonna

[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.980]
make a difference to me really when you come right down to it no I'm making

[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:57.600]
any money really when you come right down that no and I mean the trend is

[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.380]
response we've had on the show since we've been doing that TV show I think

[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:05.400]
maybe it's having an inverse effect so it's not gonna change my life when I

[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.440]
older that's not the point this isn't sour grapes because everything else

[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.260]
they put on there has turned a crap anyway so why should we be any different

[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.420]
anybody any jackass can get out a bunch of old video tapes in our Reels of

[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:22.800]
Mesh and the monsters and throw that on there in K Pasa USA from 100 years

the food about the water they drink about the stuff they stick in their

[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.800]
purse and then let them make their own stupid decision

development's last the two three weeks I would say and it's getting worse it's like the the

[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:36.920]
world markets man getting worse by the minute we have we have the alienation of affections in

scratchy voice ought to go back on a subway and get out of here but we got a day problem that is

[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:55.060]
devastating if we could put date back together we might actually have a life here but I have my doubts

[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:03.200]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18t wireless line in date here's deer field hello

[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:19.480]
we're in the spot on it yeah commercial anyways Joel wipe it off anyways what they said is they said

[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:26.400]
you can see them at 10 30 only right 30 p.m. why did it used to be at 9 30 and 10 30 yeah now it's 10 30

[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:31.240]
only now it's 10 30 only yeah whenever they feel like putting it on that's the way it's been since

[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:36.100]
the beginning since we began this escapade with the high school uh-television whenever they feel

[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:40.580]
like putting it on that's what they do I mean I'm not going to fill in an hour on Sunday night

[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.880]
they stick it on their Sunday now they got football shows to stick on there they stick football

[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.600]
shows on there we're out unbelievable yeah this is the way that it's been going on because the

[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:52.800]
thing is so even if you found a show on that station that you like the odds of you being able to

[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.580]
find it again like a couple weeks later are slimmed and on right right in the same time slot right

[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:02.300]

[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:08.500]
feel about um a mission inspection for the state of Florida no it's a joke it's a scam to raise a

[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:13.240]
few bucks that's all yeah they stick a little pipe up your uh rectum and that's it and they give me

[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:17.100]
the ten dollars and have a great life we need auto inspection in the states or I've been saying it

[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.460]
for a hundred years exactly we don't have all these people with ball-pair and their little

[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:24.960]
beat up old brown toyotas out there have no insurance and no headlights and no brakes exactly but

[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:29.660]
this is Florida pal unreal no because I mean we we have some uh me and my family have some thoughts

about you know moving back up north I know you've mentioned Canada before my my wife is from Toronto

[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:37.640]

from the I was born in the states but I have family that live in Montreal and we're

[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:49.820]
deeply considering probably after my uh all this one finishes elementary school we're thinking

[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:55.360]
about just packing it and going up there up to much we all no up up up to Toronto oh that'd be a

[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.200]
good move and definitely the right direction believe me yeah I mean I mean I think things are a little

[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.840]
more secure there than they are here a little more secure and the people get along there and it's a great

[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:08.120]

more than a city of Miami there's Kendall there's sweet water there's coral gables there's a few

[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:23.420]
other joints I guess we're in bad shape there's ghouls Naurangia I tried calling

[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:30.880]
this game yeah I was listening I was listening to I tried calling yesterday West Kendall

[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:37.720]
Phil Henry on KFI and I had I had told them that uh that you told us you know what

[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:42.700]
we're just finishing the work for are you sure yeah yeah I was listening on the internet and uh

[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:48.680]
I let them know I was listening to five sixty and they said oh you mean to you know you mean

[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:55.140]
Neil Rogers and uh I'm like uh yeah and I was I was trying to get on on gear with Phil Henry and

[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:59.240]
they don't accept any calls from the city of Miami right that's right they take no calls from

[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:03.940]
down here because the people see the people that call from down here they want to talk to Phil

[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:08.400]
about when he was here and the people in LA and the people listening to KFI have no interest in that

[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.240]
so Phil being the wise man that he is then wanting to hear any of that right it's like when

[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:16.540]
these guys call here from Tampa and want to talk about Bob Lasseter or the guy that called

[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:20.220]
me yesterday from Orlando that wants to talk about people on the erupt up there that nobody

[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:24.120]
here ever heard of him couldn't care less about so you know you appreciate the fact that people

like your show and they want to call but they want to talk about stuff that nobody now and cares about

[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:33.100]
right yeah so I mean if you're gonna call and talk to Phil then you know don't let him know

[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:37.320]
you're from Miami and don't talk about his you know Miami show exactly talk about whatever he's

[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:57.840]
Robin Williams don't get me wrong it's just that in movies he he picks the worst scripts and he gets

[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.620]
involved in the crappiest movies and he's just not a movie guy that wasn't bad I think that was

[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:09.680]
the one with him and Sally Field I think was in there yeah and that was pretty fine where he

[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:14.000]
