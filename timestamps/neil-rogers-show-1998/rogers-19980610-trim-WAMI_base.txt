[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260]
I've been monitoring your show for seven years now.

[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.440]
Yeah, and I love it.

[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.320]
Hey, listen, I'm ready to blow my brains up.

[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.620]
I am ready to kill something.

[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.940]
I know, man.

[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.280]
Maybe like a hookworm.

[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.840]
I don't know anything.

[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.820]
But the real listeners are going to keep watching it

[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.460]
no matter what a portion it is.

[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.780]
No, but that's not the point.

[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.260]
I know.

[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.780]
Let me just explain one thing to you.

[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.180]
OK, to show you the power of television,

[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.320]
we had a one-shear that translates to almost 14,000 homes.

[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.040]
So if there's three average of three people in a home,

[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.660]
that's like 42,000 people watched at 830 again at 1030.

[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.000]
So it's taken me four days on a station

[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.320]
that doesn't even really exist.

[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.040]
Four days to get as many people watching at one moment

[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.780]
as I have in 20, 2 and 1 half years on the radio,

[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.020]
as we have it any quarter hour here.

[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.160]
Four days.

[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.740]
All right.

[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.680]
I mean, the potential there is phenomenal.

[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.380]
So it's great that the people listen to the show are watching.

[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.720]
That's part of what we want.

[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.740]
But also the idea is to get people who never heard

[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.540]
this show to be watching.

[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.760]
Right.

[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.020]
And that doesn't seem like it's going to be a great thing.

[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.560]
Well, it might not have to be put it on there like that.

[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.560]
I had not if we got a bunch of bozos putting it together

[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.240]
and have this great, oh, we got to see.

[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.760]
One thing about television people, they have an obsession

[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.660]
with like deadlines and, what?

[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.180]
See, this is a tape show.

[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.900]
There's nothing to be any deadline with this.

[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.180]
They can put it on next Monday, a week from the circus.

[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.020]
They can put it on whenever.

[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.300]
The stuff I was talking about the last four days,

[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.900]
it was all timeless.

[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.160]
I mean, it could have been on anytime.

[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.720]
Right.

[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.000]
Originally, I thought that's what they were going to do.

[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.460]
I mean, the Pope was an asshole last week.

[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640]
The Pope will be a silly old asshole with the dress next week.

[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.480]
There was no timeliness in any of that.

[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.380]
Unless he croaks soon.

[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.080]
Hey, let me ask you when those cameras,

[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.740]
like the one that's in front of you and George,

[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.280]
when they're on you, is there a red light that's lit up on it?

[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.120]
Oh, yeah.

[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.700]
OK, why?

[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.300]
Of course, there's not a red light.

[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.620]
I'm not paying any attention to it.

[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.040]
Let me say to you again, I'm not doing a show for television

[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.660]
and doing any of your radio shows.

[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.520]
In fact, let me tell you how misrepresented

[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.360]
this whole thing was.

[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.360]
When I agreed to do this, I was told all sorts of things,

[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.740]
none of which have come true, by the way.

[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.600]
They were going to have a truck out in the parking lot.

[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.080]
They were going to have one guy with a camera in here.

[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.580]
And I'm not complaining about the guys in the other room

[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.700]
because they've been very out of trussing.

[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.140]
They're fine.

[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.680]
But they were going to be out in a truck.

[00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.320]
There was going to be one guy here with a camera.

[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.760]
And life would just go on.

[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.180]
It would be no.

[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.920]
I sit down here last Monday.

[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.260]
They got a big spotlight shining in my face.

[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.920]
Oh, is that OK?

[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.760]
I said, of course not.

[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.060]
I can't sit like this for four hours.

[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.520]
Blinded by the light, baby.

[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.220]
And it's gotten better from there.

[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.360]
Here's Miami.

[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.720]
Hello.

[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.600]
Neil.

[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.200]
Yes, sir.

[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.100]
God, how you doing?

[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.580]
Pretty good.

[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.560]
Hey, you're no howard.

[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.220]
You're a lot better.

[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.620]
Yeah.

[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.660]
Listen, I have the solution to show it, but if I give it to you,

[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.280]
I want to show it.

[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.400]
I wonder if they produced Howard show one time on E like that.

[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.360]
How long it would stay on E.

[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.480]
Forget it.

[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.480]
You know, it's that OK.

[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.240]
And besides Howard had the cast.

[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.820]
He's an on fire.

[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.620]
I'm not here to talk about how it gets ponderous.

[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.740]
And Howard people, you know, God bless him.

[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.980]
OK.

[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.400]
Get Howard.

[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.700]
OK.

[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.640]
During the OK, first of all, the editing delaying.

[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.540]
You got to delay the show for at least a day or two to give the guy, you know, the time, especially

[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.640]
this.

[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.660]
See, this goes back to a guy over in the other place over there on the beach.

[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.960]
One of their big shots from this company.

[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.700]
His name is Stinky.

[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.720]
And this stinky guy, he thinks he's a real expert.

[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.080]
OK.

[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.920]
I'd like to find out what the other shows on the station had last night.

[00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.280]
No, seriously, they had bad numbers.

[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.720]
And we had a one.

[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.920]
And they had like practically nothing is what the Joe is telling me over there behind

[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.240]
your back.

[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.620]
Zero.

[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.840]
Oh, God.

[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.640]
So we better, they better suck up to us.

[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.340]
You hear that stinky?

[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.600]
You better be nice to us.

[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.580]
OK, because we're all you got.

[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.980]
They sampled the other crap on here for three days.

[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.960]
And now they're all gone.

[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.140]
And they were starting to get into my show and now your butcher and that.

[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.700]
I got news for another week like this.

[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.580]
And it'll be a, hey, how's that home shopping coming?

[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.520]
Get those pubics or Kanye's out, baby.

[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.300]
Wasn't so bad after all, huh?

[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.200]
OK, let's go to Miami Beach.

[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.480]
Hello.

[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.640]
Up there.

[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.820]
Hey, what's up?

[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.620]
Listen, I was just calling to tell you that I'm curious.

[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.280]
I didn't leave a lot.

[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.700]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.800]
I saw the show last night.

[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.680]
And yeah, there were some mess ups, but there were some mess ups.

[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.360]
There were mess ups in that show last night.

[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.120]
Come on.

[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.500]
You're a little picky, man.

[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.760]
But listen, the same thing happened on Oprah in the midst of all the whaling as I was wiping my eyes.

[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.880]
It happened to Oprah.

[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.180]
The same freaking bitch.

[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.140]
The color bars came across the screen.

[00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.700]
All right.

[00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.500]
Oh, God.

[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.640]
I feel much better now.

[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.600]
It happened to that goddamn LC, the Borden cowl, look like Oprah with a bone in her nose.

[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.480]
It's at Harpo Studios and it was a time clock and it was terrible.

[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.840]
Great.

[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.680]
And as I was wiping my eyes, I was crying for both reasons.

[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.740]
But see, on Oprah's show, you'll have to be watching for about two years to see it happen again,

[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.060]
because everybody will get the rest fired.

[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.360]
But on my show, it'll just watch tonight.

[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.920]
I will be watching.

[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.660]
I won't.

[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.600]
I will not be watching tonight.

[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.560]
I'll be watching again.

[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.400]
I'll tell everyone to tune in and hope it gets better.

[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.480]
Let's get up to a two-shear just to piss everybody off.

[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.540]
And you know something that will purposely screw it all up and people will say,

[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.680]
what is this anyway?

[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.220]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.840]
But what?

[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.520]
Good luck to us.

[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.500]
Here's a lady mobile in Weston.

[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.720]
Hello.

[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.960]
Hi, Neil.

[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.560]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.240]
It's not just your show that wasn't good yesterday.

[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.560]
I think where me of Miami is pretty bad in general itself.

[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.720]
Well, let's rip them an ass.

[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.620]
That's a great idea.

[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.900]
OK.

[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.800]
Day sucks, but you're gone.

[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.880]
Well, what else did you see?

[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.920]
No, I just don't like the whole show in general.

[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.860]
The whole station, you mean?

[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.720]
Yeah, the whole station, the whole concept.

[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.040]
Well, which things did you watch that you hated like poison?

[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.860]
Did you watch it?

[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.820]
I watched it the first few days, like from seven o'clock, you know, where it just has all

[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.640]
the traffic details on.

[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.260]
They lose breath.

[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.420]
Oh, you mean in the morning?

[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.900]
Yeah, I watched it all day.

[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.800]
Yeah, at least they got good personalities on that morning traffic show.

[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.240]
Yeah, nothing.

[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.560]
Right.

[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.480]
Well, that's OK.

[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.680]
In fact, if I would have watched that this morning, I would have seen the wreck on the

[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.840]
turn.

[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.220]
And I could have avoided a lot of grief.

[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.080]
That's what I should have done.

[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.460]
Instead of when you hear Joe Brennan give some useful information.

[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.200]
Well, he's always like 10 minutes out of that.

[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.720]
He's a puts with a good voice.

[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.380]
That's your brain.

[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.660]
And he's a put with a great voice.

[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.760]
And he makes me sick to my stomach.

[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.740]
I hate you, Joe.

[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.840]
Don't take it personally, unless you want to.

[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.740]
Well, you have a great day, Neil.

[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.720]
Thanks for the good news.

[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.220]
Bye.

[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.660]
And I'm glad you love Channel 69.

[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.020]
Not she hates it.

[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.960]
She hates everything on there.

[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.420]
She hates the tests it.

[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.800]
She thinks it's a commie pinco plot.

[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.880]
Here is a coral reef.

[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.180]
Hello.

[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.220]
Hello, Neil.

[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.100]
First time listener and viewer of, I guess, the television program.

[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.960]
Oh, you sound very depressed.

[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.260]
And I can easily understand why.

[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.540]
Well, I'm depressed because I really like the program, you know, television.

[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.420]
But it seems like you have some really inexperienced people down there.

[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.880]
Yes.

[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.640]
Three-year-old kids that work for like four cents an hour.

[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.840]
And a bunch of jelly beans.

[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.120]
Maybe from foreign countries.

[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.500]
Yeah.

[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.680]
But I agree.

[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.160]
In fact, that's why they put the studio on South Beach because they're getting all the illegal aliens

[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.080]
washing up under shore.

[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.980]
That's right.

[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.240]
I really see a big future for you on television.

[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.660]
Yeah.

[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.120]
Oh, God.

[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.940]
Oh, we thought it was pretty good.

[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.080]
Yeah, ass suckers.

[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.160]
And if they thought that was good, just wait till we get on a real station.

[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.380]
I mean, till it gets done right.

[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.500]
Here's a lady in a crowed spring.

[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.800]
Hello.

[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.880]
Hello.

[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.580]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.120]
Oh, I've been listening to your show now for a while.

[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.740]
And I was thrilled when I heard it would be on TV.

[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.360]
And?

[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.500]
And then I tuned in and, what's up with that?

[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.060]
It was horrible.

[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.500]
Yeah.

[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.880]
I know it's, you know, I know you're not too happy about it.

[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.780]
Oh, too happy.

[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.740]
I'm ready to murder somebody.

[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.160]
At least maybe 20, 30 people.

[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.960]
And you know, you think it was crappy last night?

[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.600]
What are they going to do tonight when they're going to have to edit out all the segments?

[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.080]
No, they're not.

[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.220]
They're going to put all this in there.

[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.200]
Reaming thingy?

[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.220]

[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.700]
They're going to have me reaming stinky.

[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.580]
Oh, yeah.

[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:04.820]
Yeah.

[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.800]
You know, in fact, that's going to be the name of the show tonight.

[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.720]
Not that you arrived at your show.

[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.080]
It's just going to be called Reaming Stinky.

[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.460]
In fact, that's going to play the exacting of the box, like, a minute for 30 minutes.

[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.300]
Over and over again.

[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.440]
Yeah, well, I sit here, uh, staring around the walls.

[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.880]
Hmm.

[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.240]
I just called let you know that you have a 20, 25 year old female audience out there.

[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.400]
Oh, God bless you, sweetheart.

You have a nice thing.

[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.200]
Don't leave us.

[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.840]
Don't kill anybody.

[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.200]
Okay.

[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.100]

Thank God for providing isc forty and frustrated.

Yeah, I've finally gave up today.

[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.560]
I know that there is not what I'm on cable vision one CANIL.

You're welcome.

[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.840]
Why couldn't you just ask that

[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.200]
I mean, I ordinarily I would say killed some good time, but in that case it killed lots of bad time

[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.420]
It was not quality time it destroyed the quality of my life

[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.820]

perception was a little crappy. I don't know if it's my television or the antenna or yeah

[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.420]
Every other channel comes in across the clear

[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:21.020]
I want a big black screen comes on it though. I bet you that's real clear what it comes on for like about a minute and a half that black

[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.680]
Dead screen you know it becomes where you get used to it and that doesn't bother you so much

[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.440]
As long as eventually you know, you're gonna come on. Okay. You're easy

[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.240]
I'm gonna have to call you back. Okay. Call me back

You're costing like 395 get you one of those cheap ui chf ring antennas cost you about 2.95 for five or six bucks

[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:55.300]
Hook it up on here when you want to watch the cable you flip it over to A when you want to watch your over the area flip it over to B

[00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.180]

[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.760]
But I beep but I bop but you got it not that complicated

[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.940]
This guy must be one of the technicians down there. I'd like you to roll to channel 69

[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.340]
Just can't finger it out

Believe me you'll go crazy. I hate I hate to bring the news to you sweetheart. Not interested. Maybe your dinghy would

[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.500]
You ever see LC the board the board and cow

[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.420]
Uh-huh. She's got a couple of big hooters too, but no interest

[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.080]

[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.760]
But you can really see my dinger honey

[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.020]
Believe me. I got a

[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.720]
Let me ask you something are you having problems finding if you're so hot? How come you have problems finding

[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.180]
Some mutual relationship out there

[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.060]
I know some companionship honey. I have so many men that they were gay and I've turned them straight

[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:20.140]
Oh, you turned them straight, but hell yeah, isn't that a miracle? How did you do that? Do you have a magic wand?

[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.720]
No, did you wave your magic wand and say about a thing you're straight? No, baby

[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.220]
Does it disturb you that I have no sexual interest in you or any other women?

[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.340]
Does that disturb you? Do you find that you obviously have a complex about that?

[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.100]
It's just all Jewish men are gay

[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.840]
Yeah, that's true. Well, we know that

[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.620]
Also, in other words what you're looking for is a good circumcised penis. That's what you want honey

[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.900]
I'll take them all at them

[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.860]
Cheeses that what's your problem is?

[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.580]
So I'll take them circumcised and without circumcisation. I'll do the job

In fact, Wally was running around saying hey beaver. Where the hell are you? I said right over here on a Bob Eisenberg's head

[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.500]

Although he does always run around and drag here's pop it. Oh, be chill. Oh

[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.220]

Yeah, but listen you for last 10 years and uh, your show just gets better and better every day. Yes, it uh

[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.560]
Callers get worse, but I get better. I know last call was unbelievable. She was beautiful

[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.080]
I don't know what they were gonna be we're gonna be giving her a number out a little bit later on today

[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.040]

[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.360]
Oh jeez wipe it off

[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:54.420]
Neil have you seen the local section of Sunstand all today? Oh, it's in a waste basket. I peruse did that. I miss something

[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.180]
Yes, you did there's a article right in

[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.320]
Front of local section says

[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.580]
Catholic Church force to get ready read from that. I did

[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.960]
Out yet. Oh, okay about the cases that have been all swept in right about the guys in Pensacola right

[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.120]
I'm believable. Yeah, it's very believable

[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.780]
It's exactly what's been going on for many many years and yet both newspapers right these glowing editorials

[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.240]
About how courageous it is that the church finally is dealing with these things openly and honestly

[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:26.020]
Which is a blatant god damn line? We all know that and nobody wants to talk about it. That's right

[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:30.400]
I mean sounds like you wrote the articles like word for word out of here

[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.700]
Well one thing I'll say for the Sun Sentinel because we have a few more English speaking people in Broward County

[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.580]
And that is interested in pandering to their Catholic Hispanic constituents like the heraldas always doing the Sun

[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.920]
Sentinel least the last couple of days have had some articles like this in John Grogens column a couple of days ago

[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.560]
That you know told it like it wasn't made a lot of sense the herald on the other hand is busy

[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.080]
They're terrified that they might the alienate their Hispanic constituency

[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.580]
None of whom are reading their paper anyway, but that's their mentality. All right. Have a great day

[00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:00.920]
I read the airtree okay. We have an open line of dead. Yeah, you fought you fakers over there at the heraldman

[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.980]
You people are in disgrace. You're a joke

[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:09.980]
You're a joke tonight. Ritter people move up in a bailout after after the Tony Ritter got through peddling this god damn scam in

[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.820]
Date County with at Mickey Harrison Zarina

[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.520]
Because they're so concerned about the future of this town right that they're picking up and moving to the Silicon Valley

[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.840]
Silicon Valley

[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:29.540]
And just pander and pander and pander and bend over backwards my god if they ever dropped a soap over there that woman is really gonna be busy

[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:38.640]
Just they've been doing this for as long as I can remember pandering to people who hate them like poison don't read their god damn

[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.240]
newspaper

[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:45.280]
That would be my my sitting here playing rap music in the middle of a show all day pandering to an audience that I don't be having

[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.940]
They do not be listening okay the rap has do not be listening to this show they be puffing it and puff that II

[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.800]
Do you know what I'd be talking about? Yeah, all right

[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.320]
God

[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.200]
If we I know it's just I'm just dreaming, but if we just had a real newspaper in this town

[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.680]
I'm just asking for a little uh

[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.500]
I find it bizarre that after that exchange yesterday

[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.640]
That we come on and we don't even get a phone call about it and then I ask about it here this morning

[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.020]
And you know we got the one guy and we got one other person on the phone here because I'm tonny there

[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.360]
There is a divide there is a

[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:20.840]
There is a silent war and a given example. I'll give you a perfect example listen to this

[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:27.980]
The sport first of all very jackass has a big thing about channel 69 years up for switch switching from home shopping to channel 69

[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.820]
And of course his rationale would be oh well he writes about sports on the year and this isn't a sports show

[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:37.200]
So needless to say he writes about the heat games are going to be on there. They got a live sports show 10 o'clock

[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:42.420]
Your benight are going to be doing this are going to be doing soccer and yadda no mention of course the neo-roggers who is on qa

[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:47.120]
In the sports station will be on not once but twice a night 8 30 and 10 30 p.m. On channel 69

[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.100]
Hasdudes and raise holy hell if you have any cable outfit call them up and say hey you're breaking the law god

[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:59.640]
They meant we don't care whether you like channel 69 ready that bogus programming that got on or that fact that's on tonight

[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.520]
We don't care about that

[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.840]
But we want to watch whatever we want to watch and it's supposed to be on there and we don't care if time jikers

[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:11.280]
You know that's what I really love when time jikah compares this experiment which it's an experiment with paxon

[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.060]
You know he had that article a couple weeks ago

[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.320]
He loved it all together about the must-cury thing and they're going to put this on there

[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.200]
And it's going to be on all the cable systems because the must-cury thing fast like the paxon thing

[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.660]
Paxon has just got a bunch of blurry infomercials on there. That's all he's got

[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.560]
Poorly produced blurry people selling a bunch of blurry poorly produced crap

[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.360]
That's paxon and wait till paxon that starts in in the fall or whatever it's going to start

[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.940]
With all those 500-year-old TV shows that's going to go over big

[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:46.480]
If you see that paxon stock lately by the way, well, that's doing big things a big number a real big fact. He's probably doing a big number

[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.880]
Thank you so much, David. He's got the city link magazine no doubt

[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.760]
You've got your thumb on it. How about the magazine?

[00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:01.380]
South Florida radio talk show host Neil Rogers says it's not it like it's just a couple of churches. It's rampant

[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:07.880]
The Pope and the pervert let's hear it for city link magazine. Oh the Pope and the pervert there you go

[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:14.140]
There's Bishop Simon's with a shattered glass thing right in front of his push

[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.180]
Oh, and then it goes on with the whole the guys right. Oh look at that. Whoo

[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.680]
Heavy duty, baby

[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.240]
It goes on with a whole list of these things in 1966

[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:35.060]
1998 1998 on and on it goes and where it stops nobody knows

[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.140]
It stops at your little kid's uh general areas where I think

[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.220]
Here's a lady in aventura. Hello

[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:50.960]
Hi Neil. Yes, ma'am. This is Rose. I'm an aventura. How you doing, Rose? I've been a listener viewers for I don't know since QAM. Oh my god since QAM

But I said heck I want that station

[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:10.720]
Why would what does that mean when they're gonna get it? Well, they just have no information

[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:17.500]
Yeah, I said so you still got the home shopping network on he says yes, we do. I said well, I don't want that. I want Neil Rogers

Thanks a lot Rose have a great day

[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:33.660]
Comcast cable another scandal in South Florida and we want something done about it and we want to done right now or else okay

[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:39.840]
Or else those people have got your cable there in a con in aventura. They're gonna start canceling their cable left and right

[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:46.200]
And by the way, let me point out to you you can get a little a little ring antenna for uhf and pick up channel 69 just fine

[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.200]
And all the other uhf channels too

[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:54.140]
Right stick a code hanger on there whatever not a code hanger and people in aventura gonna stick a code hanger on there

[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.020]
Yes, it sound like jome Crawford now same shoulders by the way. He's posing

[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.520]
Here's the north Miami. Hello

[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:07.820]
Hey, how you going Neil okay, sir? I was calling. I got a bunch of friends up in aventura and they're really pissed off about

[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:14.800]
The whole god damn community of aventura's up in arms. I take the show form every night. I've been watching since the came on

[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.480]
Yeah, and I mean it's like

[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:22.240]
They're a I have one of them that's putting up the appellant. He's only woman's like but they're pissed off that they just

[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.960]
They don't want to have to switch off cable just go watch one show. That's right

[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.260]
And it's just it's not right for them out. It's supposed to be under it's the law

[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.800]
We have a bunch of habitual lawbreakers that come cast cable in aventura

[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:39.360]
It's the law. It's from the fed it's a federal offense what they're doing. I say stick their ass in jail in the electric chair

[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:45.660]
And also the guy they called in earlier about 95 being dirty. Yeah, they already paid somebody to do it. He just embeds with the money

[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.720]
Oh, hey listen nothing's perfect. At least they had good intentions

[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.960]
Have a great day pal. All right. See you keep working on it and the cable too

[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.820]
Comcast we want that on there. We wanted on there tonight. Here's a mobile in West Palm Beach. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir

[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.980]
Hey, watch the 1030 show last night. Oh, you saw the good one, huh? Yeah, my wife watched it for the first time

[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:11.880]
She said you once the twice on the radio or she's raised Catholic. She heard you reading the the manual and she was doing it manually

[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:18.500]
Yeah, let me tell you that chick with the lips that comes on yeah, oh boy. I got a close to personal with that

[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.120]
She was a bit shocked because she really hasn't heard words like that on TV. You know, yeah

[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:31.720]
But after whilst you said, you know, he makes sense. Yes, I did. You do make sense George look good. She actually thought George was cute

[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:32.840]
I was wondering

[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:40.660]
I wonder what kind of cigars you smoking yeah, and one thing I'd like to just give you a little advice. Yes, sir

[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.820]
Keep your eyes up. Looks like you were looking at a teleprompter to the

[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.200]
No, I'm looking at the clock

[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:52.220]
You know how we could solve that by moving the clock down of course that would require a great effort on our engineers part here in the

[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.580]
Asstation, you know, it looks like you're looking down into the left, you know, get your eyes up man. Come on

[00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:03.720]
Get it up. Get it up. Okay. I'm popping one right now a little blue thing. Great show. Thanks a lot. I like to see you. Oh god

[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:03.800]
Yeah

[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:11.380]
Our producer that we gave a lot of crap to yesterday because of his connection with the girl that's got the lips there on the 11 o'clock thing on those headlines

[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.320]
Stephanie. What is it?

[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.760]
Stephanie. Oh, we actually have her name. Oh, it's Stephanie and her lips and it's swollen tongue

[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.400]
But at any rate the the whole crew told me this morning, you know

[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.220]
He does a little bit uptight, but he does have the most perfect penis we've ever seen

[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:30.860]
So what you know, what's not to like that? It was a great story that Rob must have had that dream last night

[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.780]
This father said that he thought he was standing in behind me the whole show his father lives in Evan sure

[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:39.120]
And couldn't see the show on his cable so he whipped it out the a little tiny one little tiny TV

[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:44.800]
With the rabbit ears and was watching from there and of course we've got the Enrique thing with that gigantic huge

[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.680]
cigar between his legs

[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.080]
And he thought that was Rob standing back there

[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.340]
must have he must have a real bad

[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:53.460]
bad TV

[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:59.220]
I mean first of all the tip off if I can use that term is the a foreskin. We know that wouldn't be Rob

[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:00.260]
Right

[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.620]
And Enrique sure don't have a perfect penis like Rob has got

[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.480]
Here is Miami. Hello

[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:08.920]
Yes, sir

[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:14.380]
How did I edit it down from your four-hour show? What's the sit? Do you have any say in that?

[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.280]
Yeah, they had the you know that the wheel they use on wheel of fortune

[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.960]
They spit it around we got the Patsay jacket in there me spinning it right now they have to have wheel too

[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.440]
I like the amount of

[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.700]
We listen we have a we have a staff of 62 goyam in the other room heart like

[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:33.160]
Sitting and spinning and twisting and clipping and sucking and whatever they're doing over there

[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.440]
They're doing it. How many to see more crotch shots of whom of you and George

[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.880]
Oh, if you want to see our crotch believe me you remember a good eyesight you better have better eyesight than Rob's father

[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.840]
I'll tell you that that's how you get the points man. That's how you get the audience. Okay

[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.700]
I said well listen a George you know you guys

[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.400]
Flashback to a George's pussy every now and then I thought oh

[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.540]
Is it pretty charming good looking dude there? Okay, well listen. He'll give you his number in a second not a great day pal

[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.980]
See you. Go ahead and either is he

[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:05.620]
Here's Miami-V. Chelo. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing? They were I read pretty amazing to finally get your show

[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:11.300]
What I'm saying is I've never seen your show or never even heard your show until I watched on channel 69

[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.580]
So your number three. Oh my god. This audience is growing like topsy. Well, it's unfortunate

[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:20.220]
I mean I did not know what time you broadcast in the air and they don't broadcast that along with your

[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.940]
Show in the evening. You don't think there's no time. It's like last night. I finally under penalty of death

[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:29.000]
I did that thing at the end of the show and I'd mention that that's that's a reason it's a little bit slow

[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.620]
Getting people to find the show is because that should be mentioned over and over and over again

[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:37.520]
That's the whole idea of it from our standpoint. They can run it on the bottom with it. Yeah, we can put a frog on it

[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.140]
They can have Rob crawling on the bottom of the screen another thing is why aren't you in syndication?

[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.540]
I mean if this is the USA network right from the cable organization

[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.240]
Right, okay, well, we've only been on for three days. Well, I'm saying is uh, I mean

[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.280]
They've got they've got to they have TV stations in the top 12 markets in the country. Yeah, it's I'm saying I mean

[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.160]
So who can break a point five will get a nasty man. That's right exactly

[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.180]
Screw Howard Stern right

[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:04.160]
Well, I have a good day. Okay. Thanks pal. Yeah, make a billion dollar and god bless you. Bye-bye

[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.600]
That's the idea get it on there in some real markets. That's what we're waiting for. I mean this place say, you know

[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.780]
These bastards here. Oh, we've heard him say that a million time. Yeah, good blow it out your ass

[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:19.600]
But we get on the air in some places where they haven't been exposed to the goddamn anything that we're talking about on here

[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.200]
Where they used to hear in the same people mumbling

[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:27.640]
So you you you got your cable systems you got 400 channels on there maybe and you could flip up and down every one of them

[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.660]
And you got a bunch of people posturing and telling you a bull crap

[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:37.860]
There's nobody who on television tells you anything that's the truth because they're all worried about covering their god damn ass

[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:42.900]
And maybe once every six months maybe one of those investigative tough shows 60 minutes 2020

[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:50.160]
They do a show about child molesting priest or about whatever it is the Vatican banking scandal once every a 10 years like I said

[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.340]
And then the rest of the time they do want to offend anybody

[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:58.200]
I guarantee you won't see those those bear-ass boars on Dan Rather

[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.980]
Huh you won't you won't be asking what's the frequency Kenneth on the CBS evening news right Dan?

[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.220]
Dan

[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.460]
Here's a mobile in four-lotterdale hello

[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:16.060]
Hello, yes, sir. I don't know if anybody's told you I was a little spirited where I was driving in Hollywood two days ago

[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:18.860]
441 and

[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.040]
Shared in street the W.I.O.D. Van was there with a sign of this at save W.I.O.D

[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:32.400]
Find the petition. Oh, you know something. I'm glad you mentioned that because I heard I forget who told me this

[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.760]
But I think that North Bay Village voted on this tonight to go and they passed the thing for the Acondos

[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.740]
How the hell did I get here man? I'm gonna tell you Joe Brennan. Oh, you know something

[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.400]
I forget in the in the heat of all of our discussion here about many other things which will get into

[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:55.760]
I forgot to do this, okay. What an idiot. I want to tell you a story about the brand new world's biggest ass

[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.600]
Oh

[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:05.360]
It's a brand new story about the brand new world's biggest ass. Oh, oh my god

[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.920]
Oh, his name is Joe Brennan

[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:17.560]
He's the new world's biggest ass. Oh, oh, oh, yeah, you know when we were on I.O.D

[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.580]
If I can say that Joe Brennan was an asshole then doing the traffic got a great voice

[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.820]
He sounds like he knows what he's talking about the only problem is here on Q.A.M.

[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.240]
He's still an asshole and still doesn't do the thing right

[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:35.080]
I usually have about a 25-minute drive from where I live to work every day not not all that bad

[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:40.540]
595 is a little crowded coming east to get on the turnpike. There's no traffic at all right it down the Hershey highway

[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:47.680]
Today as many of you know, I'm sure in fact many of you're probably still stuck in it right now. There's an overturned crappy truck

[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.940]
By the Hollywood by the way better tell you it's right by the Hollywood Boulevard exit on the turnpike

[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:58.380]
See we're more concerned on this station telling you about the fact that you know who's the your favorite

[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.400]
X Marlon player your favorite dead badminton player then given a little bit of information out

[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:03.820]
I

[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:10.220]
Mean wouldn't it have been nice for us stuck in that thing for like an hour and a half to have some idea of where that thing was

[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.340]
I mean we knew it was on the turnpike Joe that was very good. It's backed up

[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:17.200]
It wasn't just backed up. It was like the end of the world mister

[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.540]
An hour and a half later

[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.960]
And Joe Brennan doesn't bother telling us that the you know, so number one. It's a stress factor

[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.520]
You have no idea where the actual wreck is and number two you're planning your strategy

[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.940]
I'm gonna get off at Hollywood Boulevard as luck would have it

[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:35.100]
It was right at the Hollywood Boulevard exit you get around it and then you got a clear sailing the other turnpike

[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.220]
Then I get on honeyhill road and guess what?

[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.280]
The very first coming east the very first traffic light the light is stuck red

[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.840]
Okay, well these things happen. There's a malfunction at the junction

[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.500]
14th court is the intersecting street

[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:54.540]
And we're sitting there and sitting there and traffic's backing up and you see the traffic coming the other way

[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.820]
So obviously the light is stuck and there is an asshole sitting in front of me

[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.760]
In a blue or dark gray lamans whatever the hell it was

[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.300]
LeBam sorry LeBaron

[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.680]
And just sitting there and I honked the horn and said

[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.740]
Aaaaaah and I'm honking the horn again and he or she I couldn't even tell they are about the window

[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:20.340]
Aaaaaah I don't know and finally I leaned on the horn and opened the window the lightest stuck you idiot

[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:25.400]
This was just a little frosting on the cake to make it a much more so happy Friday

[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.380]
And of course I was already psychotic before I got into car day 25 this morning to come to work

[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:35.820]
I was already to blow some of these brains out in fact. I just might just to make me feel a lot better

[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.040]
I think I'm beginning to understand this charlton has them thing and a whole gun thing

[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.240]
It makes you feel a little bit better temporarily

[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:51.300]
No seriously I would have no oh and by the way best show on channel 69 spider-man every afternoon be sure and catch that

[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:59.040]
Oh god is it well seriously it's a cartoon, but I missed that when I was a kid well it was a not I when I was a kid that is a hell of a show

[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.980]
Isn't it and then that dance show with all those hot kids on there

[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:10.460]
I'm gonna tell you something boys and girls. I've had some embarrassing moments in my life. We all have on the air

[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.320]
I have never had anything in fact I haven't I can't remember

[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.640]
The last time that I cried probably when somebody I knew died

[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.380]
Years ago

[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.980]
I'm just not one of those crying queens

[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:33.180]
But last night at nine o'clock after the 830 uh debacle on channel 69 and debacle would be a compliment

[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:41.240]
I turned the TV set not just back to the hockey game in the off position and I just sat there and stared contemplating my navel the ceiling the wall

[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:43.820]
You know

[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:48.080]
For some reason the ten o'clock show that sports show which I think is a pretty and by the way

[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:53.580]
We got a one share last night both at 830 and 1030. I have no idea how of course those people won't be turning it again

[00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:00.320]
See within three days on the fourth day we finally double the audience on our show from a point five to a one

[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.780]
We start literally, you know finally people started to find the guy damn thing

[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:09.020]
And a one share to be honest within four days out of nowhere is is a miracle

[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:15.360]
But like I said, I don't think too many of those people will be coming back not anytime soon and then 1030

[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.480]
I switch over from the hockey game nice going by the way caps nice going asa nice shot

[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.500]
And I watched the first segment of 1030 and I'm thinking okay

[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:29.680]
This is gonna be tighter. This is gonna be better and we go to the break and all of a sudden there's that blank screen again

[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.060]
blank blank

[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.760]
Screen and I finally just turned right back to the hockey game and said no, thank you

[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:39.440]
And then I get here finally this morning and George tells me the 1030 was a hundred times worse

[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:46.680]
Then the 830 they repeated the same segment what three times two and a half two and a half two and a half times Rob's penis

[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:52.000]
I mean Rob they tell me and the whole crew seems to know they must shower together or do something else

[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.260]
But they tell me he has a beautiful perfect penis

[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.560]
A textbook penis if you will

[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.040]
But I don't think we need to tell two and a half times in the same half hour

[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.580]
And then getting back to the 830 segment

[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.900]
Getting back to that piece of crap

[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:09.680]
So we have a spot that runs finally and then we have a PSA

[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:17.380]
There's no audio and there's a little tiny bit of audio like way in Bangla desu somewhere you can tell somebody is speaking

[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:22.280]
Okay, some poor bastard there is starving to and that's where it sounds like they are in Bangladesh you can't hear it

[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:29.660]
And I'm just sitting there. I'm getting more and more and more embarrassed and humiliated and disgraced and disgusted

[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.200]
Not that I got anything to do with the production of this piece of crap

[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:38.440]
But how come it is at 10 o'clock they get all those sports bits in there and that thing is slickly produced and they got the live audience about a beat

[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.340]
And everything seems to go fine like a real TV station

[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.880]
How come on that dance party thing they got in the afternoon now?

[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:49.120]
How come that seems to and even those two up punky kids they got earlier in the afternoon. Oh, that's a great show by the way Hank

[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.900]
How come that seems to be okay and they get everything on the air

[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.500]
But this show which is taped ahead of time

[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.260]
They just can't get their ass together

[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:07.440]
Tape the head of time all the Indian all the five-year-old boardop over there's got to do is you know stop one tape hit a cart

[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:12.380]
That's all they use carts and TV just when they're not the same kind of cards they use carts for the spots

[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:20.720]
Hit the cart put the spot on okay. Oh, no can't do that. It is so bush league so embarrassing and so humiliating

[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:26.820]
That I have I have no words to describe to you how embarrassed time and yeah, I got a yellow shirt on today

[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:32.580]
See that's we got all these people calling oh, you'll have a blue shirt on today. You'll have a yellow shirt on a peach color shirt. Yeah and

[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:39.200]
See the idea of being on television is number what across promote this show and number and the station and the station by the way

[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.020]
See the 560 QA to promote this station Hank and

[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.520]
Number but foremost is to reach people and who we will hear what I'm saying what I'm talking about

[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:53.020]
The content of the program which I know for some of the radio audience. That's a real shock because oh, yeah

[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.660]
Is he saying it's um well, you know

[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.880]
They're busy doing Tommy's a douchebag, which is okay

[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:04.040]
But we had a one share last night so we had more people tuning in than ever before

[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:11.520]
In four days and they were treated to a a I have no words to describe it my

[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.820]
vast vocabulary has just uh, I just can't find a word to describe

[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.920]
Enough to bring tears to my eyes. I'll tell you that

[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.820]
It's it's so typical Miami baby. It's so typical of everything that goes on in this town

[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.080]
amateur hour

[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.660]
Hey, I'm gagging on it

[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:38.580]
And now I said I said I hope you're listening because I said can you imagine what what would you think if you went for three trips in a row

[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:44.280]
Especially hundreds or thousands of miles and you showed up at your hotel and I told you didn't have any reservation and I hear this

[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.000]
muffled sound again and then I hear click

[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.760]
And she hangs up the phone

[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:55.840]
Jamaican women

[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.900]
No wonder I'm telling you that's why the Jamaican guys are stone all the time

[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.600]
That's why they're smoking all that weed because the Jamaican women are a bunch of bitches

[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.460]
arrogant nasty and they talked to you in that in that I'm trying to think of a word for that tone

[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:15.040]
It's very condescending but in that very kind of pedantic condescending tone

[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:20.980]
Do you want to get to the bottom of this or are you just you know, just just spewing an inventing

[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:28.160]
Etc. So needless to say I've called back a couple of more times and spoke to a real supervisor who spoke English and

[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.580]
I'm gonna find out what her name was and get her as fired if it's the last thing I do

[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.280]
I don't even care about my reservations anymore

[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.500]
I just want to get this bitch fired because it's inexcusable

[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.680]
That you're paying thousands and thousands of dollars for a service which they can't get right to save and you want

[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.120]
I want to know what comes back down to again just like channel 69 cheap help

[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.840]
Oh god

[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.980]
I don't give a shit anymore

[00:34:53.800 --> 00:35:00.100]
If your toothpaste doesn't taste great your kids don't brush long enough which could lead to ugly tartar buildup

[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:06.600]
The solution regular checkups and brushing with new crust the tartar control toothpaste laced with crack cocaine

[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.340]
Hey shine almost done in there

[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.900]
Bushing get off brushing

[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.700]
Crust is not only clinically proven. It's also highly addictive

[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:22.140]
See your kids will brush and brush and brush and brush and brush and brush

[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.140]

Okay, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead

If you're not careful you're gonna wear those teeth down the little nothing. Oh god no

[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.380]
Brog sun almost got a crust

[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:38.080]
Hook your kids in a healthy habit for life brushing with new crust with crack cocaine

[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:43.480]
Sure, I'm gonna be late for work now, but it's good to see Billy brushing get out old man

[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.220]

Recommended by nine out of ten drug addicts

[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.960]
Here's a fact from Brian who says you're absolutely right about those Jamaican women

[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.820]
I had to take a friend to the hospital last week and the Jamaican nurse was rude

[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.020]
condescending

[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:10.740]
Diedactic bitch. I don't know what kept me from strangling her ripped those Jamaican women a new one's his Brian

Nice going Brian. What what is it with them? Who the hell did I think they are they think they're don't stink is that what it is

[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:22.300]
This woman I'm telling you from the time in here. Here's a situation where they have screwed up big time and granted

[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.200]
She personally, I'm sure was not involved with any of the scrubs, but nevertheless

[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.600]
She's a being paid to answer the phone and to straighten this crap out. That's what she's getting paid for

[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.900]
And she's got a goddamn hostile attitude before I even like said hello

[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.620]
She's got a bug up her goddamn moctome is what she's got or something up there

[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.500]
Here's a mobile and Davie hello

You have a reason to call until today okay, I'm here to talk about them Jamaican

[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.560]
And you tell you something people that are on

[00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:02.580]
People that own service business to not hire Caribbean people to work in their places because you know what

[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:09.940]
They think that every single service job is beneath them. Mm-hmm that they should be working at NASA somewhere or running for president

[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:15.580]
Really right? Yeah, they should never hire Caribbean people. Yeah, okay, because they're too good for the job

[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:21.800]
You're too good for the job. Okay. They are too good for the job and don't they know me or is they suck?

[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.300]
Well, I think you got that backward

[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:30.380]
Okay, I don't know how how whatever you say they suck so there's some good news for you go out and get a Jamaican woman because they suck

[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:38.240]
But other than that no, so the next time that I call anywhere to lodge a complaint or get some information and a I hear a Caribbean sounding voice on the other the phone

[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.380]
I'm gonna say oh, I'm sorry. I'm not good enough to talk to you click and that'll be the end of the conversation

[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.500]
And I'll keep dialing again until I find somebody you know I'm talking about I

[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.760]
Mean maybe I'm prejudiced huh you think maybe I might be uh-huh

[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:56.060]
But when I make like travel reservations when I when you call these numbers if can be anybody that picks up the phone

[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.760]
You know, they're just uh basically telephone operators

[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:09.340]
I prefer talking to a white woman between like 25 and 55 if I'm speaking to a white woman a heterosexual female

[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:13.180]
I have a feeling that my all my information is gonna be done right

[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.600]
I'm gonna get the job done on when I go to show up there my

[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.480]
Reservational be done. I'll give my plane tickets and I'm confident that everything will be fine

[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.840]
If I'm talking to anybody else, I always have my doubts

[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.900]
Here's Miami hello

[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:34.560]

[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:51.940]
The whole freaking family at my house. Did they at least bring us some good weed?

[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:56.600]
And let's know I had a little like half a fight through the whole family

[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.280]
They want to wear white other my dollar who is between me and her

[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.920]
I got upset after me her went out to the festival one day, right?

[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:10.420]
And I was you know, they were smoke weed full of weed. Oh, no, I was smoking the wicked weed

[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:16.960]
Yes, at the best. Jesus. What's wrong with those goddamn Jamaicans anyway smoking the wicked weed? Don't they know it's ill eagle right?

[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.780]
They want part and this no

[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.400]
I'm getting high off of somebody else

[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:22.720]
Okay

[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.560]
All right, let's hear it. Oh

[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.740]
What's wrong with that the price is right

[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.580]
Better watch out for that thick and hand smoke is what he'd be saying right?

[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.900]
And see this this goes back to the question I asked weeks ago

[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:39.000]
I've asked it many times over the last couple of years never get a real answer

[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.320]
From all you white people that go on vacation and go to the Caribbean why

[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:52.920]
Why would anybody in their right mind who's got the spend some dollars to spend why would you go to the Caribbean where there are hostile a hate you like poison

[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.380]
Where does all schwarz is in the first place why would you go there? What's the attraction?

[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.000]
Over to his beautiful beaches you live in Florida and you got to go there to see beautiful beaches

[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:09.260]
They're going there for the dope. That's what they're going there is to get the cheap weed. It's got to be has to be

[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:11.620]
There's absolutely no other reason in the world to be going there

[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.720]
Here's a mobile in Ford Pierce hello. Yeah, sir. How are you doing? Okay?

[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.420]
Um, I just got a little information. I used to be a part of a swingers club and um

[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:26.480]
You knew the six things that go on a swingers club

[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.240]
You would get you would get religion

[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.400]
I'm not religious. Yeah, even though I love the swingers club

[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.800]
Well, let me ask you this. Did anybody coerce you into going there? Well, yes

[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.060]
At gunpoint

[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:46.740]
Well, what happens is they have a lot of anal sex at these things and then I don't know if I can say this word

[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:51.040]
No, no, sir. Let me say it again. Did somebody force you? Did we you dragged into that place? Oh

[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.440]
Well, was it a private club?

[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:59.460]
Yes, obviously and did you did you have to pay money to join it? Yes, but my older sister took me there

[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:04.060]
Your sister took you there and then I was you're high. No wait. Let's let's slow down

[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.400]
You're having anal sex with your older sister

[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.580]
No, I did not have anal sex with your sister

[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:09.360]
Is that what you just said?

[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:17.940]
No, I mean she took me there and I had anal sex with other people for the first and only time my life is a horrific experience

[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.840]
Yeah, and um

[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:25.180]
I'll ask you that you must because you were on a receiving end no doubt no no I can't do that but

[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:31.660]
Um, the six thing about is is that people actually I don't know if I can say this word but they give blow jobs afterwards

[00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:36.320]
Yeah, and uh you're looking for glory holes. Yeah, and

[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:42.700]
That just doesn't seem too good to me. Yeah, I didn't see like that would be that would be too appetizing

[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:46.140]
I would think a good country fried steak would be a lot better

[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:49.680]
I mean if you really want something brown you want some really good brown meat. Yeah

[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:55.960]
But also I can't move that lady. I mean, I don't know if I oh yeah, okay. You're hang on

[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.780]
Yeah, let's get his number not. He's gonna move that lady

[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:03.360]
Right over to the corner and then got only those what's gonna happen and oh geez go clean it off

[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:08.580]
What a maniac. Oh, yeah, he went to a say it was horrible his sister took him there

[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:13.420]
His older sister took him to a swingers club and he was having anal sex and it was disgusting

[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:15.480]
Ah

[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:23.460]
Outer in a Catholic school the decision was reached as the public school system in this town simply sucks

[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:29.760]
It bites it blows yet the local politicians are more concerned about how many more sports aren't as we can build in any event

[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:35.560]
Though I disagree with the mentality of the Catholic school. It was about the best available alternative for better education for our daughter

[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.340]
And the most affordable one compared to private institutions

[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:45.240]
During the school's introduction a book was distributed to the parents as a guide and how to discuss with your child the subject of sex

[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:50.260]
In reading through this book. I found a few interesting items that I thought you would enjoy as well

[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:56.520]
Keep in mind again. This is from a manual distributed in a Catholic school to the uh students

[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:05.900]
Number one masturbation is a mortal sin as God did not create our body for self stimulation fueled by lust induced images

[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.280]
Okay, so put it down guys

[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:18.780]
Number two anal sex not in so many words is also a mortal sin as God created the body for procreation and this form of sex should only be for animals

[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.860]
In other words people should not be a fooling around in each other's rectum

[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.020]
Which a lot of you're gonna be really pissed off about that

[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:28.000]
You're gonna be burning that lake of fire in no time. God damn it. You're gonna be really hot

[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:30.000]
Oh, that's the idea

[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:34.420]
Number three sex is not to be performed as a result of lustful images

[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:40.140]
And if so the individual should try to find a way to erase those images from his or her mind as they are obscene

[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:44.940]
And to allow them into your mind is also a mortal sin put those hustlers down. Okay?

[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:50.220]
Put those all those magazines now put that porn or collection at the Catholic Church has got put that away. Okay

[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:57.280]
And last but certainly not least on the list that he faxes to me and isn't it interesting that we were talking about this

[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:01.700]
On a show only the other day and there were those people denying it. Oh, you just making that up the church doesn't teach that

[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:08.080]
Sex should be done only to procreate and not as a pleasurable activity

[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:11.760]
Should I read that again?

[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:17.020]
Sex should only be done to procreate and not as a pleasurable activity

[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.120]
He goes on to say don't happen after the book with me today

[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:24.280]
It would work however Monday. I'll try to fact you the pages here in sight as the language used goes far beyond what I can come up with

[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.560]
But there are the main points some of the main points

[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.680]
It's so dirty, baby

[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:32.060]
It's dirty. It's filthy and disgusting unless of course the bishops doing it

[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:37.200]
How do you like that? So anyway this professor reclumbia university says

[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:45.300]
The expression oye vee is an expression of deep sympathy at a truly tragic occurrence as when somebody does Frank's an actress dead

Avril Haramon dead. Oye

[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.500]
There's nothing funny about Oye

[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:36.700]
That's what this pseudo-electual real from juzas at Columbia University when you got anybody

[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.300]
Jews goi am anybody take stuff so seriously

[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:43.360]
I mean Yiddish that's the best part about Yiddish is that it's fun

[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:47.580]
It's fun. It's funny. It's off the wall and most of the game don't understand what it means anyway

[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.980]
Well, that's what's great about you a Yiddish

[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:55.640]
Why the hell would you if it weren't for the food and the Yiddish? Why would you waste your time being Jewish?

[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.200]
There's almost no religion to it

[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.320]
Except for the lunatics who are over there. Uh, it's this isn't their

[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.340]
Tollises and their 400 pounds of clothing you're wearing right now

[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:07.900]
It's 110 degrees out there on Lincoln Road which by the way will be closed tonight for Gloria Estefan

[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:12.480]
Big Bash tonner her new album. How do you like that? They just closed down their mall tonight for four hours

[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:18.060]
Because she's got a new album coming out and the people at Sony said they're closed on the Lincoln Road mall because Gloria

[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.760]
Okay, she ain't gonna be there, but uh, you know

[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:25.560]
Closer guy named all down well, she'd expect to be paid of course

[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:35.120]
Fied and we now have millions and millions more people who are classified either overweight or obese in other words real fat

[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:36.880]
Like me and like Murray

[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:42.460]
And like our camera guy there from channel 69 who still eatin donuts and the drinking regular soda with sugar with it

[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:47.760]
Let's see how many mealy's he shovels. Oh seriously. Why do you drink coke with sugar in it? What's wrong with diet coke

[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:55.000]
Do you know how many seriously you don't know you get rid of all that sugar in one year that'll that'll cost you like 10 or 15 pounds

[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.080]
They're only thinking me a lot of right now

[00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.020]
Sugar

[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:04.320]
But how much sugar do you need? How about the goddamn donuts? They don't have enough sugar for you

[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:10.140]
God, I'll make this guy's gonna be sitting on a goddamn donuts. He's gonna have sugar on his back though pretty soon

[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.920]
Oh, and that that's why Barry Diller hired him, huh? He wants to get his licks

[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:16.560]
Anyway

[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:21.320]
So anyway weight loss is the deal how they're saying and they got this new weight index

[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:27.860]
So anyway what I was trying to get to hear my own convoluted way because I'm not gonna talk him about today. He just wants to be fat, okay?

[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:37.640]
One recommendation as far as helping you to lose weight is to be aware of certain fat free foods that actually are high in calories. Are you listening?

[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:44.120]
A federal chart highlights examples that frequently trip up dieters not to mention the extra carbs by the way

[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:49.200]
A half cup of premium nonfat frozen yogurt contains 190 calories

[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:54.100]
That's a half cup of premium nonfat while regular ice cream has 180 calories

[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.760]
For the same amount how do you like that

[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:03.360]
The fat free is the biggest fraud and you broads out there are still running out there with your snack wells

[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:06.280]
And you're fat free this and your anthems and all your other crap, okay?

[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.320]
You're gonna die. I'll tell you that right now, okay?

[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:14.880]
I guarantee you you keep that up in some day. I guarantee I promise you you'll die

[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.820]
