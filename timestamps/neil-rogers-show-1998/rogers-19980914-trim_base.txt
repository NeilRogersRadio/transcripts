[00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.620]
Well, here's how to see a Greg briefly.

[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.080]
Okay, it's 11.32 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.560]
We have an open line in Dave Run and Broward.

[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.660]
5.6705.

[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.840]
In Mentos, out in honor of Monica for the weekend.

[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.440]
Boy, these things are, dude, I bet these are perfect for her.

[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.340]
A real good fit.

[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.600]
I was gonna say it tights it, but I guess at this point,

[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.640]
it's too late for that.

[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.840]
How about lighting up a nice in Mentos

[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.020]
from next to over the weekend, huh?

[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.220]
That's all salute Monica, like with one of these.

[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.700]
Okay, where we going?

[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.920]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.220]
Hello.

[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.100]
Hello, Neil.

[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.740]
How are you?

[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.220]
Okay.

[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.400]
Hey, Neil, someone told me that's far ran for governor

[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.220]
along with Clinton.

[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.760]
Is that true?

[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.560]
Are you ran for governor?

[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.240]
I don't know.

[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.960]
Well, I don't think so.

[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.820]
Who's a judge?

[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.420]
I think that's true.

[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.740]
No.

[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.940]
Oh, okay.

[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.400]
All right.

[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.200]
Anyways, the way I see Neil is,

[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.160]
what do you think the whole thing is in法ment?

[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.060]
I mean, that's what we think.

[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.780]
That's part of what the, either your psychic or your

[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.440]
already saw this.

[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.060]
I'm seeing them when they were reading the rebuttal

[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.300]
from the president's attorneys.

[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.940]
That's part of what they're saying.

[00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.320]
They laid out the thing about how the, the deposition

[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.080]
and the Paul Jones case was a total entrapment,

[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.720]
because that was at the time that they

[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.260]
all lived in a trip to a wiretap moniker.

[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.380]
And the whole thing.

[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.240]
So that's one of the charges that the making was in

[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.400]
illegal entrapment to lure him into, you know, this trap.

[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.240]
You know, I think the American author,

[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.140]
keep an eye on who is going to be our next president,

[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.400]
instead of worrying about this guy.

[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.920]
He's almost going to be out of office anyway.

[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.540]
Yeah.

[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.700]
I'm saying.

[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.220]
Two years.

[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.420]
Neil, before I got out of that, we've

[00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.640]
seen Neil.

[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.040]
Yeah.

[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.560]
If you want, we still stick it, yet.

[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.000]
OK, let's go to sunrise.

[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.300]
Hello.

[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.360]
Sunrise.

[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.420]
Good night, Neil.

[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.220]
Is that incredible?

[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.500]
Yeah, well, I tell you, I mean, I mean, people listening.

[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.760]
I mean, they're on the phone.

[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.900]
I mean, I get a little bit of a guy and then they,

[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.920]
oh, just really trying to.

[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.640]
Anyway, I want to thank you for the video.

[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.960]
I came in, uh, this year today.

[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.660]
Oh, right.

[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.440]
I think you're saying a lot of people that, you know,

[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.260]
they get freebies, they don't, you know, they think.

[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.020]
Hey, listen, they, before the same day,

[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.940]
is over the calling in one room with a hell of a yard.

[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.940]
And the same day that we gave it away, like, I have come to

[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.980]
the mailman, ain't you with me yet?

[00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.680]
And they, uh, they do.

[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.480]
I just thought, you know, I guess I saw it.

[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.520]
I can't even have a backpack.

[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.100]
Oh, yeah.

[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.440]
We do our thing, you know, I think.

[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.180]
I mean, I think I can do it.

[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.720]
And, um, never thought you're, uh,

[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.860]
a little bit of a thing, I think I can say it up to you.

[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.760]
I'm about to say it up to you.

[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.900]
I think it's all, and you can't just just film it.

[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.060]
It's a fast start for students, you know.

[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.740]
So you can get more people to present in the end.

[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.480]
Hey, so you'll be present in this, just for this.

[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.560]
Well, she's just a psychotic person, bitch, who, you know,

[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.080]
was in central Bimbo and, uh, Bimbo and, uh, Bimbo and, uh,

[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.880]
and, uh, he had the misfortune of he getting, uh,

[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.900]
involved in, uh, getting, uh, involved with a bitch like this.

[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.680]
I-I-I-I-I, I-I-I...

[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.540]
I'm a little greener than anybody, but anyway, I hope, uh,

[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.300]
I hope he can survive it, I guess.

[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.660]
Okay.

[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.580]
Anyway, take a look at it.

[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.020]
Have a great day.

[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.520]
You're good, but...

[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520]
Let's go to a leading mobile in Miami, hello.

[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.760]
Hello, Neil?

[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.420]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.140]
This is Bobby, Miami, how are you?

[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.840]
Okay.

[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.740]
You remember me?

[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.540]
Bobby, I'm in from the singles days.

[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.800]
Yes, I've been wanting to hold it for a long time.

[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.660]
My wife said, oh, hey, anyway, first of all,

[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.320]
I want to say I've been watching you on television.

[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.720]
And it was so funny.

[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.300]
One of the listeners, this happened to be one of my good friends,

[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.860]
said, you know, it's telling me how great

[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.120]
you are.

[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.720]
So that you can also wear the amulet.

[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.060]
You didn't even notice if you had a young woman.

[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.320]
I mean, I'm calling you because you're not her.

[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.360]
I'm worried about you because it's ridiculous.

[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.240]
What is it?

[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.820]
You're the first person that has ever said anything

[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.180]
that makes sense about this monochrome.

[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500]
But, you know, I have an answer to this technology.

[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.520]
I want to tell you.

[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.100]
When I first heard about this girl and about the background,

[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.300]
I had it all figured out.

[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.580]
Yeah.

[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.220]
I tell you, I think for mother, you know,

[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.260]
well, one of they had a good community.

[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.600]
I mean, for the mother, she said,

[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.520]
that's the branch of the quasi-stitial in the back.

[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.920]
But you want to say one of the second things

[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.520]
in a happy and revered effort.

[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.640]
Some of the media, the twisted people in the media,

[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.260]
don't seem to have any problem with that.

[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.560]
They know it is questioning why anybody would do it.

[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.720]
Well, as with the guys, the reason I called,

[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.540]
it wasn't easy.

[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.620]
I mean, from the mountain line, I try to go up

[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.840]
to see my mother, driving around and around

[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.500]
to want to call you because I feel so powerless

[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.720]
that that was going on.

[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.080]
You know, you feel like you want to do something.

[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.120]
Have people say something?

[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.500]
Yeah.

[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.420]
It's like this star, out of the way.

[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.260]
You know, I don't know that.

[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.580]
And as I mentioned it, I wrote it on email

[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.680]
to a couple of programs.

[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.780]
Nobody has ever mentioned how star always

[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.440]
had that peculiar smile on it.

[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.840]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.440]
It's called star.

[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.620]
Is that what it is?

[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.040]
Yeah, so they think that's a special psychological expression.

[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.340]
The people who are ready to even kill you,

[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.680]
know that they want you.

[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.660]
Or slice off at the back.

[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.360]
Yeah, I've always wondered that every time you see him,

[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.040]
he's coming out of some garage somewhere, parking garage.

[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.300]
He's got that stupid copy from his in his aunt.

[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.280]
He's got that stupid.

[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.460]
When you think that if somebody was really impartial

[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.600]
and doing this investigation,

[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.320]
they would come out with a very solemn look on their face

[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.060]
like, he's reveling that he's preling from it.

[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.020]
I got a one, Bobby.

[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.900]
He's good here from it.

[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.840]
OK, bye-bye.

[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.660]
OK, we got Hank Gover from Daniel Hyer, from Flagler,

[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.160]
Dr. Ack.

[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.800]
OK, same difference.

[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.480]
From Flagler, Dr. Ack coming up next.

[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.640]
And then we got, what do we got at six?

[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.240]
We got probably Donnie B talking baseball.

[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.740]
We got somebody talking baseball at six.

[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.500]
Somebody who doesn't work make a lot of money.

[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.700]
And then we got the pregame at six.

[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.960]
Three, the Marlins going for loss number 100.

[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.240]
It's the race tonight.

[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.640]
And we got the Dolphins out radio, but also on TV,

[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.720]
Danit, on Sunday.

[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.420]
So it's 2 o'clock.

[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.840]
0560, Q-A-M.

[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.640]
Hi, this is Joe Pesci.

[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.060]
And I would like to be serious with you for a moment.

[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.160]
They're talking to us about a little note,

[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.720]
yet devastating disease.

[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.020]
It's called Tourette's Syndrome.

[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.720]
Many people suffering from this affliction

[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.920]
aren't even f***ing aware of it.

[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.200]
It can happen at almost any f***ing time.

[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.820]
This is one big f***ing problem over here.

[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.960]
And I'm trying to make you f***ing assholes aware of it.

[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.820]
What the f*** are you laughing at over there?

[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.300]
Look at that guy over there, he's laughing.

[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.420]
You think this is f***ing funny?

[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.800]
What do you think of being f***ing funny over here?

[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.300]
What the f***ing so f***ing funny over here?

[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.520]
Did I say something to him?

[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.260]
Use, use.

[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.780]
Look at the f***ing guy laughing over here.

[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.440]
All right.

[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.240]
All right.

[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.740]
Come on, Joe.

[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.520]
Come on with that f***ing guy.

[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.960]
What did you do that for?

[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.520]
You know, you're...

[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.120]
You're gonna have to bury him.

[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.300]
I'm a bearer at this time.

[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.840]
Get your f***ing guy to the jump.

[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.040]
I can't believe f***ing time I had to bury somebody.

[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.960]
Anybody see you?

[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.620]
Good fellow's last night for the 800th time.

[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.900]
No.

[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.540]
OK, sorry.

[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.740]
So happy Monday to you, boy, there's so much stuff going on.

[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.560]
Where the hell do we start?

[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.900]
What's wrong?

[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.280]
What's wrong?

[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.140]
How long does it take to go?

[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.900]
Number 62, who's the f***ing guy?

[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.420]
I'm going to pay back you got

[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.860]
I don't know why Sammy

[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:16.480]
Yeah, at the risk of getting certain people all been out of shape again

[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.480]
Who didn't care last week and aren't gonna care this week guess what I don't get a crap myself

[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.400]
But they care not what a weekend for the Cubs in those two games against the brewery Saturday and then again

[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.860]
Yes today and then Sammy hit 61 and 62 and was there any like a media coverage?

[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.060]
No, was there any like big song and an answer out there on the field like it was from Mark McGuire no

[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.900]
Is this kind of like turning into a racial thing now?

[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:39.580]
Uh-huh

[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.880]
When people first brought that up I thought I hear we go again every time anything goes on in his country

[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.560]
It's a racial thing any minute Jesse Jackson gonna be sticking his finger in his wood pile

[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.180]
But I think it is. I mean Mark McGuire is a big white

[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.880]
goofball and

[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:04.400]
So naturally the media I mean you you Fox people shame on you baby. Oh, of course yesterday is Sunday football

[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.200]
You know we can interrupt that until they did last week for some strange reason they put the cardinal game on their last Sunday

[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.400]
But yesterday here and one of the most spectacular days in the history

[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.460]
And of course Riggley field jam pack and when that game was over when Grace hit the homerun on the 10th inning to win the game

[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.980]
After Sammy had hit 61 and 62 to the meat of the matter and everything will move on

[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.740]
But all they had to do was take all of the salacious stuff and put in the other 17 cartons

[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:36.220]
They could have put an asterisk monolowinsky testified that they did this and you know see

[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.180]
See the appendage or somebody's append something

[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:44.000]
It didn't have to be an air but they made sure they put it all in there because they knew it was going on the internet

[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.800]
For it was going all over the world and they expected the public was gonna say oh my guy something exactly

[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.140]
And guess what they didn't

[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.260]
They didn't say that

[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.820]
They sent out a same old crap all over again

[00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:02.800]
We know he's screwing around and guess what lying under oath is not perjury. I hate to break the news. Yeah, Ken star it ain't

[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.860]
And here's all these CNN numbers. Let me say it again

[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:12.460]
NBC yesterday the new job approval rating for bubble was 67% was up three points from Friday. Oh

[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.560]
They like a guy that knows where to stick his good cigar that's what they said

[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:18.960]
And

[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:25.260]
This morning on CNN the job of approval rating for it's 64% today Friday and Saturday was 63%

[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.400]
Oh, it's going in a wrong direction Ken star. What's that all about

[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.540]
And they asked do you want to impeach this president?

[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.200]
66% said no that says of this morning 31% said yes

[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:44.420]
You see there's a constant 31 or 32% that hate Clinton like poison and no matter what was in the report no matter what the question is

[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.460]
Yeah, get rid of him. He sucks. We hit him like poison. That's constant. It's been that way since January

[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.240]
Same there were roughly 30 31%

[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:59.820]
Should we send sure so that we at least say oh this was bad. Don't do it again 60% said yes 36% said no that's today's pull them

[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:07.260]
The only poll of course that's a little bit off on all these is ABC which the numbers are much lower because sand Donaldson and cookie

[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.640]
Roberts are controlling all that

[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.660]
Boy, there's something really. I mean, thank God that Disney stock is going in a crapper area

[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.700]
The markets up 166 and Disney's taking a big

[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:23.400]
Because they own ABC and they spend all that money on the NFL and those crappy boring games. They're putting on good

[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.500]
That'll teach him to put sand Donaldson and cookie Roberts on there

[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.700]
Doing their spin on all spin on this okay, San you bold-headed geek you jackass with a bad wig

[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.140]
So I guarantee you we're gonna find out today right here on this show

[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.440]
We're gonna have tremendous look at that overwhelming response from this public

[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.800]
Because I think the majority of the people like I've been saying for months now. Let's get it over with let's move on

[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160]
Let's get with the program god damn it and cut the crap

[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.820]
All these like I said before the term is absolutely correct

[00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.800]
These are hypocrites sanctimonia suffocates both in the media and in congress

[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.740]
Fulming it to mouth all this was disgusting

[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.820]
But I'm but I'm open it was right there in a white house and he was talking to congressman on the phone and she was giving him head

[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.440]
Yeah, well made this a stressful job man

[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.800]
Plus how'd you like to get on a phone have to talk to all his boring congressman all day long

[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.500]
Maybe you wanted to stay awake and alert. You know what we're talking about scored score alert rhymes with scored

[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.520]
If the public knew the inner goings on this sexual dealings this is all about

[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:37.360]
445 pages 17 curtains with 2400 more pages and there is two brief mentions of whitewater

[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.840]
Four years 50 million dollars later two brief mentions. Is there anything about file gate? No

[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.600]
Traveligate two brief mentions of whitewater. They have anything on him on that no

[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:53.160]
So it's about sex and the covering up the sex and extramarital affair which everybody in their rye mind

[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:59.060]
Especially a person in a position like the president or a senator anybody else is gonna do anything in their power to cover it up

[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.740]
Oh, we got abuse of power. We got this. We got you got squat is what you got

[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.140]
And

[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:11.640]
They can go ahead and have all the impeachment hearings that they want but these weak need politicians as they're watching these pullmobbers out there

[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.660]
They're gonna say ah he had such a bad guy

[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.900]
He never stole a free train

[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.260]
Let's life him on his limp wrist and move on with life because we see we can read the polls like anybody else

[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:29.000]
Come on. It's after ten or five. Hey Neil my boyfriend said you probably wouldn't return my email from the other day since I'm a female

[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.680]
By the way, do I return any email whatsoever? No

[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.620]
So what does it have to do that? She's a female. I mean if we were young and male and good looking and send a picture

[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.080]
Maybe I would but I doubted anyway

[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:43.940]
But I decided to see what the deal was she says I had emailed you seeing what I have to do for you to get your Florida

[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.180]
Panther opening day tickets since you said you wouldn't be here for the game

[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.480]
I haven't heard from you is it because I'm a female or you're just too busy

[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.240]
Is this unbelievable?

[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.720]
Anyhow I wanted to take my nine-year-old son to the game but never did get tickets

[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.640]
Can you help me? I'll do anything you get the tickets. There you go George. Maybe you can get a picture

[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:04.700]
Tara

[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.900]
Can I borrow those tickets? Although guess what George's ain't got any tickets anyway. He's not getting them

[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:15.280]
This is more hootsbow, okay? Oh as soon as they hear just a little whisper all I got to do is just

[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:20.260]
In passing make a comment that I'm not gonna be here that weekend for that anxious game against Tampa Bay

[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.060]
Oh, yeah, can we have them? Whatever it is you don't want and you got any garbage that

[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.580]
You don't want to put in your dumpster

[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.920]
We'll take it home and sift through and see if there's anything good leftover in there

[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.460]
Believe me in my garbage. You're ain't nothing good. Is there no? I scraped you everything

[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.840]
Then I let my dogs look after fish food container just to make sure there's nothing left over for people like Tara

[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.540]
That want to chop up all of the good stuff

[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.380]
So I discovered something very very disturbing over the weekend

[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.060]
Which I guess I should have known a long time ago. You know that TV show

[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.740]
Now this is something for those TV people to be thinking about those whammy people and by the way nice going on Sunday

[00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.640]
Getting came pasta USA on air. All right rocky itch of a real Steven Vauer. That's for you as we'd art

[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.940]
Boy, he sure look good back then as you look good now. No, that's nature for you. He works in mysterious ways

[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.620]
But here's something for those people to think about you know

[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.780]
The people I guess who are watching the TV show are the radio people and you want to know why the people who get the show

[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:20.700]
The people who would come across there on there they don't get the show and so therefore because I ran into a holy over the weekend that I

[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.560]
Have seen me for in a store and he says to me

[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:30.680]
It says, you know, you're doing that TV show aren't you? I said yes. Oh first time I saw that used to speak and this that I turned it right off

[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.660]
Yeah, see George is gonna get all bent out of shape about this

[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:39.180]
I never said a word to him this morning before the show because I know he's gonna take getting very paranoid about this

[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.640]
See if we're gonna have got comparative uppightness contest. It's no contest

[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.220]
No contest Jews blacks

[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.540]
Gooks any other minority. I mean there's some uppight people in every group, but his Spanish. Oh my god

[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.260]
Soon as they feel that you might be saying anything to pee on their parade

[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.820]
Psychotic I said it's just it's just to show it's a joke. I've been doing that for years

[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:08.500]
I use those words because the more you use the words it makes them renders the meaningless. It's a joke. It's a show

[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.740]
Oh, yeah, we're going to understand SPIC that's supposed to be Spanish people in charge

[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:20.880]
And I thought to myself boy you talk about paranoia you talk about thin skinned humorless very sad

[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.560]
So anybody who might boy watching that show with our usual one-shier or zero zero wavy line

[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.040]
I hate to break the news deal, but you better lighten up and get a goddamn sense of humor

[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.860]
I mean when's the last time I ever had a call on this show from a black list during we have many by the way

[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.160]
Complaining about sparts or cool. They they it's a joke. It's lingo. It's fun

[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:44.600]
Because if you see there are words like that row of that anti-semite that called me last Thursday or Friday

[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:50.020]
There was a kept repeating the word kike over and over again. There's certain words that go beyond the point of being fun

[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:56.200]
That you can't like nigger you can't say nigger. There's nothing fun about that. Although you don't say the n word

[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.600]
I mean we know if you say the n word it's nigger we can actually say but it's a very nasty mean spirited hostile work

[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:06.480]
And the same with kike there's no way that kite can be like a funny word if you want to say hebe yid

[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.100]
So let's kind of make the determination right now

[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.800]
Let's draw the battle lines for the word and I'm trying to think SPIC to me is not that bad of a word

[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.320]
If I say George is a little SPIC what's wrong with that? That's exactly accurate. He's a little SPIC

[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:25.980]
Now vulgaron that's another story. I know I'm serious. I think like that's yours. Huh? No vulgaron

[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.620]
like nigger and uh and kike and vulgaron

[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:34.500]
Faggot I say use the baggett I say use that word all the time some people used to think oh that's very offensive

[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.980]
You can't call gay people faggot. Oh, why the hell not what's wrong with that

[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.740]
Because after you're at the 10 millionth time it doesn't make it so so grotesque anymore

[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.980]
much farther I think farch is a fun word. What's wrong with that?

[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.720]
Well, like Sammy so say he's from the Dominican Republic. What's wrong with that

[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.780]
But SPIC I mean people that would be offended and go rushing to turn it off because they're oh gee

[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.980]
That's offensive to me. He's a bigot because I said little SPIC

[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:07.160]
Jesus grow up and get a life all you hulios out there all you vulgaron and madacons

[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.120]
Jesus Joseph and uh

[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:11.660]
And oscar

[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.640]
Man all man of shepherds

[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.580]
All these uptight people who just don't get it or don't want to get it refuse to get a life

[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.700]
Who are looking and of course that fits right in with this town anyway people looking to be offended

[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.880]
Oh, that's for your offensive to me. I'm offended. Yeah, right great

[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.900]
Go get a life. Are we on inform iris today by the way? We don't know we don't know

[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.820]
If there's anybody listening on wwwcn and for myers call us what

[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.500]
We are

[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.400]
Joseph's we are how come we weren't on what is it?

[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.800]
Yes, we are that's what I thought you said the first six time excuse me for stepping on you Joe

[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:53.440]
We'll take the footprints off because there might be evidence and we don't want the can star to go uh, you know

[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.240]
Dusting Joe's body for prince

[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:02.880]
I mean anybody who can't see through the political motivation of this whole thing and is salacious pornographic report

[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.560]
Which was totally unnecessary

[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.780]
Not one word that had to be in there sure it had to be in the other uh because he's trying to prove a point if that's what he was trying to do

[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.500]
Trying to refute the president's

[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.820]
Comments about not having sexual relationship or whatever now in his testimony

[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:22.580]
That's fine, but not in a pavement report. That's gonna be uh released all over the world unless of course you're trying to

[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:27.140]
Embrace and humiliate and how and somebody out of office which is what this has been all about right from the beginning

[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.220]
And

[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:35.100]
I still don't understand how come we hear almost nothing about I'll tell you some of the stuff that's really interesting

[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:42.420]
And yeah, I didn't read the whole 445 pages or the 72 page reply or the 42 page second reply

[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.640]
But I read through the summaries, okay

[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:52.420]
Having learned that you would not be able to return to the White House miss Lewinsky sought the president's help in finding a job in New York City

[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.020]
This is after they transferred her to the Pentagon because she was hanging around to make a pest out of herself and people in the White House

[00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.260]
They're saying get that bitch out of here

[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.660]
The president offered a place around the United Nations after initial enthusiasm

[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:09.880]
Is Lewinsky cooled on the idea of working after you win and she prodded the president to get her with job in the private sector

[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.900]
According to Miss Lewinsky the president telephoned her to approximately 2 to 2 30 a.m. On Friday, October 10th

[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.280]
According to Miss Lewinsky the president said if I had known what kind of person you really were

[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.140]
I wouldn't have gotten involved with you

[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:28.020]
He reminded Miss Lewinsky that she had earlier promised if you just want to stop doing this. I'll be no trouble

[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.680]
Miss Lewinsky said she challenged the president

[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.560]
Tell me when I've caused you trouble the president responded

[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:39.220]
I've never worried about you have never been worried you would just do something to hurt me which goes to show you how full as she was right then

[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:45.960]
A scorned petulant bitch. Oh the job and he went wasn't good enough for Monica just like Linda trip or what's your name?

[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.840]
The other one I wanted to be an ambassador Kathleen Willie

[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:56.300]
Yeah, how about ambassador to Ireland at George Mitchell? He don't know too much. How about me? That sounds good. Yeah. Okay, Kathleen you're qualified

[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.920]
Crazy crazy women try to bring down the government of this country and all these sanctimonious hypocrites

[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:09.180]
I like to term an Alan Dersher what's used over the weekend sexual McCarthyism and of course now everybody else is using that too

[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.540]
But that's exactly what this is which hunts

[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.860]
Just like Joe McCarthy in the 50s. It's the same crap here in the 90s again, but guess what it ain't working too good

[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.040]
Because most people when they look in the mirror and they think about their own activities

[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.340]
And they question would I like to have all of my own stuff that I've been covering up

[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:30.040]
On the internet all over the world. I think the answer very clearly is no. No, thank you

[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.340]
And if I lied about these things most people would say how you bet

[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.860]
Because everybody wants to cover their tracks and cover their ass

[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.900]
Cover their back room. That's right

[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:46.700]
And that's what this is all about you can Haka trying to go about purge re and let me say it again lying under oath is not purge re

[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:52.180]
And I y'all if you've been listening and reading it's it's very clear that there's a big difference there

[00:20:54.220 --> 00:21:01.420]
A witch hunt trying to a Honda guy out and quite frankly I am sick and frickin tired of it absolutely headed up to my ears

[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:07.320]
I think we ought to take a poll this morning since it is Monday. Don't you think a poll would be good in this audience?

[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.140]
Oh

[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:10.200]
God

[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.200]
Man oh man. Don't ever stick one of those in men's toes in your puts unless you're serious. That's what he should have told Monica

[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:21.260]
Let's find out how many people in this audience think that Clinton should resign or be impeached

[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:26.660]
Maybe centred but stay in office or just stay in office without any bull crap or maybe just can't stand the whole thing all together

[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.320]
We should never hurt another word about this. Let's find out five six seven oh five sixty

[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.300]
Five sixty on the mobile one line

[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:37.060]
We'll take a little a poll for an hour hour and a half see how it goes here with this crowd if there's any interest whatsoever

[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.340]
Which there might not be knowing this audience

[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:47.560]
Here's a also want to find out fire reports from people of the season ticket holders with the panthers who got to see the arena on Saturday for the first time

[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:52.360]
Which I've already seen it three times. Thank you and how they were impressed with it and it's set up and so on

[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.860]
And what they really got to see Saturday since I didn't waste my time going over there again

[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.460]
Here's a mobile in pompano. Hello

[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.720]
Okay, sir

[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.740]
Yeah, okay great

[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.380]
Here's a mobile in the gold. Hello

[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.580]
Mobile in ghouls

[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.880]
No good morning sir

[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.820]
Speak to me sir. Yes

[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:26.080]
Listen you're wonderful like the greatest morning. Yeah, just like any day right you should be celebrating today

[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.100]
We had a good weekend. We have family family. Yeah

[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.160]
We also have the Michigan

[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.980]
No, Michigan boy, did they take it right up the old

[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.140]
I love it

[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:40.720]
Oh, I'll tell you one thing that Tommy Brady the Michigan quarterback he can play in my team any day

[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.940]
Any day and I scored Tommy boy to and of course the final score

[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:49.160]
It pisses me off is that you know 38 seven and it winds up 38 28 because they stop playing Jim Man

[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.600]
It's I don't think you'll ever see him again

[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.920]
Yeah, that's right

[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:58.020]
Michigan State waps to hell out of Notre Dame 45 23 and I scored Spartan

[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.500]
Because they weren't playing in South Bend no touchdown Jesus. That's right

[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.160]
Because they weren't playing in Notre Dame and they forgot to bring the shrouded to rim with them

[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.940]
But hey, there's more important things going on in football aren't there no. I'm sorry

[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:16.260]
Here's Miami. Hello. Yo, Neil. Yes, sir. I think people need to stop just in the the president because

[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.200]
Ain't nobody is saying especially in those bachelors of my capital here. Yeah

[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.480]
Yeah, just like you said it a couple weeks ago, man

[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.160]
Let him stay man. He's doing a good job. No matter who he's blowing or who he's blowing or whatever

[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.220]
I knew okay, man God bless you sir. There you go. There's our first vote

[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.100]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on our mobile one line

[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.220]
Resignor being peach sent your butt stay in office just stay and leave in the hell alone

[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.620]
Or you just can't stand this anymore and you wish that it would go away and never heard another word of it

[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.540]
And he wish that Ken star when they would pack him up and send him a Siberia

[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.920]
Here's Miami. Hello

[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.400]
Hello, yes, sir. Yeah, yeah, I think that

[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.020]
They should stop playing around with Bill Quinn and leave the man alone

[00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:03.420]
Uh, it was this Monica the wind. You know, on who decided to go down on the man and

[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:10.180]
If she would have respected the office of the president, she would have had no part of it if she would have respected his orifice

[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:14.340]
Very man very well said you got to respect the president's orifice. That's for damn sure

[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.700]
Anybody out there know what kind of cigar it was? No, that's what next wants though. Can you imagine if it wasn't in men?

[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.040]
So

[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:26.760]
Really knowing that Monica known what a jeb she is and all the experience she's got and how come we don't hear any more about Monica

[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.960]
How come we don't hear about all these illegal leaks from Ken star?

[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:34.020]
It's really interesting these selective journalism that's being practiced by all the networks on here

[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.460]
selective journalism

[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.660]
Just tell us whatever the hell they feel they want to tell us and all the rest of the stuff well

[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:45.960]
That's not important the fact that Ken stars brick all these laws taking all the secret. I hear you sends these boxes over there

[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.960]
This is all top secret

[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:52.920]
And even that little faggot david candle the president's attorney, you know with which one I'm talking about the little mincing david candle

[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:58.340]
Even he said the reason we were able to come out with that rebuttal so soon is because of all the illegal leaks that were all over town

[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.660]
Days hours before the report came out on Friday at two o'clock

[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:08.340]
See it's okay for illegalities by the special prosecutor the independent council

[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.260]
But if the president's in the ural office getting low jobs

[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.940]
How do that come out like low job? That's how came out

[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.620]
1027 at 560 wqa and there's nothing is important your business is your copy machine

[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:25.800]
You need to copy or that's right for your needs dependable and doesn't cost your business a fortune and arm in four legs

[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.300]
If these things are important. He won't give our friends a copy corpical

[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.760]
This is a bunch of who

[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.740]
And is so called I mean this is supposed to be a document after all these month dollars and there's all this here say crap in there

[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:44.480]
About the the testimony of Monica's girl friends who came and said oh well Monica said this and

[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.740]
Monica said that the president said this and

[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:52.900]
Unbelievable like the thing about Hillary leaving the not one time that they ask her about that

[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.320]
But the friends of Monica oh yeah, well he allegedly told Monica that uh

[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:04.400]
And Monica told them that he told Monica that he was considering when he got out of the White House

[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.840]
So he might be living the Hillary and who knows what happened and they'll run off in the sunset etc and so on

[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.140]
That's like third fourth-hand information, but that's in there

[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:18.040]
Which of course is real nice for the family and everything else like that. Hey, I have no consideration about any of that

[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:25.580]
Because we have to embarrass and humiliate and the degrade as much as possible and see if it works. Did it work so far? No, it's not like it to me

[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.280]
Here's Boka hello

[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.560]
Uh deal. I think it was a mod be crystal by that anyway. Was it yeah

[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.780]
You guess who this is they should see how many there are left and I could count the mighty crystal

[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.800]
Yeah, right who is this this is begging for Boka. Oh my

Yeah, a long time. Huh? How you doing? Okay. I'm kind of educating

[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.560]
I hear you listen. I think that if the stars stop markets keep going up

[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:55.720]
We keep the president and if it goes down we get it out. Oh, okay. Thanks, but you don't call us again

[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:00.920]
We have an open line indeed one in Broward. Isn't that how we ever survived without him five six seven oh five sixty

Maybe or maybe the ordinary is the ice princess

[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.640]
I bet she is

[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:24.040]
Listen man, the guy needs a resign. He's done nothing but lie to us the whole way through and you know what maybe

[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:29.940]
Well, maybe we just need to put up a pen on how by the east wing and and throw it up with concubine playing out his horse

[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:34.460]
Uh-huh. That'd be a good idea. Okay. Thank you. Okay. We have an open line in day one of Broward

[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.060]

Papa he's done nothing but lie to us

[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.400]
About having extra marital affairs nobody lies about that. Do they know you bet nobody would do that

[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.180]
They get right up there and TV and say I did it was good or she was there with the worst head I ever had in my life

[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.380]
Here's a mobile in uh fort Myers. Hello

[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:54.700]
Hello, yes, sir

[00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:01.620]
Hi, I'm calling to say that I agree totally with you Neil. I'm a first time policy show

[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:06.560]
I don't think the president has done any more than what any other man has done

[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.700]
It's simple. Yeah, I yeah, I'm proud of the bitch who was willing to give him some head

[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:15.800]
He told her what she wanted in here. Hey, he started to get caught. He lied to cover it up

[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.740]
No big deal. He's on a great job in office leave them alone

[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:26.400]
The only bad part is their air in his 30 laundry all over the goddamn world. Yeah, that's the worst part about

[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.600]
Yeah, if she would have just claimed her dirty laundry wouldn't have to be gone through any of this

[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.940]
That's right. You know, I mean this bitch she knew what she was doing

[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.760]
She knew that this was the president if it weren't for the stain on address. He wouldn't have to can

[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:43.980]
All right, all right well said sir. I said he's screwed around is what he said something like that

[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:49.520]
You can't say that word and for Myers Canyon. Oh, don't say the effort over there. They'll show you're asking the who's go

[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.640]
By the way, you see George Wallace is dead. Uh-huh. Okay. We have an open line and then

[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:54.620]
why

[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.380]
What are you going like that for? Yeah, don't you don't isn't it kind of interesting though?

[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:04.280]
How a lot of these right wingers like very gold water, you know, his last many years all of a sudden he came

[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:11.580]
Totally different views and attitudes and George Wallace after those early many many years that ugly racism and hatred and bigotry

[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:16.640]
After all of a sudden he found himself in the chair. He found the lord and he repented and the settlement so on

[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.280]
And by the time he died, he said hey, he never stole a freight train

[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.700]
Kind of interesting, isn't it?

[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.880]
Maybe Kenneth star will have a breakfast and maybe whoever's chance to repent, huh?

[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.460]
To be contrite

[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:36.020]
For all this will this pornography that he put out and then all these people are saying oh, well, what do we tell the kids?

[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.080]
Well, if you're worried about the kids and how come I was in there in the first place

[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.540]
Why did that stuff need to be in their in graphic?

[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.680]
Grotesque detail

[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.980]
Why did that need to be a met particular report when it got 17 other cartons of stuff that they could have

[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:54.320]
You know kept under lock and key and deliberated amongst themselves and read all the titillating parts and said oh god

[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.120]
That's interesting

[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:01.080]
According to Ms. Lewinsky they kissed she was wearing a long dress that buttoned from the neck to the ankles

[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.620]
And he unbuttoned my dress and he unhooked my bra

[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.580]
And he sort of took the dress off my shoulders and moved to bra

[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:11.740]
He was looking at me and touching me and telling me how beautiful I was he touched your breast and touched your genders

[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.720]
She performed or all sex on him

[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.300]
I'm March 31st 1996 and a hallway by the stud to the president and Ms. Lewinsky kiss

[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.100]
I want occasion to coin him as Lewinsky

[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:26.840]
He focused on me pretty exclusively kissing her bare breast and fondling her genitals at one point the president inserted

[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.660]
They cigar into Ms. Lewinsky's vagina then put the cigar in his put in his mouth

[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.420]
I don't know oh

[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.960]
God oh jeez

[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.900]
Man oh man. I think you guys was right. I must have been a swisher sweet

Yeah, I'm out of time and I'll bet that's 50% of the people in Congress have had

[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.320]
Examiles look there okay

[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:01.780]
Well, we're gonna check with Barney Frank on that too by the way. We have an open line in Berk. What do you hear that?

[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:10.880]
Well, that's a good sign that I mean it's construction going on somewhere this building is really doing devil work across the hall one of the other

Not in sex life. Yeah, how about that? Why don't you step in and find this illegal

[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.100]
Step in and do what?

[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.700]
And start this cigar

[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.460]
Okay, have a great day. I have no idea what she said

[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:10.200]

[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:14.380]
I bet you they investigate kids stars like the probably fine. I mean

[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:26.740]
Amen. Yeah, okay. Thank you so much. By the way, guess who I saw last night was it on the 60th minute thing

[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.960]
What you thought was boring. I thought 60 minutes was pretty good

[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:32.240]
Especially Andy Eluni. He was almost funny with those eyebrows. He was great

[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.960]
But they had father drying in on there my good old friend five. What?

[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.920]
What are you laughing about when I used back in the days when I used to have guests on the show

[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.000]
We stand him on the phone all the time father Robert Drine and the greatest priest in the world

[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.860]
Yeah, I was really great when uh, who was doing that when he looked at father dry in the eye my qualifier thing and said

[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.180]
You're helping all the boy

[00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:00.060]
On a Catholic and just as liberal as he was in those days. He was great last night

[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:05.360]
I scored father drining. I was wondered back in those days. How come we had a priest in the congress? Oh, he was great

[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.300]
Father drining. He was I say father drining for president. That's why I say old Bobby drining

[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:17.260]
What are we doing about that problem by the way? I'm moving. I alerted the media, but uh you alerted what the upstairs people

[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.940]
Yeah, so we're holding our breath

And it's a I guess a pretty good likeness of us, but this is definitely not Monica and ill president

[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:58.680]
I don't think he's got a body like that does anybody out there think the prime president's got a body like no

[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.720]
I don't think so what are you looking at that you're not gonna put that

[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.600]
Come on

[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.700]
Watch out a little bit for Christ sakes

[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:11.620]
Get those little spits all worked up that'll keep them on air all those very offended people out there that are up

[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.300]
Tighten no sense of humor. Oh, he said spict Spanish person in charge

[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.400]
I'm gonna tell you when I hear stuff like that it makes me wonder

[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.280]
I mean if you've got any life at all you have any sense of humor whatsoever just a little teeny tiny one no

[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.680]
Here's a mobile in West Palm Beach hello

[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.320]
Yeah, how you doing now? Okay, sir? You know what the report for all that's the biggest crime of mall

[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.880]
I just cannot even believe the press that we paid for that

[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:39.280]
But you know what they left on the report is that earlier in the evening see he sat on his cigar cutter

[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.460]
And he was thinking afterwards gonna have us a garamage. We'll get it cut now

[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.100]
Get it ready. Yeah, and it was out of the report

[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:55.620]
Okay, and those are got okay. Okay. We have an open line of bar 567 05 60 pound five 60 on the

[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.140]
AT&T wireless line

[00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:02.040]
Here's a lady in the Evan Tura hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am. How are you great?

[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:10.000]
I'm reading all of this regarding the president. I think the president is the victim and not she yeah

[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:15.460]
In what's in what sense I feel that she is over 21

[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:21.700]
She knew what she was doing. Yes, and she could have stopped the immediate place

[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.340]
She didn't want to stop it. She's the one who may have said that

[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:29.620]
But now but now she decided it's since I guess I don't know what went on

[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:34.360]
But he must have said that I'm not leaving my wife and this that's the other thing

[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:39.480]
So she has it she became very vindictive. Yeah, although she was demanding intercourse

[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.120]
You wanted a full sexual relation

[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:45.340]
I'm talking about this whole affair and one has

[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:51.200]
Has what she brought on and all of this and I mean maybe I'm

[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:57.180]
Difference than most of the calls that you've been getting in most of the public and most my opinion

[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.900]
But I feel the tea was just as culpable

[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.880]
as he and

[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:08.420]
I mean, I just feel she should have walked away at the very answer

[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.160]
So let's impeach Monica

[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.180]
But I don't I don't know he foolish in what he did

[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:20.240]
But I I mean he is coming out smelling like a rose for the seat

[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:25.340]
And I found what he said. Okay. Thank you. Okay. We have an open line in say more like tuna

[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:32.460]
Open line at day five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the 18t wireless line. Here's the lady in Miami Beach hello

[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:39.600]
Hello, yes, ma'am. So that's how are you? I am okay. I agree completely with the previous lady

[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:45.280]
Yes, the whole thing first of all Clinton of course should stay it's a bloodless

[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:53.100]
Uh, who did the hot the tar which was planned by Republicans and the right wing religious

[00:37:54.340 --> 00:38:04.560]
Movement and they are staying behind it and paying it and star is their puppet. Yeah, why he goes so vigorously after Clinton

[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:11.420]
Monica is the one who initiated it and especially since she saved their dress

[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:20.340]
This post that she wanted to go after him the whole thing is a mockery. It's a shame that Americans should fall for it

[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:26.460]
I'm not falling for it. Yeah. I only hope they have enough brains if there should be a backlash

[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:31.260]
I am a very peaceful person, but I even thought there should be demonstrations

[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:37.060]
Against star he should be fired or at least put him on death row anyway just to show that we mean business

[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:43.640]
This is unheard of with the mockery below any dignity. This should be a little document

[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:49.840]
People are out of their minds who are supporting this. Okay. That's all I have thank you so much

[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.480]
Yeah, it's either and right in the report in fact if you do read much of it

[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.540]
Which I've read this enough to make me sick to my stomach

[00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:00.160]
But if you read it it's like reads like this thing from the star that I've been reading you

[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.700]
That's why I love this should come as no surprise

[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:06.800]
I mean we had that on e here like three four weeks ago about the cigar and all that business and the stuff and here about

[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:13.900]
Well, uh, hella rethought that he she thought hella re was uh the ice princess and he was gonna leave her and yada yada yada

[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.840]
And it's all right in here in the star. That's what it reads like

[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.040]
all the ramblings of a star struck bimbo of a of a slug

[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:26.120]
And yet for some strange reason the media in reporting all of this they've had all the stuff since uh

[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:31.380]
two old one on friday they just they gloss right over that just doesn't come out from their lips

[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.600]
And I'll tell you it's so easy to see which of these is so-called reporters and journalists

[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:41.240]
What what they got in their minds got pally on cbs total lunatic

[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:48.700]
Uh, of course sam and kooky on abc forget about them and like I said the abc polls everybody else's pool show his popularity is a

[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:53.420]
His not popularity personally, but his job approval rating 66 64 percent

[00:39:53.940 --> 00:40:00.420]
Not abc because abc's got a whole spread. They let the sand domelson's answering the phone. Okay one vote for you two for me

[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.040]
And that's how his votes go

[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:05.780]
I mean with the n George Willis in there writing all the reports out

[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:12.260]
But it's real interesting how selectively they report all of this and nothing about monica and her motives

[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:17.020]
And how she was the one who was flirting and this is her own testimony now just like from star magazine

[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:25.200]
What a what a shock that she was flirting with a guy who's uh can't keep his pants zipped up in the first place

[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.540]
And that something actually happened and continue to go on

[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.940]
And that what a shock that two adults lied about it

[00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:37.950]
At least until somebody finally said hey, you know that the stained dress you got

[00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:46.410]
Here's Miramar hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. I've it. Listen. I love you show. All right. Yeah, I'd like them to leave Bob alone leave Bob alone

[00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:51.390]
But my biggest problem. Yes, is this tea the way in which congress

[00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:57.950]
Send this this pornography on the and a public domain like the internet

[00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:59.390]
I think

[00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:06.690]
Every voter common November. Yes, so check with their representative see how they voted and show hold and

[00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:09.030]
Reprimand them at the ballot. It is Marley

[00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:11.210]
What congress did on Friday

[00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:17.850]
I we didn't have to know the details the star report should have gone to congress with just the 11 alleged

[00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:24.230]
point frame peach men right and let's say the details for the privacy of the congress right public enough to hear all that amen

[00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:25.270]
It is Marley

[00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:29.350]
For what congress did and I think every vote in America should

[00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.490]
Personally, reprimand them at the ballot

[00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:38.070]
Okay, thank you so much my friends thank you. I didn't even make good porno

[00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:41.610]
That's the sad part of it especially knowing that the two of them were involved in it

[00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:47.470]
We have an open line in Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line

[00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:53.330]
Here's Miami. Oh, it's all hyped up about the record and so side McGuire

[00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:58.530]
What they really think to see is will build clear to his record ever be broken and screwed in on an wild

[00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:04.230]
That's not even he's not even close to the Kennedy's he's not in the same league. He's like in the little leagues

[00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:06.670]
Yeah, but they didn't get a couple as much as he's getting in trouble

[00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:10.090]
That's that's right because the media then was keeping her nose out of their pants

[00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.010]
Yeah, but now I have nothing else to do in life just

[00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:15.370]
To worry about him. Okay. Okay. Have a great day, amigo

[00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:22.490]
We have an open line in day five. Do you say amigo 5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line

[00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:26.890]
We don't have anybody out there who's uptight upset doing no you bet we don't

[00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:30.190]
They understand it's a radio show. Don't they know come on

[00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.930]

You know, I gotta tell you nice job on Michigan by the way Saturday

[00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:51.210]
And my opinion is changing by the second nice job on Saturday, baby

[00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:52.690]
Take their ass

[00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:55.370]
But anyway

[00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.770]
Who

[00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:04.190]
Why is it they get the teams they shouldn't be and they lose the teams

[00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:08.710]
Don't worry about that. That's not important. You beat Michigan. That's the thing that's important

[00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.350]
You took 10 years off man is his life

[00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:17.790]
Feel I want to tell you I love your show and I especially love your TV show because you get to see all the

[00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:24.370]
The mannerisms and and the nuances of your your show and all the faces you make to the colors and the George everybody

[00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:29.570]
I got to tell you paranoid about that show because I noticed that every time like if I have a scratch like on my lip or like I cut my show

[00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:32.710]
I nick myself shaving yesterday and it looks like I'm either picking my nose

[00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:37.490]
You know, they they purposely shoot these real. I'm flattering angles to make it look like I'm even more of a proberth

[00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:40.570]
And I really am which is not easy. They're trying to cherry it down

[00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:44.450]
Neil because you're trying to knock me down because they can't stand the truth that bag is very good

[00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:47.970]
He don't know for the truth. He's busy putting Rocky at your re on there

[00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:53.330]
You know, hey posse USA. I know what he's looking for. That's right regarding the Clinton situation. Yeah

[00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:57.710]
His sexual out of theory. He don't look so good anymore. I know him. Yeah, go ahead

[00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:03.210]
Is sexual escapades have nothing to do with the way he runs this office? Yeah, I ran it

[00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:07.550]
I won't want to be his daughter or son or his wife, but as far as the president

[00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:11.610]
Well, wait a minute. Let me ask you this. Okay, when you say I know the wife part I can understand

[00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:20.650]
But when you say daughter or son how many daughters and sons in America do you think how many millions of daughters and son know that one or both of their parents are screwing around on the side?

[00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:26.470]
Uh probably a lot, but it's not smeared all the hand raising all over the building

[00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:29.650]
Probably a lot, but it's not smeared

[00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:33.910]
Oh, you know, I'll be talking about the embarrassment factor right? I'm talking about yeah

[00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:39.510]
And I will come and how come Kenneth star didn't consider that how much damage he could do

[00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:45.170]
These people have already been humiliated and embarrassed. How come he didn't consider that have a little bit of decency for the family

[00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:50.050]
I put in all this extravagance crap in there so that Chelsea could read about it at school and all her friends

[00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:50.770]
Etc

[00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:56.250]
Because people are concerned with how much money they can make and how much uh world recognition they can

[00:44:56.250 --> 00:45:01.230]
And how much how quickly they can push his ass out of the oh wow the oral office. That's right. Yes

[00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:07.010]
Meal I gotta say one more thing about uh and you're gonna hate to hear this but about it's about Dan LeBass third

[00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:10.270]
Yeah, he's now working for ESPN

[00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:12.650]
Doing what?

[00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:15.350]
What if he decoken Cuban?

[00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:21.570]
I believe I'm gonna win 11 games. No, sorry. I

[00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:26.850]
Think he's uh, he's just doing like little uh, I'm sight interviews with football players and stuff

[00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.770]
I just saw him this weekend on a football show sniffing around the locker room

[00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:33.970]
That's a good place for that's the way they say it in Syracuse they say you know come on

[00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:37.590]
See what's with these people please don't give you please

As you see K.S

[00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:35.810]
ah

[00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:08.710]
We don't know anything, we're told because we don't know all

[00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:12.970]
Don't brush our teeth, don't come out here, we don't even wear clothes

[00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:17.310]
We're not gonna make you crazy with our bike when part six falls

[00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:21.550]
I'm a monkey or a monkey, she's a monkey, he's a monkey, where are all monkeys now?

[00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:25.830]
We're not well-mattered, we'll be hateful, just love to drop straw

[00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:29.970]
Well don't run, run, run, run, make you laugh until we are bad

[00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:34.330]
Then we'll lay down scratch our bikes and watch you turn red

[00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:38.650]
I'm a monkey or a monkey, she's a monkey, she's a monkey, where are all monkeys now?

[00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:42.990]
We wouldn't want to be a dog that can't enforce our cow

[00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:47.550]
We're smelly and we like it and we've heard the things you said

[00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:51.610]
Don't come with me, be hateful, just love me, we'll live on your head

[00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:55.170]
Oh, I'm a year of age, I'm a year of age, I'm a year of age now

[00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:58.330]
I'm a year of age, I'm a year of age, I'm a year of age now

[00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:01.750]
We're in 32 trees, we're in 3 messed up chainshow

[00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:04.150]
Counties, dots, I've got 50 as well

[00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:07.790]
We're all wild now

[00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:13.830]
We're in 152, the next next up 28th World Market's world

[00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:17.670]
We're all up today even down the line in America because they don't want to tie to this crap

[00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:21.450]
And when the report came out, they breed a collective sigh of relief and said

[00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:24.250]
Oh, that's all it is, we'll screw that, let's go buy some stocks

[00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:29.870]
Two open lines in date, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 6, the uneocteenth-year wireless line

[00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:32.970]
If we had one spy report from the Panther season ticket holders

[00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:34.990]
Who saw the new arena for the first time yesterday?

[00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.410]
No

[00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:39.290]
If we had anybody who went over there to see you to grab their seat with a report?

[00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:39.650]
No

[00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:42.730]
Here's the Coral Springs, hello

[00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.990]
Morning, young man

[00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.330]
Yes, sir

[00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:47.870]
I'm so emotionally spent from the Cubs game yesterday, though

[00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:48.570]
Oh, wasn't that great?

[00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:49.650]
Oh, my God

[00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:51.750]
I mean, those two are

[00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:53.710]
What about those cheegos?

[00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:55.450]
Number 62

[00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:58.510]
And who are the big back you got to put it?

[00:48:58.610 --> 00:48:59.230]
How do you like that?

[00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:00.790]
And we're still a game ahead of them, man

[00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:01.230]
Yeah

[00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:02.250]
Oh, it's just wonderful

[00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:02.790]
What a series

[00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:05.950]
Three-game series, 72 runs scored over the weekend

[00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:09.170]
The Cubs and the Brewers and every game both teams had over 10 runs

[00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:10.270]
Magnificent

[00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.950]
Yeah, it was great

[00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:13.470]
Neil, I got to say something about Clinton

[00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:17.570]
I haven't got much to add, your crawlers have been pretty articulate this morning

[00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:18.930]
Probably because they're so pissed off

[00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:20.870]
I'm pretty pissed off too

[00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:23.930]
It's obvious that all he

[00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:25.910]
started trying to do was be punitive

[00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:27.950]
And it's part of this new

[00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:28.530]
sexual

[00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:31.890]
prudery that we have in this country

[00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:35.530]
And he shouldn't reason he's not going to be impeached

[00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:36.410]
But unfortunately

[00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:39.470]
I'm a little pissed off at him because he's given

[00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:40.510]
these

[00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:44.470]
these right-wing Republicans a little more

[00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:46.290]
entrants into our government

[00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:47.670]
That's it

[00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:48.170]
Okay

[00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:51.210]
Okay, we have an open line and date one at

[00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:55.090]
Brad 5.6705.60.506.60 on the 18T wireless line

[00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:56.730]
No conversation from the media

[00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:57.870]
I mean they did a little bit

[00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:01.410]
They had that one excerpt from a dark side of Kamalat by C. Moore's

[00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:02.230]
Few nights ago

[00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:04.350]
But other than that there's a very little mention

[00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:06.350]
Anymore about all the other stuff that's gone on

[00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:08.470]
Orges at the pool with the Kennedys

[00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:11.350]
Orges in a hotel rooms on every campaign stuff

[00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:13.650]
Orges at hotels every time they made a trip

[00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:14.430]
During his presidency

[00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:17.390]
Nobody cared about that because everybody kept their mouth shut

[00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:21.750]
And now that now it's interesting that after all that stuff is coming out to you hear

[00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:24.950]
Anybody saying oh my gosh these people were perverts

[00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:26.370]
They weren't fit to be a president

[00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:27.150]
They should have resigned

[00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.510]
No

[00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.130]
Whether it's eyes now whether it's Roosevelt

[00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:30.990]
Whether it's Kennedy

[00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:34.370]
And we got the you know like I said the same 30% of the people

[00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:36.290]
That hated Clinton like poison from the beginning

[00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:37.250]
They still hate him

[00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.950]
What a surprise

[00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:42.490]
But I encourage since we're doing a very scientific poll here

[00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:44.430]
I want to go out of my way to encourage people

[00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:47.010]
Who would think that he should reside or be impeached to call it in today

[00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:50.550]
I mean I'm not going to argue with the LCD and listen like that one vozo that called before

[00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:53.610]
I'm not going to insult you and call your names like asshole or stuff like that

[00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:57.450]
We've had 11 people uh 10 say that he ought to stay in office and cut the crap

[00:50:57.450 --> 00:50:59.690]
And once that he should resign he's lied to us etc

[00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:01.130]
One vozo said

[00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:03.010]
Here's Miami

[00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:03.410]

[00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:20.470]
Okay

[00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:22.650]
Number one I do feel he should resign

[00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:23.010]
Yeah

[00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:23.590]
Okay

[00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:24.990]
And number two

[00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:29.590]
There I just want to correct the caller who said it was the Republican to vote it to

[00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.670]
Relief

[00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:31.770]
This uh

[00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:33.250]
Oh and most of the Democrats

[00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:36.110]
So here's 60 members of the House

[00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:36.390]
Right

[00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:38.990]
So that means over 130 Democrats

[00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:41.250]
Right that's right and overwhelming majority of all of them

[00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:41.430]
Right

[00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.850]
Exactly

[00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:45.290]
So I just want to correct that point of view because he made it sound like it was just Republican

[00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:46.530]
Absolutely

[00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:47.210]
Correct

[00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:49.770]
Thank you and there's one other thing that really bothered me

[00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:52.050]
But let me ask you something do you think that all of that the

[00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:53.390]
Sexually explicit material

[00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:56.150]
Need to be included that 455 pages

[00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:57.450]
Well I'm gonna make a point here

[00:51:57.450 --> 00:51:58.750]
I'm gonna make a point here

[00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:00.730]
What really bothers me

[00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:01.350]
Yeah

[00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:01.730]
Especially

[00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:04.110]
A Jewish person what really bothers me

[00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:06.190]
Is that the black caucus

[00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:09.010]
The reasons that they didn't want this release

[00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:11.830]
The majority of the Democrats who voted not to release this

[00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:12.070]
Yes

[00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:13.950]
Because they did not like this

[00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:15.390]
Relatious detail

[00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:18.990]
That it was a shame that our children should hear this on the internet

[00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:21.890]
We're in the name of God with these people

[00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:27.910]
When when our women of members of the black caucus has ever said anything about gangster rap

[00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:30.350]
The anti-Semitism coming from that

[00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:31.810]
The anti-white

[00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:33.330]
That's killing the police off us

[00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:33.590]
Yeah

[00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:34.410]
Where were they?

[00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:35.090]
How about now

[00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:37.170]
How do you know that none of them ever said anything about that

[00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:37.590]
I don't understand

[00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:40.050]
Neo believe me they haven't

[00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:41.770]
Not wanted to live in you smart

[00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:43.610]
Did you see that on C-San?

[00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:44.750]
Yeah, grotesque

[00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:46.170]
It was the best thing

[00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:48.850]
Jews are the bloodstuckers of America

[00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:51.150]
Let's kill all white police officers

[00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:53.610]
Where was one member of the black caucus

[00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:54.930]
Where was the per outraged then

[00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:55.270]
Yeah

[00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:57.730]
I mean look at this hypocrisy

[00:52:57.730 --> 00:52:58.170]
Good point

[00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:00.330]
And that's the blood ones that are saying that issue

[00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:01.810]
Why did you think I was gonna scream and shout

[00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:03.010]
Oh I

[00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:05.010]
I wasn't sure

[00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:07.070]
I thought they were reasonable man

[00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:10.150]
Thank you for just agreeing with me on this point

[00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:11.310]
And I do think

[00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:12.810]
All he should resign

[00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:15.710]
So but but let me ask you for getting about the black guy

[00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:16.750]
I understand it for you're making there

[00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:19.270]
But do you think that that all needed to be released on the internet

[00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:22.830]
When it got 17 other cartons of stuff that they're concerned about

[00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:25.530]
May and be a source of embarrassment to other people

[00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:26.910]
Why did they need to be in there

[00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:28.490]
Well your point is

[00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:30.270]
The other 26 pages

[00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:31.590]
They could have left the police

[00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:32.570]
He tells them that

[00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:36.890]
That's basically what she's saying

[00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:38.730]
But as I said before

[00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:41.170]
3653 members voted to release it

[00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:41.430]
Right

[00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:43.250]
So it's Democrats and Republicans

[00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:43.950]
But nobody can do that

[00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:46.170]
Oh there's no question lack of spine on both parties

[00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:47.250]
There's no question about that

[00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:47.790]
Okay

[00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:48.290]
We're right there

[00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:49.090]
Thank you

[00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:51.050]
Okay we have an open line in Broward

[00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:52.430]
5670560

[00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:54.830]
pound 560 on the 18th T wireless line

[00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:56.550]
Here's a lady in Hellendale

[00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:57.110]
Hello

[00:53:57.110 --> 00:53:57.710]
Hey

[00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:58.870]
Hi my own

[00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:00.410]
Yes ma'am sounds just like you

[00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:01.810]
This is one of your dish bags

[00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:03.010]
Regular listeners

[00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:04.370]
From Hellendale

[00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.850]
Yes

[00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:07.170]
We are seniors

[00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:08.690]
And I want to tell you something

[00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:11.370]
We backed our president 100%

[00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:13.570]
Because he is no different

[00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:14.790]
From anybody else

[00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:15.730]
He's a human being

[00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:17.650]
And it was a disgrace

[00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:19.650]
As such of the disgrace

[00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:22.610]
And everybody who I've spoken to feels the same way

[00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:24.810]
And that this should have been released

[00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:26.150]
Whether it was the internet

[00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.930]
Or anything

[00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:29.150]
But I mean it's horrible to prove

[00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:30.590]
Into a person's life

[00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:32.730]
Because that's between him and his wife

[00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:33.250]
Of course

[00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:35.150]
Look whatever I'm saying is a cliche

[00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:36.290]
Already it's old hat

[00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:38.510]
And it's y'all pulled his garbage

[00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:39.630]
And let's go on

[00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:40.770]
And I just want to tell you

[00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:42.330]
We listen to your show every day

[00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:44.750]
We watch you on television at night

[00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:46.610]
There's so much needs to be fixed

[00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:48.010]
For Matt television show

[00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:50.210]
I mean really is

[00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:51.690]
From outer space

[00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:54.290]
I never saw such junk in my life

[00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:54.530]
Yeah

[00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:56.250]
I don't know who they're attracting

[00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:58.310]
I think it's the five and six year old

[00:54:58.310 --> 00:54:59.570]
If anybody is up at that time

[00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:00.750]
The kids are watching cartoons

[00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:01.410]
The ones that watch

[00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:03.210]
And the other show is right

[00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:04.070]
Amongsters

[00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:05.070]
But I'll tell you first

[00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:05.890]
They're digging the little kids

[00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:08.630]
First of all your show should be at least an hour

[00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.970]
Yeah

[00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:10.230]
And I mean

[00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:11.930]
I think it ought to be like four hours

[00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:13.290]
They just ought to take the whole four hours

[00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:14.050]
And stick it on there

[00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:14.630]
Uncounsel

[00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:16.610]
Because the other stuff is such

[00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:18.270]
You know what I'm hoping

[00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:20.650]
We're hoping that one of the other

[00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:21.210]
You know

[00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:23.810]
Stations that is a real station

[00:55:23.810 --> 00:55:25.090]
That's not for make believe

[00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:25.770]
A real

[00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:26.970]
A real TV station

[00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:27.150]
Right

[00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:28.410]
That's what we're thinking

[00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:30.090]
It's fun to do a practice

[00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:31.150]
On an equally

[00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:33.010]
And that's some day a real station

[00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:33.650]
Come along and say

[00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:35.090]
Hey, that's a pretty exciting show

[00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:36.510]
Let's put that guy damn thing down

[00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:37.970]
Exactly, you know you're getting your feet wet

[00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:38.210]
No

[00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:40.850]
And I hope I just hope it blossoms

[00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:41.250]
For you

[00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:42.830]
I don't even know if you want that though

[00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:44.130]
If I want one

[00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:46.670]
I mean would you want to go into something more

[00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:47.710]
You know some of the other

[00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:48.630]
Of the real stations

[00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:49.470]
Oh and yeah

[00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:50.790]
If they could do it the same way

[00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:52.370]
You mean do I want to do any more work

[00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:53.010]
The answer is no

[00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:54.470]
Not at my advanced stage

[00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.970]
Oh

[00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:55.750]
Have a great day

[00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:56.550]
Okay, bye

[00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:56.970]
Thanks

[00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:58.410]
Okay, we have an open line in Brown

[00:55:58.410 --> 00:55:59.470]
Do I want to do any more work

[00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:00.710]
Less work sounds good

[00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:01.010]
Uh-huh

[00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:01.490]
There you go

[00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:03.130]
By the way, George will be on next week

[00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:03.830]
During my vacation

[00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:05.590]
Oh yeah, that's right

[00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:06.450]
We could tell a whole story

[00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:07.250]
About George Binon

[00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:08.790]
Because Dufflinzi and Greg Reed said

[00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:09.550]
He was great

[00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:10.630]
Put him on

[00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.930]
I said okay

[00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:13.110]
Don't start getting

[00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:14.770]
Is not the way it worked

[00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:17.710]
10 minutes after 11 at 5'6'

[00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:18.050]
How

[00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:19.570]
Are you so horny

[00:56:19.570 --> 00:56:20.390]
But thanks to Will

[00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:21.510]
That's the Eric from the tower

[00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:22.750]
And Scott and Keeva Skam

[00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:23.570]
But here's a great facts

[00:56:23.570 --> 00:56:25.270]
From not that their facts is weren't great

[00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:27.110]
But this is really great from Daryl

[00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:28.610]
It said the star report

[00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:30.190]
Had to include all the sexy details

[00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:32.750]
Otherwise a five-page report would look pretty bad

[00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:33.970]
Ha ha ha ha

[00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:36.370]
Yeah, 445 pages of

[00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:38.830]
Slough, smut and slut looks a lot more impressive

[00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:40.050]
Than five pages saying

[00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:41.030]
He didn't do nothing

[00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:43.030]
I mean is there anything

[00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:45.090]
Twice in their dimensions white water

[00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:47.430]
That's the four years and 50 million is now

[00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:48.090]
Not 40 million

[00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:49.410]
Post to 50 million they're saying

[00:56:49.410 --> 00:56:50.810]
That they spent a white water

[00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:52.090]
A 10-year-old land deal

[00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:53.930]
That they indicted these other people on

[00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:54.630]
But could they catch

[00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:56.090]
Bubble or a Hillary on air

[00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:57.370]
No, no one thing

[00:56:57.370 --> 00:56:59.170]
Now one you can bet your bottom dollar

[00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:01.670]
If there was any one shred of inditable evidence

[00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:02.930]
Right there it would have been in the report

[00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:04.570]
Because that's what this report is all about

[00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:05.790]
It's a referral saying

[00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:06.510]
Hey guess what

[00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:08.130]
I think these are all inditable offenses

[00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:10.310]
Even though he of course not the one to make those judgments

[00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:13.170]
These are all impeachable offenses

[00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:15.830]
I say let's impeach Ken star

[00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:16.690]
That's what I say

[00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:19.370]
Let's send him and Janet Wiener to camp

[00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:20.750]
To work to labor camp

[00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:23.350]
Here's the leading Miami B

[00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:23.690]
Chilo

[00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:25.330]
Good morning

[00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:26.010]
Yes, ma'am

[00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.990]
Uh

[00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:31.550]
A lot of your call is like you

[00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:35.490]
Are harping on the sexual aspect of the report

[00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:38.950]
What you've been deliberately leaving out

[00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:40.650]
Is the purged repart

[00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:41.210]
Uh-huh

[00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:43.230]
I talked about it in the beginning

[00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:44.530]
No, you've been leaving that part

[00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:45.010]
No, he did not

[00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:46.750]
I said right in the beginning of the show

[00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:48.450]
That lying under oath is not perjury

[00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:50.410]
Lying to a grand jury

[00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:52.790]
Is an impeachable offense

[00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:53.230]
Uh-huh

[00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:54.610]
And how do you know he lied

[00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:55.810]
He lied to a grand jury

[00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:57.070]
How do I know

[00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:57.650]
Yeah

[00:57:58.210 --> 00:57:59.430]
Are you suggesting that

[00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:02.350]
Star lied in his report

[00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:05.370]
I'm saying that he this is a one-sided report

[00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:09.370]
No, are you suggesting that star lied in his report

[00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:10.550]
I am not suggesting

[00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:14.430]
I am telling you that everything in the report is geared to draw certain conclusions

[00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:16.090]
Yes, that's what I'm telling you

[00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:19.470]
Okay, going to a grand jury is an impeachable

[00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:20.730]
How do you know that

[00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:22.130]
Clinton lied

[00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:23.890]
How do you know it's an impeachable offense

[00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:25.390]
Did you write the constitution

[00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:26.370]
Where does it work

[00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:27.790]
Where does it say that

[00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:29.490]
So many people won't be saying so

[00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:31.190]
So many people with the authority

[00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:33.410]
Would not be saying so if it was a lie

[00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:35.350]
Anyhow, let me continue

[00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:36.370]
No, no, but wait man

[00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:38.930]
How do you know that lying to a grand jury is an impeachable offense

[00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:42.030]
How do you know that that fits the definitions of high crimes and misdemeanors

[00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:43.350]
Oh, well, wait a while

[00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:44.350]
Clinton lied

[00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:45.270]
Not once

[00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:46.230]
Not twice

[00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:48.150]
But the multiple of times

[00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:49.410]
Let me see it to again

[00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:51.670]
The lying is not the same as perjury

[00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:54.430]
What is perjury

[00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:58.750]
Perjury means it has to have the material to the testimony

[00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:02.310]
The testimony that the person gave it a Paula Jones case

[00:59:02.310 --> 00:59:06.590]
The even the presiding judge said that the his testimony in that regard was a material

[00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:08.570]
That portion of it that's being talked about

[00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:12.270]
No, that that's the one material in addition to which the case was thrown out anyway

[00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:13.050]
That's the one case

[00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:14.050]
That is on a penis

[00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:16.410]
And that is the result of that is to come

[00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:16.810]
Yeah

[00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:17.970]
Let's leave that to say

[00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:20.010]
Okay, let's leave that one aside Paula Jones

[00:59:20.010 --> 00:59:20.530]
Right

[00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:21.170]
Yes

[00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:22.370]
So there's nothing

[00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:23.610]
What have been wondering

[00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:27.330]
After Monica played the cigar in the private part

[00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:29.290]
After he stuck it in there, yes

[00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:30.930]
Clinton then put it in his mouth

[00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:31.390]
Yes

[00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:33.050]
With all the

[00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:36.790]
substance from Monica on it

[00:59:36.790 --> 00:59:37.610]
With all the what?

[00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:38.850]
The substance

[00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:39.290]
The substance

[00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:39.850]
Yeah, from

[00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:41.190]
From inside

[00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:42.170]
How do you know the substance

[00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:45.410]
So you think she would put it in the thing and it would come all dry

[00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:47.570]
I don't know

[00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:50.550]
Oh yeah, I guess we got the answer to that

[00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:51.970]
No, let's let's let's go

[00:59:51.970 --> 00:59:53.090]
Yes, so what is that?

[00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:55.970]
So we're going to we're going to we're going to impeach him for a second

[00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:57.250]
Yes, so he said Stogi

[00:59:57.250 --> 00:59:58.370]
Let me speak

[00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:00.530]
So I mean, either you know something

[01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:03.030]
This is the best call we've had today by the way she says

[01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.810]
The impeach

[01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:05.250]
This is the best call we've had today

[01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:06.210]
You are right

[01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:09.990]
The founding fathers did put that in there it's in very small print in the constitution

[01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:13.830]
But it definitely does say smoking a soggy Stogi is grounds for impeachment

[01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:14.730]
You can see what you want

[01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:16.610]
What I'm asking is

[01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:18.230]
Paula Monica

[01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:19.390]
Was that right?

[01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:20.850]
I'm not in the part

[01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.070]
Oh my god

[01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:22.870]
Look how it's not here

[01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:23.790]
No, geez

[01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:25.070]
And he put it in his mouth

[01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:25.990]
I think I said he's

[01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:27.410]
Go home to his wife

[01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:32.150]
And child and kiss them good night with that dirty mouth

[01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:34.970]
Oh he he they got a big bottle of history in there in the oral office

[01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:37.070]
I am not sure what it's called the oral orifice

[01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:37.670]
I'm not sure

[01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:39.450]
No, he's got a big bottle of scope

[01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:40.630]
I am not sure so

[01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:43.390]
In fact, in fact, didn't we get the thing about the scope and the investigation

[01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:44.950]
That's the scope they were talking about

[01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:45.450]
No, no

[01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:46.610]
He used

[01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:48.470]
30 mouth

[01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:49.010]
Yeah

[01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:52.230]
And put more than girls come on the space of his

[01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:53.270]
He loved his wife

[01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.710]
Yeah

[01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:54.270]
And child

[01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:54.790]
Yes

[01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:56.570]
And

[01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:57.910]
Yes, that's all I have to do

[01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:58.470]
Okay, thank you

[01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:59.670]
Okay, I guess she wants him out

[01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:02.390]
Am I overstepping my guests there?

[01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:02.970]
I don't think so

[01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:06.790]
Although did you remember during the Kennedy years all those romantics used to call it Kamalot

[01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:09.630]
And now that we're in the 90s maybe they can call this scandal Kamalot

[01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:10.870]
Instead of Kamalot

[01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:11.350]
What do you think?

[01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:11.930]
Good idea?

[01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:13.930]
Okay, nice going, sweetheart

[01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:15.370]
It was a soggy Stogi

[01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:16.450]
Now we got to about

[01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:18.330]
I mean his Ken star, he missed it up

[01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:19.370]
If you would have just had her

[01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:21.670]
This wonderful articular Jamaican lady

[01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:23.750]
Yeah, I think about those Jamaicans by the way

[01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:24.950]
Those Jamaican women

[01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:28.470]
She's got her finger on the pulse of it right on the tip

[01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:29.050]
That's right

[01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:30.810]
It was a soggy Stogi

[01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:33.170]
And he went home and he kissed Hillary and Chelsea

[01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:36.070]
Right on the lips and he had the essence of monocon is pushed

[01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:38.870]
Oh my God, oh my God

[01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:40.970]
She's

[01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:44.970]
Maybe that's why Hillary keeps her distance

[01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:46.270]
Spends a lot of time out of time

[01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:47.210]
Maybe that's what it is

[01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:48.950]
Oh that's sent of Monica

[01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:52.770]
Here's a lady in my any, hello

[01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:54.570]
Hello

[01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:57.230]
Lady in my any

[01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.930]
Oh yeah

[01:01:57.930 --> 01:01:59.370]
Yes ma'am

[01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:02.310]
Um Monica was just as guilty as the president

[01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:05.650]
Because the president not forced her to do what she did

[01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:06.970]
Oh no, she was the instigator

[01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:07.630]
That's right

[01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:08.370]
She said so

[01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:09.790]
And she didn't have to

[01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:11.670]
She didn't have to keep going bad

[01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:13.990]
She did not have to keep going bad

[01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:15.690]
If she didn't like it

[01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:16.890]
She didn't have to go back

[01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:19.190]
Yeah, one sound like she liked it

[01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.990]
She wanted intercourse

[01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.910]
She wanted the whole deal

[01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:23.390]
Well, I don't think he's guilty myself

[01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:24.430]
Okay, you want to

[01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:25.650]
He's a typical man

[01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:26.670]
He's a horny guy

[01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:27.290]
That's right

[01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:27.910]
Okay, thank you

[01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.870]
Like I said, that's a redundant horny guy

[01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:30.510]
We know that

[01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:33.690]
And I'm really surprised that the women of America

[01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:34.650]
Give him higher remarks

[01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:35.210]
Of course

[01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:37.890]
It's consistent with people's politics anyway

[01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:39.110]
Because he got more votes from women

[01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:39.970]
Than he got from men

[01:02:39.970 --> 01:02:41.810]
So I guess it's just a lot of hard-ass men

[01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:42.710]
Who are hypocrites

[01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:46.030]
I think if he would have been doing attractive women

[01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:46.890]
I think the men of America

[01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:48.350]
Probably give him like real high marks

[01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:50.350]
He'd probably be up there in the 80 and 90 range

[01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:51.790]
As far as approval rating from men

[01:02:52.690 --> 01:02:53.730]
Or Jealous and saying

[01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:54.250]
All right

[01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:54.570]
Yeah

[01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:55.470]
It's going air, will he?

[01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:58.210]
But when you're talking about slots like this

[01:02:58.210 --> 01:02:59.310]
I think it's a lot more difficult

[01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:00.850]
Oh, and then one of these congressman

[01:03:00.850 --> 01:03:02.530]
One of these right wingers gets on air last night

[01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:03.090]
And he says

[01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:04.190]
Well, you know, it's a lot different

[01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:05.910]
I mean Kennedy was a Merlin Monroe

[01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:07.870]
And he was a 21-year-old intern

[01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:09.910]
How do we know the ages of all the

[01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:11.390]
The prostitutes

[01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:13.390]
All the hookers that they used to bring in for the orgies

[01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:14.110]
For the Kennedies

[01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:16.610]
Not only did we know their ages

[01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:17.890]
We didn't even know who the hell they were

[01:03:17.890 --> 01:03:19.970]
The secret service was always having a nervous breakdown

[01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:22.030]
Because they had no idea who these women were

[01:03:22.850 --> 01:03:23.650]
German spies

[01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:25.110]
Mafia spy

[01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:26.410]
Who the hell are these people

[01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:26.990]
We don't know

[01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:28.950]
The Kennedies boys are in there

[01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:30.050]
With all their assistants

[01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:31.190]
And they're having a good time

[01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:33.210]
Boys will be boys

[01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:37.570]
And the media still can't accept this

[01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:38.710]
All this is disgusting

[01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:39.590]
It's grotesque

[01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:40.670]
It's the facing

[01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:43.090]
Like this is some kind of a surprise

[01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:46.330]
They try to would a Jennifer flowers thing

[01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:48.230]
That was supposed to get the public's side cut

[01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:50.010]
They try to would a Paula Jones thing

[01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:51.370]
Which by the way it's real interesting

[01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:52.330]
I love these people

[01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:53.770]
Including Anita Hill by the way

[01:03:54.850 --> 01:03:56.850]
All these women who wait for years

[01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:58.390]
And none of us can they come forward say

[01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:59.990]
Oh well, long, guess what

[01:04:00.730 --> 01:04:01.950]
He said kiss it

[01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:05.270]
I would bear my I would bear my

[01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:07.650]
Braco and say kiss that is what I would tell them

[01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:10.010]
How come all of a sudden after all these years

[01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:11.510]
Now you're pissed off and indignant

[01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:14.950]
And how come we got these after after Paula's attorneys

[01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:16.230]
The original ones quick

[01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:17.290]
And walked away

[01:04:17.290 --> 01:04:18.810]
How come he's right wing funded

[01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:19.730]
And turnies all of a sudden

[01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:20.630]
Instead of representing her

[01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:21.110]
And she

[01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:22.910]
Her first TD currents was on with that

[01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:24.390]
Sanctum on his Pat Robertson

[01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:25.450]
On the 700 Club

[01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:27.290]
Who filed it his first child out of wedlock

[01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:28.850]
Who was born 10 weeks after they got married

[01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:30.530]
How come that was

[01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:31.110]
How Paula

[01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:32.090]
With that phony nose

[01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:35.270]
The only thing worse than a phony nose

[01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:36.010]
Is a phony

[01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:38.870]
Anel plug

[01:04:39.590 --> 01:04:40.830]
Oh that thing is really

[01:04:40.830 --> 01:04:42.750]
I'm talking to that's too it's not forgiving

[01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:44.630]
Okay, we're

[01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:45.190]
That's what taking

[01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.890]
Ha ha

[01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:46.770]
It's what

[01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:47.770]
It's for taking

[01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:49.190]
Oh no not for mine

[01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:51.470]
Here's a lady mobile in West Palm Beach

[01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.770]
Hello

[01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:53.430]
I'm Neil how are you

[01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:54.390]
I'm doing great

[01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:57.010]
Good listen I have a question for you before I get to

[01:04:57.010 --> 01:04:58.950]
All this for Costa Clinton stuff

[01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:00.150]
For Costa Craf, you know

[01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:02.990]
Yeah there's a bar down the street for me now

[01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:04.470]
And they painted it bright pink

[01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:06.190]
And it's called Cibio

[01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:07.350]
Sports bar

[01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:08.430]
What does Cibio mean

[01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:09.870]
Cibio

[01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:11.710]
C-I-D-A-O

[01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:14.530]
Well Cibio

[01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:15.810]
Scott bio hangs out there

[01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:16.830]
Oh okay

[01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:18.070]
I have no idea what that means

[01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:19.170]
Lord doesn't know

[01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:20.950]
Is that is that espanyol

[01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.170]
I think so

[01:05:22.170 --> 01:05:22.770]
Cibio

[01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:24.550]
Maybe it's my name

[01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:26.210]
Yeah maybe it's some of Goufals name

[01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:27.050]
Oh well

[01:05:27.050 --> 01:05:28.190]
Anyway um

[01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.690]
I guess

[01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:30.790]
I guess about this Clinton stuff

[01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:31.410]
What I

[01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:35.430]
I really don't want to see a president gore

[01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:37.250]
At all

[01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:37.990]
What's that?

[01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.850]
I

[01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:42.790]
I mean he just seems to be a little bit of a green Nazi

[01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:44.710]
I think

[01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:48.270]
You know I don't know that he would even be that effective or anything

[01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:50.270]
Or have any power but

[01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:52.670]
If they're going to impeach or whatever

[01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:53.710]
If he's going to resign

[01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:56.830]
Hopefully he'll do it before that January 20th

[01:05:56.830 --> 01:05:57.510]
Cutoff

[01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:58.010]
Yeah

[01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:58.950]
So they uh

[01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:59.210]
They're

[01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:01.170]
Well do you think you ought to you think you ought to resign?

[01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:02.750]
Um

[01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:04.930]
You know the line park

[01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:07.270]
I don't know

[01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:09.930]
The line park bothers me all the sexual stuff

[01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:10.570]
I think it's just

[01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:13.070]
It's a bad example that really

[01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:15.330]
If it's the media's fault of painting it

[01:06:15.330 --> 01:06:17.670]
You know all over the place every day

[01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.830]
You know

[01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:19.710]
So what do you think?

[01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:22.030]
But as far as the line park

[01:06:22.550 --> 01:06:23.870]
I think that's pretty bad

[01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:27.590]
But even though a normal any normal man's going to lie

[01:06:27.590 --> 01:06:28.710]
About having an affair

[01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:31.070]
So I don't know

[01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:32.510]
So you don't know you're undecided

[01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:34.850]
Well I just been ready for it to go away

[01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:35.730]
Check of it

[01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:36.630]
You can't stand anymore

[01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:37.110]
Okay, thanks

[01:06:37.110 --> 01:06:38.230]
Have a great day

[01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.770]
You did

[01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:41.950]
Of course uh you know lying about covering up a sexual affair is one thing

[01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:45.330]
Lying about uh you know diverting uh funsy legally to the contras

[01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:46.390]
That was another thing

[01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:47.870]
Reagan should have been impeached for that

[01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:49.090]
Bush should have been impeached for that

[01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:50.150]
Oh we didn't know nothing

[01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.670]
That was the famous line for that

[01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:54.210]
They had nothing to do with that

[01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:54.650]
Remember that

[01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:56.430]
They just uh yeah they

[01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:57.690]
They couldn't remember of course

[01:06:57.690 --> 01:06:58.930]
Reagan can't remember anything now

[01:06:58.930 --> 01:06:59.630]
It's very convenient

[01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:01.030]
All falls under the same category

[01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:03.390]
And of course

[01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:04.830]
Johnson with the Gulf of Tonkin

[01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:05.810]
The light about that

[01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:09.630]
Roosevelt light you know Roosevelt had three separate warnings about Pearl Harbor

[01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:10.850]
You do know that don't you

[01:07:11.650 --> 01:07:16.430]
And the only reason that we sat back and did nothing so that would be a convenient excuse for us to get into the world war two

[01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:19.070]
As you'd already promised Weinstein Churchill

[01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:20.530]
Who also smoked a big stogie

[01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:23.850]
You see the connection between cigars and all of this stuff that's going on in the world

[01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:27.110]
I told you see gars are what makes the world go around

[01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:28.330]
I've been telling you that for a long time

[01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:30.710]
So just pop a big one in your purse

[01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:33.630]
And then go home and give Hillary a big kiss for it

[01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:34.550]
Here's uh

[01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:36.410]
What is it? Parine hello

[01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:39.830]
Hey Neil. I'll set pepper dine. That's a Ken star for you and slip

[01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:41.870]
How you doing today? Great

[01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:46.150]
You just stole my bit right out of my mouth with the conscious thoughts

[01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:49.950]
It's amazing how this country is so shocked by something like this

[01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:53.790]
And when a president in office commits treason by selling weapons

[01:07:53.790 --> 01:07:57.610]
So our enemies who end up using it against us in the Gulf war

[01:07:57.610 --> 01:07:59.770]
I find that amazing. Yeah

[01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:00.650]
It's

[01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:05.370]
I think this thing should just blow away. I'll give one to bother and uh

[01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:08.510]
Let's hope the market stays the way it's going

[01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:15.750]
Up on 170 points the world. I think it's gonna go up to about 250 days. Okay. All right. Have a good day

[01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:20.110]
Okay, sell tomorrow. Okay. We have an open line of date. By the way those Hilton hotels

[01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:24.270]
That's been downgraded because the earnings were like and you want to know why the earnings were way down

[01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:26.530]
Hotel's in Hawaii and uh

[01:08:26.530 --> 01:08:29.310]
California because uh all the uh no more Asian tourists

[01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:31.150]
That's right

[01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:36.630]
And so I say wait another couple of days and then buy Hilton like crazy. Here's gonna be the great

[01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:39.930]
Ha ha like this. Oh buy that Hilton stock like crazy, baby

[01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:45.490]
That's my one shink and my armor. Oh, did he say chink there he goes again next to be saying stick again

[01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:50.030]
Let me say a one more time if you don't have a sense of humor about yourself

[01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:54.030]
You're gonna live a very very sad and depressive. I'm gonna be taking a lot of value

[01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:57.710]
And a lot of our pros act with the raw what's his name? Ron Raymond whatever's they mean

[01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:02.510]
Here's it not today Ron. It'll be about give you the signal in about three years

[01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:04.890]
Here's a mobile and lake worth hello

[01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:06.390]
Hey Neil. Yes, sir

[01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:12.350]
Well, I gotta say I'm a little politician. Yes, and I don't think you should be engaged

[01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:18.230]
Yeah, because I'll say what I think for our party

[01:09:18.790 --> 01:09:23.370]
He has been the greatest thing that ever happened in a republican party. We'll probably gonna pick up 40

[01:09:24.610 --> 01:09:29.550]
How it's probably gonna pick up six seven cent at sea. Uh-huh. I don't know. Do you know that?

[01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:34.470]
I know the truth you think that the you don't think there's gonna be a backlash by people that are pissed off at the Ken

[01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:38.650]
Star if that's the case if the if the people really are gonna take it out of the Democratic party

[01:09:38.650 --> 01:09:42.670]
And the people who pissed off how come as approval ratings are going up. I'm not saying they're not

[01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:47.990]
I hope you know, I'm going out of the space. Yeah, you have practiced the story to Democratic party

[01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:51.390]
We got us the Congress tonight and born. Yeah

[01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:55.970]
We're increasing the Senate's team. Yeah, and increased governorships. Mm-hmm

[01:09:55.970 --> 01:10:03.410]
And uh, you know, I think it's great. I just wonder if I leave him alone. No, the sun is what you're saying is that your party is more important than the country is that what you're saying

[01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:06.910]
Well, no, I'm saying that's good as long as you know everybody

[01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:12.830]
No, I don't really know if those are all in people's attention, but it's it's significantly wink in him

[01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:18.490]
As to be a woman you're really answering the question about it now. He's approval rating

[01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:22.430]
What's he's done a pretty good job? I'm not saying he hasn't yeah

[01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:28.990]
What I'm saying that for the Republican party for the best thing to wrap. Okay. Well, you know a lot of people have said that

[01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:33.250]
The public is very happy with the Democratic president of the Republican Congress. Maybe that's the way it is

[01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:37.190]
Maybe but I wouldn't count your votes before they come in because I think you may be surprised

[01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:41.990]
There you go. Okay. I got you down 1127 at 560

[01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:46.670]
Where you got it. It's forced radio 560 QA

[01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:49.890]
I'm sure and got on those with who or what?

[01:10:50.490 --> 01:10:54.870]
Yeah, but my point is he's got a wrong stash of stonies. All right

[01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:59.130]
Hey, well, I'm going to see he's doing right by the you know by the country and let him do his deal

[01:10:59.130 --> 01:10:59.430]
I mean

[01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:01.750]
just because he's he's

[01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:05.270]
Father of the United States as you will

[01:11:06.370 --> 01:11:08.570]
It's more serious. He's wide about it

[01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:10.730]
But I know that all your listeners are out there

[01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:17.370]
They've done the same thing that he's done. I'm sure but I mean why is he any different? You know if he lied he lied

[01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:19.650]
Yeah, I don't agree with him lying about it

[01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:24.790]
But he got caught but I can tell you there's how many other people have been in that office that haven't done the same thing

[01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:30.250]
Just first of all one of these people aren't understand because the media is not doing a very good job of laying the

[01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:34.530]
Zop for them when two people have a consenting affair and it could be a source of

[01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:40.170]
Endurism for one or both of them and usually that's the case they have there's an understanding there and they they you know

[01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:44.370]
They make sure that they talk about ways to cover their ass and to be sure that it doesn't leak out

[01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:50.210]
So he from the beginning had every reason to assume because she kept assuring him that she wasn't gonna spill the beans

[01:11:50.210 --> 01:11:56.990]
She wasn't gonna open up her big fat mouth for her foot and so he had every reasonably that they were both going to be lying about it

[01:11:56.990 --> 01:12:02.450]
Because they were both agreeing to cover up and after a marital affair in his case right and her case being a slut

[01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:05.130]
I mean why is it this a particular woman

[01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:10.050]
Has brought up the distance whenever Paula Jones couldn't get locked on with it

[01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:14.490]
I mean they turned her right away but Paula didn't have the dress

[01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:19.150]
Have a great day pal. All right good luck. That's right. No, no, seriously

[01:12:19.150 --> 01:12:21.030]
If she didn't have the stained dress

[01:12:21.650 --> 01:12:24.070]
That would have been the end of it there would have been no more nothing

[01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:27.990]
And would strictly be one of those he said she said her reward and her word

[01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:31.490]
She's already a confessed liar and which again they keep forgetting about

[01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:35.970]
She lied through her teeth and her testimony to Paula Jones civil trial lie all over the place

[01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:40.490]
She didn't have a fair. She didn't have an affair. She thinks about she had a cigar

[01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:43.870]
She's lying all over the guy that place in fact she told her friend

[01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:48.470]
That was one of the things we heard months ago is that all the experience. She's had being a liar all her life

[01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:50.810]
She's an expert at it

[01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:55.530]
Just like Kathleen Willie's girlfriend said although she asked her to lie for like two or three different times

[01:12:56.010 --> 01:13:00.350]
The same Kathleen Willie that kept writing those letters after this incident allegedly happened

[01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:05.130]
About how what a big fan she was and hoping to come back and work in a presence reelection campaign

[01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:12.890]
See if you're gonna dimble around don't start screaming like three four years later or a couple of years later

[01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:17.470]
Oh, well, gee. He did this he did if you're gonna screw around and you want to make a complaint about it do it now

[01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:24.050]
Not later on like an afterthought whether it's a Republican whether it's a Democrat whether it's an e-dehilt or Paula Jones or anybody else

[01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:26.890]
I

[01:13:26.890 --> 01:13:31.790]
Here's a mobile in my movie chill out. Yeah, hello Neil. Yes, sir. Hi. How are you great?

[01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:36.630]
Good glad to hear it. I just wanted to talk to a little about your thing that's going on with the president

[01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:38.970]
How about personal feeling on it as follows?

[01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:44.690]
You know the guy had an extra marital affair. Let's think it 80% of the men in this country are having extra marital affairs

[01:13:44.690 --> 01:13:46.610]
I think that he should be impeached because

[01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:52.750]
Listen the guy is representing the United States from there the entire international community

[01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:58.350]
And it's coming across being taken as a sexual tape. Okay, keep your penis in a pan. Uh-huh

[01:13:58.910 --> 01:14:02.970]
And of course we know that doesn't happen anywhere else in the world happens all over the world

[01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:11.190]
This is the person who is directing things around the world how many countries in the world can say that they do and are responsible for

[01:14:11.690 --> 01:14:18.150]
What the United States is? Let me ask you this did Rose develop was he the president four times through the impression and then the world for?

[01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:23.530]
Yes, okay, I have a great thing was he?

[01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:31.250]
No, I just made it up. I just made it up

[01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.910]
Oh

[01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:44.070]
Okay, we have an open-line of David's this move along and then you know the American public

[01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:49.070]
The education system was and you know if you weren't living through which how was three years old when Roosevelt died?

[01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:53.290]
Okay, but I've done a little reading in my life. Everybody knows he had a mistress. She was there when he died

[01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:56.950]
Eleanor became a bulldog for whatever she decided

[01:14:56.950 --> 01:15:01.270]
You know, she was going off this way in her own way and she had a wife didn't even live in the same house

[01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:05.010]
He had a built a separate bought a separate house for her or she was living with her

[01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:09.310]
With her whatever she was friend her buddy bud

[01:15:11.210 --> 01:15:11.570]
And

[01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:15.070]
He somehow got us to you know and and was respected all over the world

[01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:19.950]
There he was at the multi conference and the yalta conference and by the time he died by the way he was like

[01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:23.570]
Seen hall is all hell, but that's beside the point he had a lot of stress

[01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:29.750]
Is if this guy is suggesting I better put him down for we're getting him on this number five

[01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:34.890]
Suggesting that because the guy's screwing around that he has no respect around the rest of the world quite in the contrary

[01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:40.130]
Lemon in Paris where they know about screw it around the headline yesterday was sexual

[01:15:41.490 --> 01:15:42.670]
McCarthyism in America

[01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:44.650]
Which hunts

[01:15:46.050 --> 01:15:50.310]
The only ones that were up fighting Prudish about it of course with the brits all the British papers yesterday

[01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:56.190]
Ah, hi. He's out. He's got to go because the brits they all like to do it, but they pretend they don't like the royal family

[01:15:56.830 --> 01:16:02.110]
Who do it a lot with anything that moves? We have an opalion in date five six seven oh five sixty

[01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:07.730]
Five sixty on the eighteen T wireless line and if you've seen the royal family you understand why those do with anything that moves

[01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:11.590]
Because they all are rich that wins your family baby. Are they beautiful or what?

[01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:14.990]
Here's a western hello

[01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:20.470]
Hello, yes, sir. I do I want to be arena and it's unbelievable

[01:16:21.230 --> 01:16:26.670]
It's we almost gave up our tickets because it was it's is they're very expensive to see right?

[01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:29.470]
I'm in 134 that were you are 134 on the one oh

[01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:32.150]
You're one over from me and

[01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:37.250]
We had a lot of mid-mints this coming year and so I was gonna miss a lot of games

[01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:42.550]
But we I went to the arena on Friday just to take a look at it Friday? Yeah

[01:16:43.150 --> 01:16:47.790]
You know I snuck in the back with the construction workers. Yeah, well you just it's a thing is huge

[01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:52.010]
You mean you can get lost if you go downstairs in the ground floor where the locker rooms are right

[01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:54.170]
It's I've told me that thing is not gigantic

[01:16:54.930 --> 01:16:59.470]
It's big and I went when I sat in my seat and

[01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:03.470]
I mean we're in a fifth row down the front and and I just said

[01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:08.170]
You know you lose the spot you lose the spot you can't make it up next year and say okay

[01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:11.170]
I just came my mind once they're gone they're gone and so

[01:17:11.170 --> 01:17:14.010]
We just found some people that want to come in with us on them

[01:17:14.010 --> 01:17:17.390]
But I there it was night and the people there were nice

[01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:23.390]
It's I'll tell you the people that are in the mean a club section the restaurant and that whole thing up there on that

[01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:27.590]
That level there where we are sweet talk. It's first class

[01:17:28.050 --> 01:17:28.450]
Whatever

[01:17:29.150 --> 01:17:30.730]
High thing those problems are

[01:17:31.450 --> 01:17:36.050]
You did get this thing done or at least as people did the one thing and I was they got this thing done a one year

[01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:40.930]
They did a super job. There's no question about that. It's palatial. It's just it's unbelievable the

[01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:41.950]
although

[01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:47.610]
The access to the players this year. I mean there's a fence then just like in the football stadium

[01:17:47.610 --> 01:17:51.530]
There's gonna be a little fence in area with a guard gate there around the back

[01:17:51.970 --> 01:17:52.370]
So

[01:17:52.810 --> 01:17:57.290]
You know those days where you could hang out with the players and leave them alone

[01:17:57.850 --> 01:18:00.410]
But believe me after the game after most of the games this year

[01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:04.330]
I have a feeling they're gonna want to get out of there and hurry anyway, but it's it's gonna be now

[01:18:04.330 --> 01:18:10.430]
I mean a road and it's just it's an incredible walking in that place. Yep. It's really special. Well, thank god

[01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:13.750]
We got a great arena. It is really nice. This is staying with with

[01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:19.630]
The president. I met girls like this and I know guys that have met girls like this up when they were in college

[01:18:19.630 --> 01:18:23.690]
The spandee live in his fantasy land. So you grow. He loves me

[01:18:23.690 --> 01:18:26.430]
There's wife and I mean the story

[01:18:27.150 --> 01:18:27.410]
She

[01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:33.010]
What a sleeve bag this girl is what I'm mad about is the people that were around the president

[01:18:33.010 --> 01:18:39.850]
Why didn't they when they see her there? Why they didn't kick her ass out of unless you would blight now

[01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:41.890]
They eventually did but I mean not soon enough

[01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:46.890]
But I mean they realized that it was becoming that she was psychobic and that it was becoming out of control

[01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:53.270]
They finally got a rash ripped off to the Pentagon, but in the meantime he was in a talking to a dittle on the phone and

[01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:58.650]
Making arrangements for her sneak in other ways and that's where it goes. I had

[01:18:59.210 --> 01:19:02.270]
suspected that maybe she was blackmailing him and

[01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:06.930]
You know if he didn't cooperate she was gonna tell all and they said that last night

[01:19:06.930 --> 01:19:12.690]
They were talking about that she's right when we fight you know got rid of her and sent her off and go some other department

[01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:20.370]
That she said that if you don't cooperate, I'm gonna tell all and this is what happens when you get stuck with these

[01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:24.890]
And then then he got a job of the you went in the beginning she thought that was fine and then she thought about wow

[01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:29.870]
I rather have a job in the private sector and you know, I mean she showed her two colors in the end

[01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:34.350]
And that's why she kept the dress because she's a she's a scorned bitch. Yeah, that's exactly what it is

[01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:35.870]
Okay, pal. Thanks. See you at the arena

[01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:39.030]
Okay, there's somebody that saw the arena although not on Saturday

[01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:42.110]
If we anybody else out there that was in to see their seats of the arena on Saturday

[01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:45.410]
No, there was sure a lot of traffic out there in West Broward. Oh nobody out there

[01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:48.510]
It's 1155 and oh

[01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:50.410]
Barnes and the expose wow

[01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:53.510]
I mentioned I have at least 15 frogs for that game there tonight

[01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:58.870]
Boy you talk about a franchise and big trouble Montreal expose the team sucks the fans suck

[01:19:59.310 --> 01:20:01.290]
The city sucks more y'all

[01:20:02.410 --> 01:20:03.970]
Hey, everybody out there knows that I love

[01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:05.670]
Q a l

[01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:08.470]
The Neil Roger show holy

[01:20:09.090 --> 01:20:14.710]
Maconon this is Joe Bolin the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority Q a.m

[01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:19.270]
So Michael Russo wrote a real skating column was it yesterday or the 84 about the

[01:20:19.810 --> 01:20:25.490]
It's gonna be another crap team which I thought Michael Russo and now evidently they got to them and said hey, you better cut the crap

[01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:30.110]
And today's paper panthers reversal of fortune began with trade from a claim

[01:20:30.570 --> 01:20:35.510]
Oh my god here on the one hand they're trying to tell us that they're desperate to trade him and they were a praying out of the

[01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:39.630]
Got Sean Burke who was very weak anyway that now would be a good idea to get rid of Kirkman claim

[01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:40.950]
There's two and a half million dollar salary

[01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:46.090]
But just in case they can't get rid of him in case they can't sign cable weeks and case they have to keep Kirk the jerk

[01:20:46.670 --> 01:20:51.350]
Now they're trying to pedal the story about hey, you know things really started to turn around for us after we got him

[01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:55.630]
A couple of games that he played a couple of good games as usual stuck to join out

[01:20:56.770 --> 01:21:01.510]
Oh my god the spin doctors are ready to gamble one good piece of news for the few hockey fans

[01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:06.010]
I got out there in this audience is this year nobody's gonna be interfering with the stuff that I got to say

[01:21:06.010 --> 01:21:11.270]
I don't care what anybody thinks whether they like it. They don't like it bad good or indifferent. I'm gonna say exactly

[01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:14.730]
The way it is and if they don't like it too bad

[01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:20.590]
We have an open line at Dave wanted Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line

[01:21:21.130 --> 01:21:22.290]
Here's Miami hello

[01:21:23.010 --> 01:21:25.150]
Hello, yes sir Neil your god. Yes, I am

[01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:29.490]
Um, first of all, Republicans are using this independent council as a weapon

[01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:36.150]
Uh, you know, they spent 40 million dollars to find out that Clinton had a had a fixed life and uh

[01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:41.930]
Now this is this is a larger issue. The Republican got nothing better to do than

[01:21:42.450 --> 01:21:44.510]
And the disgrace this guy is already in office

[01:21:45.170 --> 01:21:48.850]
And this is the outrage I think and what really cracks me up his last night

[01:21:48.850 --> 01:21:50.850]
You know some of these pundits these uh

[01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:54.750]
These sanctum only as hypocrites in the media sitting around saying well, you know

[01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:58.890]
Are we ever gonna be able to look at him again and view him in the same way that we did before

[01:21:58.890 --> 01:22:02.850]
You know how many people that we look at every day who are screwing around with everything that moves

[01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:05.990]
What does that have to do with the price of rice? What does that have to do with anything?

[01:22:06.610 --> 01:22:11.790]
Well, if it's not Clinton they're gonna go after them. They're gonna go after core. Yeah, and they're already doing that

[01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:15.930]
And when will the Republican stop using the reusing the independent council as a weapon?

[01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:23.130]
You know, they're changing the face of politics in a worse way. Yeah, and uh, the American public deserves this because they've been going through it until life

[01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:25.930]
And not involved in politics. Well, the Dow is up

[01:22:25.930 --> 01:22:31.070]
2011 points. So somebody out there must be relieved that this is only God and we're all sticking our heads in the standard

[01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:33.330]
There's a third rate sex story. Okay. Have a great day sir

[01:22:33.330 --> 01:22:35.570]
We have an open line in uh

[01:22:36.710 --> 01:22:39.650]
Broward 56705 60 pound five 60 on a mobile one line

[01:22:40.570 --> 01:22:42.370]
There's a mobile in West Palm Beach. Hello

[01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:44.410]
Neil how are you today? Okay, sir

[01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:52.070]
I two things earlier you said that the royals were doing anything that move was that with a beer and oh oh at

[01:22:52.730 --> 01:22:54.930]
M oh oh after M.O.V.D.S

[01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:57.670]
Anything that moves or moves moves

[01:22:57.670 --> 01:23:05.310]
Oh, right um other thing it cracked me up. I hadn't be have a radio access. There are some princess Margaret. I think she moves

[01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:10.010]
She has before that got caught in jack coal the other afternoon

[01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:11.730]
And I heard a guy call in

[01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:18.110]
Is unfeeling and it's of course made the stiffnesses on his foot. He said

[01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:25.970]
Can you imagine the president standing across from a terrorist and that the terrorist has to have an answer of yes or no

[01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:30.410]
From the president will he believe what the president says to him? Yeah, that's not

[01:23:30.410 --> 01:23:35.850]
We only work into the president stands and what's out of doing the terrorist stands under their naces other down

[01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:40.270]
It's too good. Yeah, it's probably people out there that don't have them

[01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:44.610]
I'm so thankful the Clinton got one so they can enjoy it. Okay. Take care, Neil

[01:23:44.610 --> 01:23:45.150]
See yeah

[01:23:45.150 --> 01:23:50.150]
That's right for a lot of people out there who are desperate see those are the people are read those romance novels and

[01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:55.290]
All those other salacious lady chatterlies lover. They're running into the library. You know to get it when it first came out

[01:23:55.290 --> 01:23:58.410]
Oh, gee, I got to read I got to read about it because I can't get it

[01:23:58.410 --> 01:24:03.210]
I can't do any myself so I better read about it like all those losers on the internet

[01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:10.990]
Oh, that is so sad. We have an open line in date county five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line

[01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:15.490]
There's a mobile in port pierce hello. Hey Neil. How you doing? Okay, sir

[01:24:15.490 --> 01:24:22.470]
Um first of all as now president can be in a piece for anything involving questionable morality

[01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:23.510]
Okay

[01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:26.770]
Secondly says who where did that come from?

[01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:30.390]
It's I learned it in political science. It's not true

[01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:35.770]
Whoever told you learned it in political science. So it makes it so so because somebody questionable morality

[01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:41.410]
He's got him to do it. We've had play rover Cleveland a father to trial out a wedlock and he was reelected president

[01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:45.530]
Of Thomas Jefferson was having sex with his slave. He was reelected president

[01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:51.450]
I'm just letting you know I read that in the book sir. It is not true high crimes in this demeanors

[01:24:51.450 --> 01:24:53.250]
Which is not which is not defined?

[01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.870]
Okay, also

[01:24:55.630 --> 01:24:59.250]
If anything else, they should be impeached for security because

[01:24:59.910 --> 01:25:06.990]
All right, like when I was in the military, right? I had a top secret clearance and we had to attend classes

[01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:08.270]
To show

[01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:14.690]
To show us like on our personal time how we could get picked up by somebody or whatever and then

[01:25:14.690 --> 01:25:20.270]
You know, it could be a spy from another country or whatever and they could get bet by talk out of us or whatever. Yeah

[01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:23.730]
Okay, like the entities were doing. Yes, right. So I mean

[01:25:24.450 --> 01:25:24.890]
He

[01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:30.390]
You know, he should have used more discretion as far as that goes and part as far as for wait

[01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:35.930]
I don't you think that when Monica Lewinsky came in was brought in as an intern that there was some screening and they found out that she wasn't

[01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:37.290]
some kind of a spy for

[01:25:37.290 --> 01:25:40.890]
For the communist is or for the sand and east is or any other

[01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:49.490]
The only one. I mean how many are in line saying it now hundred? You know and secondly, I feel there. I'm enlisting

[01:25:49.490 --> 01:25:50.570]
I thirdly

[01:25:50.570 --> 01:25:50.810]
um

[01:25:51.930 --> 01:25:58.370]
As far as everybody else doing is that doesn't make a difference. Okay, um when you get a speeding ticket and you go to court

[01:25:58.370 --> 01:26:03.050]
You say well everybody was doing that. They don't care about that. Okay. Everybody else doing it isn't a defense

[01:26:03.610 --> 01:26:07.890]
All right, so now would you comparing impeaching the president of the United States with getting a speeding ticket?

[01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:13.070]
Is that what you're saying? Is that how serious this matter is? No, I'm just saying that everybody else does it isn't

[01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:17.790]
Isn't it excuse? It's not right. Okay, cheating is not right. I mean

[01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:21.670]
So let me just say this to you. Okay. No, this may come as a revolutionary concept

[01:26:21.670 --> 01:26:26.670]
Did it ever dawn on you that if nobody's business? I've heard many people make that comment last week

[01:26:26.670 --> 01:26:30.850]
And I and I've also said that before that when they asked them these questions back in January

[01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:33.090]
He should have said it's nobody's god damn business

[01:26:33.090 --> 01:26:35.570]
The people are real happy with the job I'm doing this president

[01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:40.490]
And let's move on with the affairs of government and I'll worry about my affairs and my marriage and don't be worrying about it

[01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:41.530]
It's nobody's business

[01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:46.610]
He was being super sexual harassment that's directly relative to the case in a case that was thrown

[01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:48.930]
I know it was not the right. Let me say it again, sir

[01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:54.510]
The judge in that case, you know you didn't you just got through tell me that you took what kind of a course and intercourse

[01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:58.430]
Political science where you must have flunked pal because you know what you're talking about

[01:26:59.770 --> 01:27:05.090]
That evidence was that that testimony rather in a his deposition was ruled immaterial by the judge

[01:27:06.130 --> 01:27:09.410]
It wasn't relevant and then the case was thrown out

[01:27:11.150 --> 01:27:16.670]
But this guy learned oh yeah, you can be impeached for immorality based on what he read it in the book somewhere

[01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:18.610]
He just is making it up as he goes along

[01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:26.390]
And if you want to read more in fact they had Alexander Hamilton wrote in a more lengthy treatise

[01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:31.750]
In 1789 about impeachment and what it was meant to be used for and not a political football

[01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:38.830]
And he expounded and expanded on it and believe me this kind of thing had nothing to do with what the founding fathers had in mind

[01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:42.510]
What they had in mind is that I might want to you know

[01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:46.850]
Abandon elections take over the government etc and so on those are the kinds of things

[01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:48.450]
That's what high crimes in misdemeanors

[01:27:48.450 --> 01:27:53.730]
Well, it was referenced through by the founding fathers. I mean like Nixon would say not because somebody is screwing around

[01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:57.290]
And anybody who would compare this is never with you water

[01:27:57.290 --> 01:28:00.610]
And the abuse of every agency of government

[01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:06.990]
Over the line I got news for every president who's ever been in here has lied

[01:28:07.770 --> 01:28:13.910]
Do I know that for a fact? No, that's just my best educated guest and certainly in my life fun each and every one of them is lies

[01:28:15.370 --> 01:28:18.870]
And this are all inspected by the way this sanctum on the assassin from Pennsylvania

[01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:25.650]
He's still looking for the magic bullet on that stretcher at Parkland hospital in Dallas that single magic bullet that killed Kennedy and went you

[01:28:26.210 --> 01:28:29.350]
Connolly's wrist and went hearing that and right up into his recto right

[01:28:30.610 --> 01:28:34.210]
Somebody needs to get him some psychological help and also fix those jowls

[01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:36.950]
It's 11 after noon at 5.62

[01:28:46.650 --> 01:28:47.090]
Okay

[01:28:51.150 --> 01:28:56.490]
The city council on foreign relations it's hot enough for like two seconds just so they realize that he's still lying there

[01:28:57.350 --> 01:29:02.330]
First thing they needed was for America to put its economic house in order. Okay, that's not well

[01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:04.470]
Just so they realize he's still you know doing this thing

[01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:11.850]
He hasn't like sculpt off in a corner ahead and somewhere with his skull cap on he's just still doing a business in the moving right along

[01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:16.910]
So far we got what's the 17 and 17 say ought to stay in one

[01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:23.530]
To six 17 six a day out of his time to be in peace. That's like 70 to 30 percent. That's an interesting number isn't it?

[01:29:25.630 --> 01:29:30.110]
Kind of like mirroring those numbers that we see in virtually every other pole by every other network except ABC

[01:29:30.110 --> 01:29:34.950]
Where Sam Donaldson and George Willough putting all the extra vote and Kookie Roberts is putting the icing on a case

[01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:42.870]
ABC news no credibility zero whatsoever. Okay, a TV news lynch mob. That's what ABC is

[01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:49.630]
And also MSNBC. I guess NBC figures will be got the NBC network, which is very liberal

[01:29:49.630 --> 01:29:53.410]
So let's take one branch of that MSNBC and put all the fascist on over there

[01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:57.790]
Like that John Gibson. I'm gonna tell you something if I ever saw him out there in the street

[01:29:57.790 --> 01:30:04.150]
I would take a nail with two by four with a rusty nail and just a bit slap that's come back. He makes me nauseous

[01:30:04.150 --> 01:30:11.050]
When Clinton was doing the his speech about when the Friday night they were doing the thing with the Irish group out there at the White House in a Hillary and the Ted Kennedy

[01:30:11.630 --> 01:30:12.330]
and George Mitchell

[01:30:12.970 --> 01:30:17.010]
And they have clips of that on there then he finally finished speaking and John Gibson comes back

[01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:21.650]
I swear to you. I thought he was gonna have an accident in his pants. He was like, oh the president is finished

[01:30:23.370 --> 01:30:25.430]
speaking and we'll be right back. Oh, yeah, seriously

[01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:30.530]
I think you had such sexual excitement that I thought maybe he was hiding a cigar somewhere like maybe in his record. Wow

[01:30:32.050 --> 01:30:37.770]
Who the hell are you kidding John Gibson you phony baloney go back and cover the old J-crow less more your speed you jackass

[01:30:37.770 --> 01:30:42.910]
I mean anybody honors and pedal to have whatever opinion they want

[01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:48.590]
But if you're pretending to be a moderator and to be like, you know impartial and all along

[01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:53.730]
Everybody realizes that you're not who the hell are you kidding kidding anybody except a few of those old ladies out there watching

[01:30:55.530 --> 01:30:56.070]
Here's a

[01:30:56.770 --> 01:30:58.830]
Where we going mobile in the song rest hello

[01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:01.730]
Oh, yes sir

[01:31:03.150 --> 01:31:04.210]
Hello, yes sir

[01:31:05.890 --> 01:31:09.750]
Speak to me sir. Oh, okay. Yeah, I wouldn't take that my state Saturday and

[01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:14.430]
It's nice. The only thing is about the parking lot they finished the

[01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:14.550]
uh

[01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:18.590]
Oh, couldn't far finish the big road which went the street down in the bridge

[01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:21.410]
Mm-hmm. Then it's the road so we can get in and out. Yeah

[01:31:22.130 --> 01:31:25.390]
I'm the only thing I think I don't know how long is that gonna be I don't know

[01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:31.030]
But that's that they've been working on that curve at open and flamingo forever. Mm-hmm. And it's still not even done. It'll be done

[01:31:31.630 --> 01:31:32.450]
I'll be home

[01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:38.270]
In fact, the arena was really nice. The last time I was in the arena before last week was the back in

[01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:44.350]
June which is only like two and a half months ago. Right. So maybe with you gonna early July and the amount of work

[01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:47.750]
That they got done in two months was those spectacular that uh, yeah

[01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:52.730]
Well, once they get all the basics in there in the foundakins what they can do with just a couple of months will amazing

[01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:57.310]
Oh, I don't guess that he's really nice, but it's gonna be so much better than the real okay

[01:31:57.910 --> 01:32:00.670]
I'll see you there. Thank you. I'll see you there. We'll have a great time

[01:32:00.670 --> 01:32:02.350]
It's quite of the fact we're gonna have a bogus team

[01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:05.110]
We're gonna have lots of excuses and they're doing the spins all again

[01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:11.270]
They're spinning it all over the place you spin this okay Brian see one thing I want to remind you Brian wasn't a genius last year

[01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:13.690]
Is he gonna be a genius this year? No, he's still the same guy

[01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:17.030]
And yeah, they try they try to get the

[01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:19.850]
Resurring they wanted goes if they couldn't get him at least be in the
