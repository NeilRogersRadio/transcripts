[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]
First thing this morning our who to calls which cut you all the bull crap you're right to do your chase

[00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.880]
And that is done pretty given little guy credit all week last week. I kept hearing oh gee

[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.720]
He's you know he's a flash in a pan and he's okay against week opponent and he's okay in the shore

[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.460]
I he a played great yesterday nice gone Dougie and

[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.200]
number two

[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.000]
Dumbest coaching call well in fact this weekend there were two of the dumbest coaching calls and

[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.060]
comments in the history of the human race

[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.540]
In this business about why you know taking a risk they got the game first of all Buffalo

[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.860]
Mrs. The field goal Christie who's eradicate best

[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.300]
Mrs. The field goal early in the game then that offense gets the ball go down for touchdown

[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.900]
They got all the momentum going on airside that all season long third and one through the first and goal on the two yard line

[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.200]
If they're gonna get a touchdown Danny has to throw the ball because they can't run in the clutch. They can't run an inch

[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.500]
So they got fourth and an inch on their own 36 yard line and I'm saying to myself at this point

[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.420]
When Jimmy Johnson with his white hair says all golf or it's all you name

[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.740]
That's what I always say go forward. It's all in it. They say no. We'll pass. Thank you

[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.560]
And I'm saying my boy if they should wind up losing a close game very early in the game because he's a hard-ass and

[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.940]
What can I tell you and he don't like the medium does like anybody that would your criticizing so he can't say that and

[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.540]
Then lost the game foodie played great. That's that's it and then of course the panthers come out there on

[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.280]
What night was it Friday and say that one great game of the season they played so far against the black ops who are pretty mediocre anyway

[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.460]
But nevertheless here you go great again Mike Mark perish four goals

[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.500]
It's you a

[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.660]
Florida spot not good. It's great

[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.080]
Such assholes they are but guess what he's gonna ask. Oh, there you go

[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.420]
So at any way one of the interesting things that came by that then I psyched profusely the guy that brought it

[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.120]
Because I never thought I would see a copy of this was

[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.140]
Okay, play it slower and also inside the box of the video

[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.400]
Hollywood classic collection so if there's anybody out there that would like to know what but they also have re-promiveness

[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.420]
And if anybody wants to own copy this is

[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.200]
1936 by the way with you that movie came out and if you want your own copy of it to find out where you're you know

[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.740]
Where all this is scary about marijuana came from in his country. This was the movie that started it

[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.840]
It is the campiest most hysterical. He's a crap

[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.080]
Here's the telephone number you can call it's 818 9 9 1

[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.200]
But profusely the guys who brought that by I a fantastic column which I'm gonna read. Oh, is he gonna read again today?

[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.040]
I guess he is. That's the it is pretty long

[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.680]
From city length October do you think we really have somebody in town whose real name is Howard Wheeler

[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.440]
Or what because you know me I hit those pony names like the erudges. I can't stand it

[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.440]
It says very dillars experiment in Miami is flashing like a classic TV wreck it's crashing baby

[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.620]
Says when used properly in plan well television is the single most gripping former communication known to man

[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.280]
It is taking us live to other planets a lot of us to watch leaders of countries go down in flames

[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.120]
Let this entertain and sometimes gasping for breath of the scope of human drama and competition

[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.540]
However when used improperly and left to the devices of those better suited for something as intricate as taxi taxi

[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.260]
Dermy television as the innate ability become nothing more than a wash our accent on I 95

[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.360]
Everyone stops to look at the carnage then shakes their head and disbelief

[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.060]
You've seen these TV rec survived the pony the waiting of the mucosa

[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.700]
Acid use the magic tower on top was smoke about the basketball superstar would be able to

[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.560]
Spring two months. They'll are honest a lot of the words together

[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.200]
Along with Paulie Shore of Gary Colton you get the idea

[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.720]
After the start cross graveyard the local programming concept known as city vision now playing locally on Wami channel 69

[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.400]
Brought to you by media mogul and home shopping that were founder Barry Diller

[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.620]
He's an asshole after a few months of doing this bold and expensive effort

[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.100]
One could surmise that now since NBC's super train is there been such a loud costly and visible train wreck on the tube

[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.560]
If this station were sold on bill or shopping network would be paired with Gimpsu knives and chia pipes

[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.940]
Trouble is the station would cut the value of both

[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.980]
Not in CBS first block WCIX and hired a sportscaster from Cleveland

[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:30.180]
You used to end the shows by ringing the large-earned cast belt against the week award as they've been such an embarrassment and softloaded television

[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.840]
Certainly never in the history of television in general and so badly

[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.980]
The concept was greeted with skepticism by just about everyone in the industry including the almighty advertising sector

[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.060]
An entire station filled with nothing but locally produced programming the plan was to launch in Miami becoming huge success

[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:54.240]
Then import the concept to deal as other stations in places like New York and Chicago at the rate when he has progressed the home shopping network is looking better all the time

[00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.820]
Even before when he made its debut a mistakes were made from which the station has yet to be covered the marketing scheme was identified as Miami

[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.880]
It take off on the call letters this the theory went would show the stations post knit ties for the area and be easy for all to remember

[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.340]
Which see it as the city as a blight on the landscape

[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.160]
Also a lot of consumer dollars come from Broward in other words right from the very first second of every time

[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.500]
Man when he managed to all alienate a huge force the potential viewers strike one

[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.140]
At falling to the ground like those autumn leaves don't get too excited about a couple of games

[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.960]
But decisions in this town over the weekend. Oh my just enough to me just a piss off the Pope

[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.780]
Open line in day five and you mark my words there'll be people there'll be assholes in this town who got their headway up

[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.280]
Jimmy's ass who will be defending that decision. Oh, what's wrong with the coach?

[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.940]
You know being a gutsy

[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.140]
Gutsy is one thing stupid is another thing

[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:54.680]
What's the upside of making a first down on first and fourth and an inch on your own 36 yard line when you got to lead

[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.000]
You got all the momentum going or he wanted to take the crowd out of the game

[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.440]
Yeah, any of the Pope with one of his final stupid meaningless articles and held this one starts out like he's gonna criticize

[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.260]
Jimmy for that. In fact, he says one

[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.280]
I was one of his

[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.320]
He says

[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.900]
It's

[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.840]
Jimmy go for it on fourth and one brainstorm was his worst constant

[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.260]
He took over the dolphin to his a gamble with almost no upside and the downside the course that could have cost it

[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.980]
And he goes and finally the art series like backtracking and well Jimmy wanted to take the crowd out of the game

[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.400]
Yeah, right Eddie right you little suck. Oh, you see now old fart

[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.600]
Like I said, I'm at the most of them I get excited because we'll never ever have a real sports writer in this town

[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.400]
We'll never have anybody who really knows how to write an article in which he says something and doesn't

[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.080]
Equivicate and dance all over the place

[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.860]
It was really intimidated and afraid to come out and say it like it is

[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:52.800]
Did he like bagging they used to be called the excess or whatever what what

[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.080]
What language are you speaking sir?

[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:06.580]
He's not he's not speaking any language. Okay, just another moron. Okay, they lies are all open five states of difference whether it's based in brown or based in date or based in on

[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.140]
Roar based in you ask based in Uranus

[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.100]
That's the commentary we get there. We the article which is right on target by the way

[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.800]
On everything they said including how dull and boring the present taste of this show has been because there's been no investment

[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.640]
I know no commitment to doing anything to what to give anybody reason to watch it quite frankly

[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.700]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello

[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.200]
Hi, Neil. Yes sir. Hi, why is my first time following yes?

[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.000]
You're talking about the

[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.620]
NFL I have a good slogan before the NFL and that's no sound leak. Yeah

[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.960]
What do you think? I think you ought to have an ice day. We have an open line in power to and date five six seven oh five fifty

[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.080]

We're ready for them today. Are they ready for us? 10 55 and taking hello

[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.300]
Yeah, let me ask you a question every time I

[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.860]
Roger that in my quantum scan to the radio I'm always hearing

[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:08.280]
Reggae music and the patient station. Yeah. What are they? What are they doing about this because I'm getting sick and tired?

[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.980]
Well, then don't just scan the stations anymore. That would solve your problem

[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.660]
We have two open lines that grow and wanted to do wireless line. Here's a mobile in Oakland's part. Hello

I got two things number one. I thought your bonuses were a lot more than

[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:33.760]
$200. So you are? Okay, but the bonuses. So that's the employee of the month bonus. Oh, I see

[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.340]
Yeah, okay. That's the let's kiss your ass bonus and try to make up for the fact that we have your pissed off all the rest of the time bonus

[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.880]
That's what that is. $200 then I say. Uh-huh. Or if you take the pen then you might get the awarding

[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.780]
So I'm assuming the Hank always takes the pen. I'd like to congratulate the asshole and the dumb trucks

[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.820]
There was like three of them the blue or red light when a baby's in the car. Yeah, I'm not a good thing

[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:59.060]
Okay, there you go. Just a little work on that. We'll have one. We have open line and Dave and all of our boy

[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.960]
You're slow today. I was just a ball game folks not the end of the world just because you can't stand the truth

[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.320]
5.6705 sign

[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.440]

[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.440]
There's another asshole that's just fed it evidently time on the chat room on Neil Godduck

[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.500]
One by the way speaking of that I'm glad he did remind me inadvertently

Here's Miami hello

[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.340]
Hello Neil. Yes sir. How you doing? Okay. Neil you know why you're always a hitting on a poor old Jimmy

[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.500]
Mean what?

[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.240]
Mean he was you know this guy you know he's won two national titles

[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.560]
So let me ask you what is he done in Miami? What does he want here? What do we want?

[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.720]
What does he want? Nothing yet. He's getting me you know. He's regrouping man

[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:17.060]
Yeah, and you like that call yesterday on fourth and an inch on your own 36-yard line. Well, you know the bold call

[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.560]
It was a bold call. Yeah

[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:27.660]
How about the word dumb? Does that ever come to mind? No, Jimmy doesn't do it. Does Jimmy ever make a mistake? Of course he does

[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:34.220]
But you know, but he's a great coach man based on what what is he done here? What are you accomplished? Well, you know he's regrouped

[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:39.780]
Man, okay. Yeah go for regroup yourself and call us later when you got something to say that might make some sense

[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:47.300]
Can't not judge Jimmy or Danny boy because they're the untouchables in this town even though everything that I said was absolutely correct

[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:53.320]
I mean you could have a hundred million people in this town watching the same event and

[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.080]
99% of them will love you it whatever way they decide they wanted to be with ahead of time regardless of what they really see

[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.740]
Don't confuse them with the facts. That's Miami

[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.360]
We have an open line. Dave wanted brown. Why was why?

[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.100]
Mobile in Miami. Hello. Hey, Uncle Neil. Yes, sir

[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.160]
Got your bike down over the weekend. What up today, Tony?

[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.360]
But the little fall of the time on the beach

[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:23.180]
On the way coming back of course down high 95 what do I see but a tear of banner falls driving down in their mobile home with their cars

[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:29.100]
If that's hit a back. Yeah, and it means that they're coming. Oh boy. That's a sad sight even that bad

[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.140]
Looney ain't enough to keep him back with hella came from Janet boy

[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.780]
I tell you what there was one stretch where I must have passed by about

[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:42.440]
In mobile homes or small bands that so all had Ontario tags on them and it was like

[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.860]
I'm curious and Terri was not frogs you the suit that's not frogs

For frogs are in Quebec go get a uh go get a dictionary. Okay, I look up frog

[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.980]
They all had Ontario tags and this guy's calling see this is what I'm talking about

[00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.400]
We got so many people in this goddamn town who know nothing about anything

[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.800]
Anything you pick the topic no matter what it is from

[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.700]
8 to z from soup to not today. No, I think about it. No

[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.860]
Frogs with Ontario license plates. Oh my god

[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:14.640]
Whoo

[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.380]
You can smell it right over your radio at heavy

[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.800]
Doaty, baby

[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:27.960]
Man, oh man, oh shevets just one after another we keep cranking them out and it's not to show it's this town

[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.360]
Believe me when I tell you it's where we are. It's this place

[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.340]
This place

[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.560]
Whoo

[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.920]
You know something I'm gonna start smoking weed I just I just decided on the year

[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:47.920]
I am

[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.980]
In fact, if they ever you know I'm gonna do if they ever give me that

[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.580]
Employee the month again if I can survive here that long and they might have to they might be worse if we get like a 15

[00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:01.480]
Share some time in man or whatever get a 10 share. I don't think right can't get anything because like I've said before

[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.440]
You work for these people long enough you deserve a guy damn gold medal. I just they have up in

[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.320]
But we got a 10 share here in midday. So what's all this BS about that? What is that all about?

[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.280]
Why don't you give it to some of the underlings

[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.200]
Some of the people who aren't making any money hands making good bucks. I'm making a good book

[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:23.380]
But we don't need a 200 bus or the guy damn stupid thing out of piece of paper to boost our ego to stroke us

[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:29.300]
How about stroking some of the little hundred dogs out there that you keep promising all kinds of promotions and more money

[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.740]
Etc. Do you ever do that? No very rarely

[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.640]
Because again it goes back to what I said before about the un

[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.100]
Acceptable workplace kind of a thing we got going here Greg

[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.340]
Because they just don't know how to treat they don't how to treat their favorite people

[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.100]
The ones that they protect up there even though they deny it they know how to treat them

[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.400]
It's called protecting them from having to do a real day's worth

[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.040]
But when it comes to all the unsung heroes in this joint work their guy damn ass off

[00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.800]
Do they ever get very rarely employed the month? Are they getting it? No are they getting what they've been promised? No

[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.500]
When's the last time you got employed the month

[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.400]
You started a joke you never got it from these people. Yes. No, I got it a taxi

[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:16.740]
You never got employed the month. It's not bad enough that he came down there and stood in the doorway the other day and gave a song

[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.260]
That it's right on the ear no less that you're gonna get all three bonuses on November

[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.240]
20th, but he didn't say what you

[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.020]
Including a bonus from like way back January February and March I be embarrassed

[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.680]
I would go into hiding I go into my office and locked it off on the inside and I go and I hibernate

[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:40.700]
And he comes down here and says it on the ear just like today came down here a couple of months ago and says to me

[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.280]
Oh, you want to make a bet? I'll bet you'll get it someday

[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.940]
He's gonna he wants to make a bet with me, but you'll get it someday some year some century

[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:54.980]
She's

[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.200]
Jesus Christ almighty

[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:04.080]
So don't pay the little people don't live up to your promises little people and then just you know ignore them just shine

[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:11.260]
That's the kind of workplace. That's the kind of environment that Greg Reid knows how to operate here on unhappy radio

[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.440]
I'm happy though

[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.380]
Because I know sure if I had the internet and more cocius today we went over there

[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.500]
Sorry good friends and emerald coast and you know something wasn't even all that crowded because the dolphin game

[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:27.020]
I just ended and it was a sitillating no matter who you were rooting for you got to admit even you saw our

[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:32.060]
Pusses out there hell of a game unbelievable right down to that last play when they're gonna clock ran out

[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.660]
So we zipped right over to emerald coast before the crowds start to come in and the food as usual sensational

[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.020]
They got every kind of chicken dish every kind of beef dish

[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.520]
Q a l one a lot of little boy it didn't take very long

[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:51.100]
I thought that that memo was like on the walls and in the halls and grab your balls. I thought it was all over the place and it was not no

[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.640]
So evidently the troops the hard-working people over there and Sheridan street in the QM headquarters

[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.700]
Have had to work under subhuman conditions for very far too long

[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.440]
Our psychotic and rightfully so is that what we're hearing?

[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:04.420]
psychotic

[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.860]
Over the announcement of the QA employee of the month for October the month of September was bad

[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.740]
enough it was a slap in the collective faces of those people over there when they gave it to two people who work on

[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.020]
Kiss on they cut the music no as pickings snot grid in

[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.340]
FM which has nothing to do with you. I

[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.360]
Don't they have their own separate

[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.260]
employee of the month they have their own separate deal I

[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.100]
Guess but I guess that was another way of giving the back of the hand

[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.820]
I want to take back something I said okay because it's you know one thing in life you have to leave your options open

[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:41.520]
And we're all during the all I mean the whole ten months we've been all the Georgia's bonus and my bonuses and

[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:47.820]
Greg Reed's wife got sick on a plane and my bonus was two weeks like the last one and who knows when this one's gonna get paid when I'm gonna come back in here again

[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:54.580]
But I keep saying what I do know it's just the way they do business, but he's really a good guy. He's not a good guy

[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.940]
Greg Reed. He's in a household. There you go

[00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:04.360]
I mean what if you're gonna have something like this which there's nothing that requires in radio business or many other business

[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:09.440]
Where you got a bunch of people working together you have to have an employee of the month which is kind of a feel good thing

[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.680]
Like hey, we want to recognize you did something good for us

[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.820]
Here's a couple hundred bucks or the pin but you better take the pin because if you take the money, you'll never get it again. So whatever

[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.760]
But to use it

[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.880]
politically and to go out of your way to ignore the people who take a lot of crap every day of their lives

[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:33.480]
Who really try very hard to do a country job who've been lied to on and on and on and get nothing but crap and more crap just constantly

[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.160]
Is very demoralizing and don't go blame it on me because I just read the damn memo

[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:44.380]
It came about somebody handed to me and it came in here and I read it on the year and now people are pissed off over there

[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:50.540]
And it's not because a hank it's not a personal thing with him. Oh, it is. No, it's not. Oh, well, but the riddance or not. That's not the point

[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:56.760]
The point that it suggests another way to keep them under the thumb and to stick them down

[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:01.500]
You're not important. You mean nothing and you know don't expect the raise or any promotion in the straw

[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.140]
We don't care about you people just keep taking all the crap we can dish out in the bug off

[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.000]
Two open lines and grow it here flat line

[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.540]
Here's Davey hello

[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.560]
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're doing it. Okay. Uh, yeah

[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:23.520]
Comment and observation about yesterday's dolphin game. Uh, uh, these yonks is called Miranda. That's the sure

[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.900]
Um, but also I was just wondering if anybody has an observation about if he browns calls

[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.080]
Uh, about running people who was left side on third short every time

[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.800]
There's a more flight you could uh, you know, can I ask you a question

[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:43.600]
I'm I'm the only person that watches the way Dan Reno hands the ball off on every running plane

[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.340]
Am I the only one who has any criticism of that or is everybody else one? Oh, absolutely not now

[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:54.540]
After running play guys the whole stadium can see it the bills and the defense whoever we're playing can see it

[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.820]
The whole audience watching on TV can see it

[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.620]
Absolutely and you watch it these other

[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.760]
Backspotty you don't know but he's gonna scream over any of what's a guy they're banana people have to make some danger

[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:08.220]
Right that's right. Yeah, marino. He's what you can get over to the running back let alone hand it off

[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.480]
But uh, yeah, I didn't either way one other thing

[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:17.340]
I don't want to make it back from Reno day here under show, but I do want to say that you see the value of a guy like smoothie who is mobile

[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:23.260]
Oh mobile quarterback not a statue for the guy who is mobile can roll out who can run who can do all kinds of things

[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.900]
And yes, Danny did one for that one nine years there and that one desperate late in the game

[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.760]
Which I couldn't credit for that so that's maybe won't be your thing

[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.780]
Not because he's dangerous that's right right. Yeah, I just wondered why they wasn't

[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.180]
Was right. Oh wow, well that might have worked it was bad

[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.420]
But I might have a bit committed bad coaching for this. Oh, absolutely

[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:50.380]
That's the old staff really oh, perhaps off-field they played a really tough game and uh, you know, they did one great game

[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.720]
Really was that was the best thing so far this year. Okay, pal. Okay, but great

[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.960]
I mean, I know a lot of people very disappointed because they hate to build leg boys and then vice versa

[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.300]
They hate the dolphins up there

[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.980]
You gotta admit that was one aspect in game right off down to the last two seconds

[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.880]
Break out of last catch on the four-yard line and guess what and by the way you do realize if the dolphins wouldn't have to

[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.640]
Burn one of their time after that injury late in the game couldn't have been a large time. It's good to the bet

[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.820]
If they wouldn't have had to waste one of their time after that

[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.180]
Would have still had one more time out left and who knows what would happen then but nevertheless

[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.160]
Here's Miami. Hello

[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.920]
Miami. All right. Good morning. Yes, sir. I had a few remarks because I was laughing out loud

[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.720]
But the one gentleman that called you and asked why you bashed Jimmy

[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.500]
Gentlemen was just called basically you know, I agree with him

[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:41.440]
You should have just fun to the mere fact that we had a touchdown just early in the game. I was surprised

[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.220]
That was a miracle of the fact that I got any touch

[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.220]
That's what he's got. I know. It's a way to waste a lot. We're often

[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.300]
He's been working. I mean that's terrible. We finally got a seven point lead

[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.680]
We do have a pretty good defense on it

[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.060]
Get the ball as far as possible. He didn't even a high school coach knows

[00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:01.040]
You know fourth and an inch or a foot or whatever it is on your own 36-yard line early in a ball game

[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.840]
I mean you don't act like you're doing something out of desperation. You can't wish on me anything

[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:11.880]
But that was in Dallas. He has not done a damn thing in Miami. Yeah, not one thing. So basically you're saying

[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.260]
He's a great coach for what he did out of the Poland

[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.220]
Hmm. It's ridiculous. Yeah, we show me what you did lately. That's the way it should be

[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.720]
And last remark I must say I hate it flui

[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:28.900]
The ever since that hurricane BC game. I love it. Yeah, and I hate the bills with my hats off

[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.860]
I start saying Hail Mary's every time I see him

[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.920]
I have a hit play at a great game. It really deserves a credit. Okay. Thanks for the at least being out of spell

[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.260]
Have a great day. There's an honest caller right there. Let's hear it

[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.460]
There were a couple are at the end of the worst thing this morning. Why does the bitter end?

[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.900]
Who told it exactly the way it was but in this time you have to kind of like color everything and uh

[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.760]
Make people feel a little bit better about their lives

[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:55.380]
Yes, sir comment on your fitness games and on Jimmy Johnson really where was Jimmy Johnson left with

[00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:01.740]
Which means what when when we um when he took over the team it will pull a full of overpriced

[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:07.660]
Creatures like Eric Green and yeah, did Eric Green make the decision to go for it on fourth and one inch or another

[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.920]
35 yard line. Let's be honest. They'll figure a thing in the ass and somebody else's plan

[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.300]
They have their playing grab ass on that phone two open lines at day one and wireless line

[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.760]
How come he wasn't making those excuses and Dallas when it came in following a one and 15 year huh

[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.920]
Here's a mobile and west Palm Beach. Hello

[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.000]
How are you doing now? Okay, sir

[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.860]
I'm glad I'm not the only one that sees what Dan marino is doing out there

[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.740]
The guy plays like he has to mention his legs and cementing his shoes. Yeah

[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.860]
Um yesterday with that call

[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:41.100]
The call if he was gonna go for it was a quarterback faith, but he can't use damn marino to do it

[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:47.120]
I think the I think Jimmy Johnson is at a catch-22. I think he would love to pull damn marino out of there

[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.040]
And who's gonna put in?

[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:52.020]
Okay, he can't even put in Zinn head. He's injured. Good. How's he got to put in there?

[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.080]
He got to put somebody in there that can move he means the mobile quarterback

[00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:00.060]
I mean the look on how come for the last five years that I've been saying on a show the rare very few times

[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:00.960]
I talk about football

[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.500]
But how come when I do and I say that they ought to be thinking about grooming a young successor

[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.900]
That's a cool marino a young

[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.260]
In fact, I heard who that was talking. He's a vote camber manager about Brian Greasey

[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:15.280]
What a great move that would have been but I mean they've absolutely they've got three like they think marino's gonna play forever

[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.640]
You know, everybody has the

[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:23.420]
Gojones to make the move. They're afraid damn marino is like God and he's not he had a great faith

[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.320]
If they can't look at that game, he built a front line in front of them

[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.580]
He's got a good offensive line protect them. He still can't do it

[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.040]
And I said in the end people are soft for one they want to go to a superbowl

[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.700]
I want to win a division championship

[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:40.360]
They're gonna think about it. They're open after right. They can make all the excuses they want

[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:45.160]
The marino was good. I think I think we better co-author a book called life after Danny

[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.020]
I mean, there really is gonna have to be at some day a lot of people don't want to have to face that day

[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.560]
But they will have to be a day in Miami life after Danny if they're such a thing

[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:58.420]
Uh-huh. We have an open line at broward 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.980]
We want to personally apologize to our friends a bit of insurance free if we have any for the fact that Greg

[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:09.260]
Read is an insulin to asshole. Okay. We just has no in-dram. He just just no common sense whatsoever

[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.480]
Just no concept of the troops

[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:16.260]
But once we're off there in the third floor. He tells me that it's gonna all be a lot better. Anybody buy in that?

[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:16.500]
No

[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.180]
Then we'll really get some communication going then we'll really have a program director

[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.820]
He's got to get involved in assisting us on. I showed we believe that no he called you this morning. Is he back?

[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:26.500]
I don't know if he's back yet.

[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.920]
Okay, excuse me

[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.180]
Here's a mobile in Delray Beach. Hello. Yeah, hello, Dale. Yes, sir

[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:41.240]
Uh, that must be the same asshole that it uh, that the ads from Charlton Henson and the NRA uh

[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:47.000]
Runs on your station. Sir, let me say this to you. Okay. Whatever ads are run on this radio station

[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.540]
People are paying for and whether those of us on here agree with them or don't agree

[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:56.040]
People are entitled to buy ads. Then you can't turn them down. It's for those are political ads. You can't say no

[00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.780]
I understand but uh, you know when they misrepresent the uh

[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:06.940]
For your end, sir. I understand that but let me say it again. You can't turn down political ads and you can't uh, you know

[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:12.040]
Talk through the political ads and you whether we agree with them or not. I understand you and have a great day

[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.380]
We have two open lines in brown word five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the AT&T

[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.300]
I mean, I'm gonna I should probably be a consummate professional and start screaming and yelling when next time

[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:25.360]
We go over those thoughts on here and then maybe I'll get the uh thing next month

[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.760]
Here's Fort Myers. Hello

[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.900]
Good morning, Neil. How you doing? Okay, sir

[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:35.380]
Say I'm heading back down to uh, Marian Kia. I was wanting to know if you want to come with me

[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.600]
I'll buy you take it first class American Airlines

[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.480]
Burian Kia. Yeah

[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.420]
That's pretty close to cut the Hannah

[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:46.820]
But we'll take a Jeep and we'll go toward the baroncus this time around okay. See in the bonkers

[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:54.720]
Which is right next to the oncus we have an open line in uh date five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:01.520]
Here's a mobile in Pembert Pine so that must have been Terry Murray doing a voice mobile in Pembert Pine. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir

[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.540]
Yeah, these guys need to be held accountable just like everybody else like to me George anybody else in this world

[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.460]
That was a bonehead decision Johnson made to go forward at that point in the game

[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.840]
One of the worst coaching decisions I've seen by any coach in recent years in the whole league just

[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.680]
Unconscionable it was awful. He put the same crap a couple weeks ago when it was we were down by at 10

[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.980]
Let's go for a two point conversion after the touchdown

[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.920]
It ended being down by four in your own glad you may I've forgotten all about that it was inexplicable

[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:32.540]
I meant nothing it was like everybody was saying why is he doing that it means nothing and everything suspect and walk on water

[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.900]
But he's done some terrible things. Yeah, I think he's losing it and far as Danny

[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.120]
I mean he just he's hanging out that's ridiculous

[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:43.620]
That's the exact game you hit from behind fumble game over yeah, like down there on a 15-yard line

[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.560]
I mean he's done wonderful things here for a lot of years

[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.820]
I mean he's you know put up a lot of great stats and he goes out there and the places brings out to the best of his ability

[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:56.600]
But there comes a time when you got to start looking through the future and I just don't see them doing that now

[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.300]
He does have a lot of heart but looking sky like

[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:04.240]
Flutey and Steve young all those guys. Yeah, mediocre arms the mobile and anything's happened instead of a statue back there

[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.660]
I you know I still am I'm dying to know whether to laugh or cry after you hear all this stuff that was said on this

[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.780]
Station about flutey last week and I I've seen him play a lot including when he played for a Toronto

[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.420]
They are going out to the CFL this kid's unbelievable. Yeah, that's more more tapered to his game up

[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:21.840]
There was a wider field too. He did tear it up in addition, which don't forget up there. They've only got three downs

[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.020]
You know, it's one two and you're out. It's not not like down here when you got four downs. They've only got three

[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:30.760]
Downs to play with up there. Sure, well maybe we could trade Dan up there for a grizzly bear. Okay, talk to you later

[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:38.080]
This is sac religious is what it is. Okay. That's what the mad dog is going to be saying next teammate time

[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.100]
He's on here. This is downright sac religious

[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.780]
I don't think he minds if you're not good Jimmy

[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:47.020]
But don't be knocking Danny book as man is good to real upset and Joe Rose becomes a

[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.040]
Beligment and gets his brother in line involved not Danny boy

[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.700]
We love you Danny, but we'll see you

[00:27:54.260 --> 00:28:01.900]
All provided Broward 5 670 560.560 on the 18t line 21 before noon QAM. Hank will be here from Shuler State 2-2

[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:07.060]
Then we got the book shambi there with the orange here from 6-7 and then we got the panther game 7 o'clock

[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.820]
Don't forget turn the radio down turn it on because then you could be honest and pretend you're listening

[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:15.500]
But just turn the sound down and turn on the sports channel at all 82 games are in sports channel by the way

[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.900]
Panthers and the islanders in Nassau

[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.160]
Boy

[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:24.340]
I'm sorry. They don't draw flies up there. I mean it makes no difference. They just don't care

[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.800]
They only got 12 million people to draw from up there in New York. They do not draw flies

[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.880]
They had their great championships years ago. They had Denise Paz van. They had all that good to know

[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.360]
It's another story. They don't care

[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.660]
Hey, you want a great cigar effect?

[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:37.380]
I

[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:42.300]
Stop it. Where's my gun?

[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:42.920]
Yes

[00:28:48.500 --> 00:29:01.680]
Oh, all right. Okay, I'm 45 at 560. You know, I'll tell you one thing when you accumulate over a period of 200-300 years

[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.280]
We got a song for everything in here. You know what? Somebody takes a bad VM

[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.260]
We got a song and we have four songs for that

[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:13.180]
I know if you have a song for this though wait till you're there somebody brought this by it Benninger is on Saturday

[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.620]
Just to show you how free this is in America

[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:24.220]
The Fort Lauderdale Police Department has developed a bicycle registration program that will keep track of all the bicycles registered to city residents

[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:28.860]
Registration is optional for non-residents who ride into the city of Fort Lauderdale

[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.100]
Oh

[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:39.520]
What is the purpose of the program the purpose of this program is to reduce the number of bicycle stolen and assist the police in the recovery of stolen bicycles now

[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.460]
We're waiting to hear this

[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:49.440]
How much of this registration cost the cost of initial registration is one dollar if your decal becomes lost or stolen will cost an additional dollar to replace

[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:55.600]
What happens if I don't register my bike a police officer may take it into possession and impound any bicycle

[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:03.160]
Being operated or possessed on all streets roads highways alley sidewalks or other rights of way upon which the city has the authority to enforce traffic laws and ordinances

[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.820]
When the bicycle does not have a task there to a bicycle registration decal

[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:11.780]
What happens to my bicycle if it is impounded the police department may keep the bicycle impounded

[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:19.960]
I'm till the owner obtains a bicycle registration decal or shows proof of ownership pays all applicable civil fines and completes any required

[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.720]
Community service hours

[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:34.200]
With the 90 days after such impound and if the owner is not registered the bicycle or requested its return showing satisfactory proof of ownership the bicycle shall be considered

[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:41.860]
Unclaimed evidence and the city may be tainted bicycle for its use transfer the bicycle to another governmental entity donate the bicycle to a charitable organization or sell the bicycle

[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.320]
What if I'm a non-resident do not register my bike in Fort Lauderdale?

[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:53.520]
Well the police department shall make every reasonable effort to verify out of city residency and in the event residency cannot be established

[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.260]
The bicycle shall be handled as an in city non registered bicycle and may be impounded

[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.960]
Do I need to bring anything with me when I register my bicycle?

[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.680]
Yes, you'll need satisfactory proof of ownership for your bicycle if you don't have proof of ownership

[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.800]
It required to sign a sworn apetite which will be notarized at the so what does that mean?

[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:17.780]
You get like a registration with your bike like you do with your car. No, I don't think so with your I'm talking about like a

[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.340]
Pricicle a two-wheeler a whatever it is a four-wheeler and eight-wheeler

[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.480]
any Wheeler

[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:24.800]
Wow

[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:32.400]
The registration decal will make your bicycle less attractive to bike fees in the event that your bicycle is still stolen by having a registered

[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:38.500]
You're more likely to ever return by the police at the impound let's hear it. It's only like 600 hours community service. That's not too bad

[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:44.440]
So govern yourselves accordingly in Fort Lauderdale. We've got the bicycle Nazis now

[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:50.300]
Open line in Dave County five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t wireless line

[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.560]

[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:57.720]
Hey, I'll just go to the old feedback for you on mr. Marino and I'd like to talk on that reference to the handoff

[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.220]
I he does it the man

[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:04.140]
Uh, seat feels scared of getting hit up courses that as you don't want to get hit getting a lot of money

[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.980]
But you got to go out there and risk it and and gamble. I think he

[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.040]
What does that have to do with handing the ball off?

[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:19.260]
Just once that ball there's the gas the guy to grab it as soon as they can to get it out of his hand. Yeah, he doesn't get hit

[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:24.440]
So hold it a little longer hide a little better. You know, you know, a little more you getting good money

[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.860]
Uh, let's show a little more. I think he if you notice when he gets pressure, you get pressured

[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.100]
He he throws a ball and he doesn't he's not on target

[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.800]
He gets rid of it too quickly. Well, I mean if you want to start

[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.820]
I mean you're getting carried away and just knocking everything that he does. I think you're way out of line

[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:42.460]
I think he's an excellent. Don't be something to me. We're talking about the handoff and I'm just giving you my thoughts

[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.640]
And I wanted to thank to see what you thought about that

[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:50.680]
He's like well, he's got all the time in the world and I'm at the part part of your offense and football has got to be

[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.300]
Deception and you can't you can't fool the defense

[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.940]
You can't pull anybody the goddamn stadium or in the universe watching on TV when you're holding it out there

[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.700]
Like a loaf of bread and everybody where the running plate are all screaming like run, you know

[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.500]
And it's not it's not to affect the Danny. I'm sorry

Fishy finances by Andrew Symbolist no relation to f from junior

[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:18.680]
In short, what appears to be a 29.3 million dollar operating loss in 1997 becomes a profit of 13.8 million

[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.220]
It says and it's alleged

[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:27.280]
But he's never got enough because he's a poor guy from the atrash business. What do you want? He's a garbage guy

[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:43.880]
You I mean much of a bull crap all the main garbage for watching the emotional cripples right? I gotta I gotta quick story for you. I got a friend

[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:49.740]
Uh, his name is Ron. He's listening right now and he took his kid trick or training

[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:57.780]
He's a little kid when I'm talking a little black kid and told him Superman is not black. Superman is white. Anything about that Superman is white

[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:02.240]
No, he's got a confused with the editor of the newspaper. That was Perry White. What's wrong with you, man

[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:07.540]
That was the only white guy now. I thought it was Perry White the rest of the moral dark. That was his first in his paper

[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:12.620]
Tells wrong with this guy. I'm not gonna have to play that Christopher Reed thing that tastes the thing again am I? Uh-huh

[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:18.060]
We have an open line in day one and brown at 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line

[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:23.320]
We had good response by the way on the DNH stickers and buttons and post-eat-dollar course

[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:28.360]
It was free but never left it over enthusiastically about that and it's very simple. Do no harm DNH. What does it mean?

[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.980]
That's your religion do no harm

[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.520]
Don't steal other people's property. Don't hurt anybody. That's it

[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:38.280]
Don't mess with children. Don't mess with other people's wives other unless uh, it's you know

[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:43.940]
Unless it's okay, but do no harm. That's it. That's the philosophy of life. You don't have to read all the great philosophers

[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:47.940]
You don't have to read the Bible all this double talk that that that that all this crap

[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:57.480]
It's a bunch of bull crap for emotional cripples for people who are juvenile for people who are desperate for people who need a security blanket like linus

[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:04.420]
And it's also a good excuse for not doing anything constructive while we're alive while we're busy destroying the goddamn planet

[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:08.840]
That's always a good excuse. Well, a lord will take care of that. He did it. Who could have a job these days by the way?

[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:13.600]
Maybe he's busy out there out his face working on the other planet like maybe he's working on your ringus

[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.240]
Here's Miami hello

[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:23.780]
Yeah, hello. Yes, sir. I know why a marino pads the ball like that way. He had it. Is it like that when he hands it off when he sticks his arm out

[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:30.040]
Yeah, they said they were commentators said that uh, he does it to draw the defense with the left to the right. Oh really

[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:38.500]
Ah sure works good on it. No, it's not at all. Okay. Thank you. Okay. He does it to draw the defense to suck the defense. Yeah, it sucks

[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:44.080]
Very embarrassing. Okay, a little bit of deception would be a lot more effective. I think I couldn't be wrong Danny

[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:50.080]
I'm no expert. I mean, I've only been watching football 42 years, but a little bit of deception or a little bit of trickery might be a little more effective

[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:56.380]
Two open lines and date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t wireless line

[00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:01.400]
See, this is a town where certain people in sports can do any goddamn thing out of the sun

[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.940]
And right away there'll be 50,000 people lining up to make an excuse for it and to explain it and rationalize it and tell you it was great

[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:11.260]
Like the asshole before that said it was a what did he say a gutsy moved by uh Jimmy

[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:13.180]
gutsy

[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:22.600]
They they should have had this team side kayak rest out there on a sideline within 30 seconds after you just said go for it on fourth and one inch on his own 36 yard

[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.900]
The team shrank should have been out there he should have been shrinking it

[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.100]
Here's a mobile in call spring. Hello

[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.340]
Neil yes sir

[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:35.220]
Yes, uh, what the guy said before was true. I seen it on

[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:41.580]
TV about Danny handoff Jimmy telling them to do that if you look at the old days of

[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:48.340]
Danny marino he didn't hand the ball off like that. Yeah, it's uh Jimmy's bright. I want to know there's Jimmy thing

[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:53.020]
There's Jimmy bright idea. Uh, if you look at the way marino used to know it

[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:58.740]
He didn't do it like that Jimmy come up with this great idea of he's gonna fool the defense with that

[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:02.920]
Oh, yeah, and I thought maybe he'd run a little play action office like look at me

[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.700]
I'm gonna hand the ball off right there you go like I said a little deception right little trickery little bit

[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:13.240]
Not quite so obvious right no such thing you know they got fourth in them and ain't you think they do a little quarterback

[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:18.640]
No, you wouldn't say they wouldn't think they would do anything you think that they would punt like anybody with a brain would do not

[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:23.180]
Fourth of the ninja on your own 36 yard line sir even a three-year-old child knows you wouldn't do that

[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.620]
And embryo a fetus knows that you wouldn't do that

[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.500]
But does Jimmy know it? No

[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.900]
We have it all and then then of course they're gonna be those assholes are gonna say well

[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.780]
You know if it would have worked and they would have driven out or guess what it didn't

[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:42.600]
That's a calculated risk you have to make it you don't do it on your own 36 yard line when you have all the momentum

[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:47.640]
Going your way in a ball game then you just open the door and let the other team right back in all okay here you go

[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:52.500]
We lost two yards and now you're on our 34-yard line and they just happened to march down the field

[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.560]
Ampli takes him in for a touchdown, which has the time to fight again and let him right back in the game

[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:03.920]

I know for my pussy

[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.340]
All right

[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.980]
I climbed to my house

[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.360]
The

[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.620]
they

[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:16.620]

[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.720]
them

[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.220]
Although

[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:24.220]
Oh, push, push, push, push, push, push, kitty kitty kitty, my cat fell in the web

[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:39.060]
Then I was a pussy that could quite come where with her

[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:43.380]

Provo 2 at 560 WQM having Monday 2.

[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.440]
I think 4L today we ought to start thinking about since they want all the methods of transportation

[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:25.080]
to be registered your automobile, your motorbike, your whatever.

[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:28.400]
And now your bicycle, how about registering your shoes?

[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:29.420]
That's not good.

[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.760]
I mean that's a method of transportation is walking.

[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.040]
And every now and then you'll be driving down the road you'll see like a shoe on the

[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:36.820]
side of the road, huh?

[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.660]
Sneaker or shoe, whatever the hell it is.

[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.180]
Let's register our shoes in 4L today.

[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:49.420]
We have two open lines in date 560, 560 and Tom 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.540]
Here's a mobile in the Gables.

[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:51.840]
Hello?

[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:53.360]
Hi Neil.

[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:54.100]
Yes sir.

[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.840]
I have to agree with you 100% on Jimmy.

[00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:02.700]
I think he has shown nothing since he's come here and is one of the worst game day coaches in the league.

[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.840]
He did the same thing two, three weeks to go against Jacksonville.

[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:10.000]
We had the ball pretty much control the game with high game.

[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.660]
We had the ball deep in Jacksonville territory.

[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.960]
Fourth and three are fourth and four.

[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.060]
They're 35, 36 yard line.

[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:24.900]
And instead of planting, sending them deep or going forth then he goes for a 54-yard deal goal.

[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:31.940]
And I mean that goes totally against Jimmy's whole philosophy of playing field position football.

[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:32.160]
Yeah.

[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.120]
He's maintaining control.

[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:42.200]
Paul, yeah, I guess he wants to be known as the gutsy coach for the problem is there almost all his gutsy calls blow up in his face and they might have losing games because of him.

[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:42.720]
Exactly.

[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:46.040]
But the coach again he has a philosophy that he doesn't even stick to.

[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:46.260]
Yeah.

[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:46.860]
Stick to it.

[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:52.960]
Yesterday, like you said, I mean only has to do his punch a ball and maintain control of the game.

[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:59.620]
To give them a blow on the 33 or 34-yard line of Miami at that point of the game was like shooting himself in a foot.

[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:00.440]
It's a turnover.

[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:02.740]
It's the equivalent of an intersection of football.

[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.080]
That's right.

[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.120]
And just one more thing.

[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:11.760]
With regard to the guy who said that Dan is scared to hand the ball up, I'm not saying Dan's a smooth ball handler.

[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:16.040]
But he certainly didn't hand it off like that because he's scared to get hurt.

[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.220]
Anyone who's been playing 16 years in the NFL.

[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:21.440]
Oh, we know we fought on that to Jimmy deal with another brainstorm by Jimmy.

[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:22.400]
Correct.

[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:24.240]
They said to the paper on the offseason.

[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.700]
They said that Jimmy is teaching Dan a new way to throw a ball.

[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.900]
He's teaching how to be an F. Nice coach.

[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.080]
Yeah, we're in those here.

[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:31.520]
Okay.

[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:32.320]
There you go.

[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.140]
Taking a Hall of Fame quarterback and teaching him how to lose.

[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.640]
Well, we're five and three.

[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:37.740]
Okay, I believe you.

[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:38.380]
They're doing great.

[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:40.140]
And it was a great game.

[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.040]
We have an open line and they wanted a round one line.

[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.520]
Organizers worked for months together.

[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:50.520]
The 46,764 signatures in Las Vegas needed to put medical marijuana initiative on November ballot.

[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.580]
But election officials who checked the petition said it fell short by 43 names.

[00:45:54.580 --> 00:46:02.920]
After Americans for medical rights asked for a recount official discovered a chemical in marijuana may protect grain cells from the effective.

[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.200]
Is what?

[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:04.900]
Right.

[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:05.940]
You spread your case.

[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:06.860]
Oh, I say, okay.

[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:07.400]
Thank you.

[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:07.800]
Right.

[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:10.360]
You spread your case until we can really deep six all the public education.

[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:10.760]
Great.

[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:11.880]
Thank you.

[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:12.180]
Goodbye.

[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.480]

[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:25.220]

[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:25.680]
Now we're done.

[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:27.100]
We've got a couple of calls left on.

[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:27.800]
Here's Miami.

[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:29.060]

[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:29.700]
Neil.

[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:30.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.000]
Hey, it's Bruce.

[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:31.600]
Joey's friend.

[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.020]
I brought you some stuff in the past.

[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:35.260]
Joey's friend?

[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:35.640]
Yeah.

[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.100]
To get you better.

[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.120]
Oh.

[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.860]
A couple of years ago at the old building.

[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.120]
Drug pedler, yeah.

[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:41.640]
There you go.

[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.020]
Now this is a pharmaceutical guy.

[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:43.260]
Okay.

[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:43.880]
Detail man.

[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:44.600]
Don't get nervous.

[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:48.140]
What I don't understand is I'm watching the golf and the game yesterday.

[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:54.020]
And when he goes for it, I think it was going to be a throw to the running back from the past.

[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.060]
He'll be going up.

[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.520]
And why he ran it.

[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.160]
Everybody knew he was going to run it.

[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:02.000]
And I figured he was going to do a shot on the Buffalo building.

[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:02.960]
He didn't do it.

[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.000]
It just doesn't make sense.

[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:11.060]
And every time they throw it, they got yardage on the run.

[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.620]
You know, you're going to let that one flutty play where he like fake the run and then you threw the theft on pass

[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:17.040]
and the wide open receiver in the end zone.

[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.720]
I think we've picked everybody out of their job.

[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.440]
And I know you hate to hurricane, but I'll tell you what.

[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.180]
But I've got him back on track.

[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:23.400]
Okay.

[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:24.280]
Have a great day pal.

[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:27.300]
Now they wanted to.

[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.980]
I'm talking about the dolphin game only because it was a very exciting.

[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:31.620]
I'm not turning this into a sports show.

[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.480]
I don't care about books.

[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:33.780]
They played a girl school again.

[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:34.100]
Okay.

[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.660]
I said they'd have 30,000.

[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.580]
They have 32,000.

[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:37.580]
I was pretty glad to end close.

[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:39.300]
And it's a total fandom thing over there.

[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:39.580]
Okay.

[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:40.860]
Sorry.

[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:41.520]
Not interested.

[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:43.280]
Two open lines.

[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.340]
And day two and Broward.

[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.820]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.400]
Pomp 5 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:49.220]
Eight minutes past noon.

[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:50.260]
A Q8.

[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:51.300]
A RSI.

[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.260]
Big bow.

[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.780]
I'm a little island full of gay romance.

[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.180]
They wear gay samples and they wear tight pants.

[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.220]
Sundance after bottom every day.

[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.060]
Bless with the miracle of being gay.

[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.560]
The very best of habits in the USA.

[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.020]
Giving big, big pleasure and a big, big way.

[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:15.640]
The very best of habits in the USA.

[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:19.100]
Giving big, big pleasure and a big, big way.

[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.760]
Yeah, I feel.

[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.180]
Going the big way to Chesafield, Queen.

[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.260]
You choice of the bags of America.

[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:29.940]
Call 13 at 560 WQ.

[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.180]
Next to our company is organizing a shipment of...

[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.160]
It's big enough to help by the way.

[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.700]
And I was just dawned on me over the weekend.

[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:35.760]
I don't know why I'm so slow.

[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.600]
But after I left Ben and Jerry's there in Aventure on Saturday.

[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:39.780]
And we had a good turn out.

[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.220]
We collected 1750 bucks.

[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:41.800]
They're not bad.

[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.060]
But it dawned on me that one of the reasons

[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.180]
that I'm really pushing and depleting and squeezed

[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.400]
on the center one thing this year.

[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.080]
This is the first time I've ever done this completely by myself.

[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:50.900]
I'm here.

[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.160]
We had the best of Phil.

[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:53.320]
We had the best of reconcerned.

[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.860]
We had those guys going out doing appearances.

[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:56.300]
We had like a team effort.

[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.100]
And I'm looking at these partial totals that we have

[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:02.040]
over there are six borders that haven't reported yet.

[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.280]
So I know we're over 50 grand.

[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:05.820]
But our total is still 49,855.

[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.700]
The 1117 bucks on the internet, by the way.

[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:10.620]
That's great.

[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.520]
That is sensational.

[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.220]
So thanks again to Eric and Orlando.

[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:15.340]
Neowigis.com.

[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.820]
You can order the best of stuff right over the internet on the website.

[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.740]
So it's a one pony show.

[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:22.480]
And sitting here looking at these numbers.

[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.620]
I'm really depressed because that's not the only conviction there's so much about

[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:26.800]
because I'm telling you the way it is.

[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:27.360]
It's unacceptable.

[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.120]
It is unacceptable.

[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.320]
It's called life in a vacuum.

[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.200]
I mean, I realized when I came over here,

[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.420]
they have the states and sports the other 20 hours of this.

[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.720]
But nevertheless, I worked with a lot of these people before.

[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:40.680]
DeFo and Hank.

[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:41.480]
And this one and that one.

[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:42.960]
A lot of these folks.

[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.000]
And yet somehow between 10 and 2,

[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:49.040]
it's like we're a total of island here where like radio in a vacuum.

[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.520]
And so we're running a campaign in a vacuum here.

[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.040]
And try to raise money for charity.

[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.300]
I mean, just stop and think about it.

[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.840]
Now, one just by osmosis.

[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.900]
Somebody, remember the other place the way it used to be?

[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.500]
People were wandering the sales manager.

[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.460]
This one, that one, people from the news department.

[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.100]
Here's 50 bucks, here's 10 bucks.

[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.100]
Here's the check for 100.

[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.000]
Whatever they could afford.

[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.280]
And again, I can't coerce nor do I want to.

[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:15.540]
I don't believe in raising money that way.

[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.080]
And try to embarrass people into getting it.

[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.540]
But you would think that by now, after all, I've talked about it.

[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:22.960]
Somebody somewhere in his building from management all the way down to Totempool.

[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:24.900]
Will it come up with something?

[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.140]
Have they done it?

[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:30.620]
No.

[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:36.480]
She says, this is, this is such a bogus effing place, man.

[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:40.580]
Oh, yeah, go ahead and spin your magic in there, Neal.

[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:41.360]
We're not going to give you anything.

[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.300]
Just spin your magic.

[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:43.480]
We'll spin that money in here.

[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:44.640]
It's the big old money wheel.

[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.640]
The Neal Roger's money wheel.

[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.620]
This is, I might as well be God, brokering the time here.

[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:50.020]
You know what?

[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.520]
Probably mind if I'm making a hell of a lot more, because we're making them a lot more than they're paying us.

[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:56.580]
Or be brokering the God damn time.

[00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:02.240]
Because we have no way, shape, connection, affiliation, anything.

[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:04.960]
What are right to this God damn place the other 20 hours a day.

[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:09.260]
I mean, they mentioned that we're here, but basically that's about it.

[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.960]
So once again, it's a one pony show and we're doing the best we can.

[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:20.780]
Oh, man, that, that, that crossed my ass almost as much as that bonus thing.

[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:23.880]
Which is unacceptable.

[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:28.620]
I mean, the only places, you know, started the I and Z when they put me on them today.

[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.400]
And I got to his gigantic numbers at that point.

[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.740]
They put a bonus in my contract.

[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.900]
Did I have a problem collecting the bonus on time then?

[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.220]
No.

[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.220]
And I think that was within five days after the book came out.

[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:40.800]
I would do those nine years under cost and taxis that I ever once,

[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:42.720]
any waiting period, have a trouble getting a bonus here.

[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:42.920]
No.

[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.040]
It was something you never even thought about.

[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:45.960]
It was automatic.

[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.220]
It was like falling off a log.

[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.420]
It was like getting out of bed in the morning.

[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.300]
But here every time it's a little something out of the ordinary,

[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:56.000]
whether you record a spot or whether no matter what it is,

[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.880]
it's like a little game that the beesleaves and Greg read play here.

[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:01.160]
We'll pay you when we're good and ready.

[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:01.980]
When we get around to it.

[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:05.720]
And we'll pay George if and when we get around to it.

[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.240]
Okay.

[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.820]
We have an open line in Broward, all three.

[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:10.860]
Mobile in West Palm Beach.

[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:11.060]
Hello.

[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.540]
Mobile in West Palm.

[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:14.300]
Hello.

[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:14.860]
Yes, sir.

[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.000]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:16.520]
Okay.

[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:17.760]
All right.

[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:18.240]
Listen.

[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:24.180]
Maybe a few months ago, and I call you and I give you a play by play.

[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:28.320]
How will a game of Miami will sound in Spanish?

[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:29.000]
Mm-hmm.

[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.980]
And I live in Broward, so I don't really get that SAP lines.

[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.860]
So I can listen to the game and start this further mind and body

[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:37.900]
mission for yourself.

[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:40.300]
The key out for the game is on CMQ in Spanish.

[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:42.380]
You can turn on the Spanish radio and turn it on the SAP TV.

[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:47.200]
There is a Spanish station and an F-rams that it has to game.

[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:48.640]
CMQ, right?

[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:49.740]
WCMQ, right.

[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:50.880]
Oh, okay.

[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:51.360]
I didn't know.

[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:52.920]
Well, I'm sorry.

[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:53.420]
I told you.

[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.460]
Well, this is the whole thing.

[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.460]
I went to my first house.

[00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:02.620]
I mean, I had to beg him to shut the radio off and listen to the game in English.

[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:03.040]
Yeah.

[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:04.400]
Okay, thank you.

[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:05.240]
Okay, that's it.

[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.220]
We have one call after the board and then we'll go to a...

[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.960]
We'll play the Miami Dolphin Zone in the rest of the day.

[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:10.120]
See if we can't get these people in.

[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:14.220]
But little out of their door rooms here today, man, it seemed like they're down in the dumps.

[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:16.160]
It's only one person dangerous, right, Cenk?

[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:16.620]
Miami.

[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:17.560]
There you go.

[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:18.460]
Oh, it went over here.

[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:19.220]
Come on, let's go ahead.

[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.140]
We show.

[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.720]
Okay, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:27.620]
We got two open-line.

[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:28.320]
Here we go.

[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:29.600]
Somebody just shot us right in the back.

[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:34.480]
And put 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.600]
Any interest out there today?

[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:35.860]
No.

[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:39.840]
We actually faked our way along for two hours and 20 minutes today on this God forsaken place.

[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:40.420]
Any interest?

[00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:40.700]
No.

[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.680]
Anybody with anything to say about anything in the world?

[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:42.980]
No.

[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:43.340]
Okay.

[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:45.260]
Just checking.

[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.020]
Here's the mobile import, St. Luizley.

[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:47.260]
Hello?

[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:48.720]
Yes, Neil.

[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:51.760]
I just wanted to say thank you very much for playing, pushing the cell in the well.

[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:52.100]
Yeah.

[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:55.020]
I'm the guy who sent that to you way, way back.

[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:55.360]
Really?

[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:56.780]
Been listening ever since.

[00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:01.240]
And the reason I'm glad you play it is because I lost it.

[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:01.620]
Really?

[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:02.760]
Through a divorce.

[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:03.520]
Uh-huh.

[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:05.720]
So I just wanted to say thank you.

[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:09.580]
Also, I don't know what's with your phone system, but I can hear George talk to you.

[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:10.300]
That's right.

[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:10.960]
That's the way it works.

[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.140]
That's a bonus.

[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:14.680]
That's beautiful.

[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.380]
Anyhow, let me show Belusina for like ever.

[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:18.340]
So take care.

[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:19.540]
Okay, I'll go find the new one.

[00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:20.520]
Well, okay.

[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:25.060]
We have an open line that's powered all three of days on fourth and one that Jimmy Johnson made.

[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.180]
Fourth and one inch, yes.

[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:27.800]
And I wanted to see it.

[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:32.840]
I wanted to point out the irony that after Johnson left Dallas, Switzerland did something similar

[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:35.160]
against Philadelphia several years ago.

[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:40.660]
And I believe Johnson was quoted negatively about that column.

[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:42.480]
He essentially did the same thing yesterday.

[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:44.480]
And this is not Monday morning quarterbacking.

[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.940]
There is just no justification for that call.

[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:48.720]
No, no, no.

[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.600]
It's not anything to do with Monday.

[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:53.640]
But even if they were to won the game, I mean still people would be saying what kind of a bonehead deal was that?

[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:59.140]
But especially when they want to blues in the game by six points, I and turned a whole moment into the game around at that point,

[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.700]
even though they eventually had a ten point lead.

[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.620]
Still, you keep looking back at that point.

[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:06.600]
And I just can't believe the game would have ever been the same if they wouldn't have would have funded there.

[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.840]
And the funny thing is the crowd was already out of the game.

[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.140]
We were up seven, nothing bad.

[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:13.360]
But the momentum was with Miami, that's correct.

[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:19.300]
I mean, to use the excuse of saying we had to get the crowd out again is like saying, well, you know, if they got any momentum at all,

[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.540]
we knew we were going to lose the game.

[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.140]
That's basically like what are you saying?

[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.140]
Like an issue of your opinion.

[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:25.860]
You really have to question this confidence.

[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.440]
I mean, you know, the dolphins, it seems to me before Jimmy Johnson came here during all the shoeliers,

[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:33.680]
the dolphins had been playing in Buffalo in all those other wild stadiums,

[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:38.140]
where as long as I can recall, and they still had overcome the same crowd and the same noise.

[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.900]
And it's part of the, I'll be on to what you're up again.

[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:44.300]
Hey, do you think Jimmy would pull the goalie out of five on four?

[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:46.420]
Jimmy wouldn't know where five on your reign is.

[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:47.200]
Seven great day pal.

[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.220]
In fact, I think Jimmy Johnson and Terry Murray are the same person.

[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.200]
That's what I think.

[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:55.740]
Two of the most boneheaded calls in the history of coaching over the weekend.

[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.720]
And I shouldn't be talking about it.

[00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:00.480]
That's right. We practice the power play five on four.

[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:01.940]
So that's what we wanted to go with.

[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:04.380]
Oh, I mean, seriously.

[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.920]
I can't believe that people are passing out in their living room right now around the sidewalk,

[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.520]
just hearing me quote that out of the guy in the newspaper.

[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:14.780]
What a lame excuse.

[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.780]
I mean, you sucked them into a stupid penalty.

[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:21.680]
You got a chance to get yourself back in the game, pull off a late miracle like the Anaheim did a couple of nights ago.

[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.940]
And then, oh, no, no, no, thanks. We'll pass.

[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.380]
It's like declining a penalty.

[00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.020]
Well, it's the same football, Terry.

[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.500]
It can't decline a penalty, baby.

[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:32.240]
Here's Cool Springs. Hello.

[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:33.020]
Hey, Neil.

[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:33.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:35.540]
You were taking on a real unpopular subject today.

[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:39.260]
You could have been talking about God in this town when you criticized the dolphin.

[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.500]
But I agree at 1000% what you're saying.

[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:45.060]
And I also think that Dan Marino is not helping the team anymore.

[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:45.360]
Yeah.

[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.620]
The guy was good in his day, but he's old.

[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:49.480]
He can't run when he ran those nine yards.

[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:51.020]
I mean, he was spent the rest of the day.

[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:52.040]
He was hopping and pumping.

[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:52.300]

[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:57.320]
I mean, his legs are like one size from his ankle up to his thigh, because they're all taped and everything else.

[00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:57.480]
Right.

[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:01.520]
And we need to, it's a time we need to start to move towards another direction with a new corner.

[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.320]
But they haven't even talked about that.

[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:04.520]
They've never thought about it.

[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:05.900]
They haven't drafted looking through that.

[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:06.640]
They've done nothing.

[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:06.900]
Nothing.

[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:07.600]
And it's an error.

[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:09.280]
So this man is indestructible.

[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:12.680]
And we all know that like any every single play could be as last.

[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:13.520]
Absolutely.

[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.880]
And what happened is the guy had greatness.

[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.180]
It was started because God out in sports.

[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:22.940]
I mean, what's the, and hockey year ago who retired and still to hide in a game.

[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:25.840]
The match goes when out head Williams, when they were up there.

[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:28.400]
The Marino's hanging on and hanging on and hanging on.

[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:29.640]
And he's starting to look like a hazard.

[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:30.120]
Yeah.

[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:34.040]
And they need to make a make a make a change or anything.

[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.220]
I'm repyring about great athletes.

[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:37.940]
So you got to know when it's time to hang it up.

[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.000]
You got to hang absolutely.

[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:39.440]
Okay.

[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:39.880]
Okay.

[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:40.660]
One quick question.

[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.640]
Right to one comment too.

[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.820]
You made a comment earlier today about the college team on Long Island.

[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:45.400]
They don't draw.

[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:48.240]
Uh, they haven't drawn in years.

[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:48.660]
Right.

[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.880]
But right now there's a big protest going on up there.

[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:51.760]
The thing is crumbling.

[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:56.520]
I know that, but that's a very layman's excuse to fact is before they had any protest about that.

[00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:58.020]
The islanders haven't drawn flies.

[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:00.380]
They had the glory years in the late 70s.

[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:01.660]
Uh, it's pretty sad excuse them.

[00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:01.800]
Yeah.

[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:02.260]
It is.

[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:02.780]
Okay.

[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.120]
And by the way, the devil's on draw either.

[00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:05.660]
Have a great day.

[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:06.800]
Okay.

[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.600]
One line left on the board that's lit.

[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.380]
And all the rest of you did.

[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:10.820]
I guess I better crank up the music here.

[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:11.800]
It is Monday after all.

[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.040]
Five six seven oh five sixty.

[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.760]
Tom five sixty on a mobile one line.

[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:18.900]
Well, these people are bummed out.

[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.460]
They're pissed off and not too fired up.

[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:22.700]
Their lives aren't the same as they used to be.

[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:24.260]
I'll get away to vote tomorrow.

[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:24.980]
They get ready to vote.

[00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:25.240]
No.

[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.480]
Twenty five past noon at five six.

[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.040]
Twenty two eight out.

[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:29.560]
Feel right.

[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:30.000]
Time.

[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:37.380]
Well, I know my sister all my life.

[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:41.300]
That is why she's now my wife.

[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:45.180]
And I think my son may know it too.

[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:48.180]
He's my nephew too.

[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:53.620]
Well, my daddy is my uncle Joe.

[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:55.540]
My mother is my near-ampal.

[00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:58.900]
Weed and buried place to see my first cousin is me.

[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:19.780]
All right.

[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.620]
Twenty five sixty WQM.

[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:24.680]
I'm going to get these numbers from the center one campaign from this last week.

[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:25.680]
Do something good for my birthday.

[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:27.960]
Go on and buy the best of Neal parts one or two or both.

[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.160]
And if you don't want to listen to them, put them in the trash bin.

[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.800]
Okay, but center one can use the twenty bucks.

[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:36.460]
And I'll eat borders all over a brown and Dayton Palm Beach.

[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:39.840]
Or you can call the phone number five six three thirty six hundred and

[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:40.660]
brown call center one.

[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:44.600]
They'll ship them out to you direct nine five four five six three thirty six hundred.

[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:46.480]
Or you can hop right on the internet.

[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:47.600]
Neowinders dot com.

[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:48.240]
It's right on here.

[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.220]
Fight right on the web.

[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.780]
They've lined open five six three five time.

[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:53.280]
Give me that number.

[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:54.080]
Well, call that number.

[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:58.640]
Okay, that's the little you know incentive for it five six seven oh five six the top five

[00:59:58.640 --> 00:59:59.460]
60 on the mobile one.

[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.680]
My mind isn't even here right now.

[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.000]
You know, my mind is something that I'm with this Greg Reed business.

[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.300]
I'll keep thinking to myself.

[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.400]
He's an asshole over and over and over again.

[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.420]
Just keep shooting himself into foot over and over.

[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.080]
It's a surprise that man could still walk.

[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.220]
He's going to be hobbling around.

[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.240]
Here's a mobile in Marguille.

[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:15.480]
Hello.

[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:16.860]
Yeah.

[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:17.480]
Yes, sir.

[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:22.000]
You said this morning that there was even a five-year-old kid with no to pull it

[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.440]
going. Yeah. Well, I got a son of a play girl, a hockey and

[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.840]
marketing. He's seven and he said, me daddy, why doesn't he pull it

[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:32.240]
going? What did I say? There you go. Oh my god, he's

[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.760]
killing us. Can you believe it? At least for

[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:38.320]
I just scored the other night. Yeah, good for him. Yeah, the first game, but then

[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.620]
we were back to figure eights in the second game. Yeah, see I was like, I

[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:44.140]
people asked me on Saturday when we were doing our appearance. Well, how about

[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.500]
that game last night? I said, one game doesn't give me all that.

[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:50.520]
That's not a decent make anyway. That's right. Well, have a good day or make

[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.320]
a career for Robbie. Okay, thank you. So there you go. His seven-year-old kid

[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:57.100]
could be the coach better than Terry Murray. Open line and

[01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:00.680]
Broward, all three in day. We're close to that music. Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:04.980]
Hello? Your new. Yes, sir. What about? I got a

[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:10.940]
share in the quiz. Yeah. Can you play the pipe? The pipe, the pipe

[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.700]
vendor? Okay, we'll work out a pound. You get the pipe out of your

[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:18.540]
foot. Sounds like he's got 40 pounds or something in his foot. Here's Marguer.

[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:22.760]
Hello? Hey, how's it going? Okay, sir. I got a disagree with one of the

[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:26.440]
last call as you said that Marino's not helping the team anymore. I think it's

[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:30.140]
like you stated earlier that Jimmy Johnson is taking a whole of his

[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:33.840]
quarterback and taught him how to lose. I mean, he's put a leash around this guy

[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.300]
so much that he's got no freedom. He can't do anything. The worst decision in

[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:43.160]
the world in my opinion was taking away his audible to read the defense. I

[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.000]
just don't know how you think about that. I agree. Okay. Jimmy wants to call

[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.040]
all the shots. Jimmy's a dictator. He's got an ego bigger than the whole

[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:54.080]
town and we're either going to go up in flames with him or the other way around

[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.900]
and right at the moment, you know, his decisions keep back firing. Well, you know,

[01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:01.700]
it's, you know, if Marino doesn't get the ring, then we know, I don't know if

[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:05.480]
he can put the blame on Jimmy, but you know, you got to look somewhere. So far, he

[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.120]
showed me nothing. Absolutely. Okay, pal. Hey, have a great day. Open line in

[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:13.480]
Broward three and days one line. Here's a mobile in Zierfield. Hello. Hey,

[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:17.220]
Neil, how you doing? Okay, sir. I have to make your feet yourself. But did I hear

[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:21.180]
correctly that during the World Series season of the Marlins, I think I made a

[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:28.900]
profit? Yes. You're kidding me. No, not. Yeah. That falls head. It's pineapple

[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:35.080]
based son of a bitch. Yeah. I mean, I can't. He lost 29.3 million dollars

[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.960]
and instead he lost 13 point eight minutes. And he made 13 point eight minutes. I can't

[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:45.220]
profit. Listen, and that bastard was wanting and bitching about all idea of stadium. I need

[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:51.080]
a stadium. You know, right? And by the way, we heard any more about the John Henry

[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.580]
deal. Is that thing done yet? No. No. That's a prospective buyer for the Panthers. No.

[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:00.180]
It's never going to happen. He's going to sell the Panthers after this season. I guarantee

[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:03.820]
it. Read my list. Oh, I don't think I don't think he was going to want to do that

[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:07.280]
because he's raking in the dough from that arena. Hand over a fist. I mean, he's making

[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:11.000]
a fortune in there with the sky boxes and the club seats and all the other revenue he's

[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.600]
got. He's got. He's got his own joints. We doesn't have to split it with anybody else.

[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:18.300]
He's getting all of that revenue in there. And other than what the county has taken out

[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:22.360]
of it. And he's probably a squeeze it out of there for a couple of years. And you notice

[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.880]
he's not going to go on paying the big bucks for any talent. Listen, Neil, I know he's

[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:31.300]
just thought after this season, you know why? Because first of all, I know that people down

[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:34.760]
here are pretty stupid, but they're not that stupid. They're not going to go. They're

[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.680]
not going to go spending their money and go into a game when there's no product after

[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:41.880]
the first year. Sure. Well, you've got to understand, though, when you get into these

[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.180]
new arenas, so much of it is corporate. Those season tickets in the lower bowl and the club

[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:49.760]
seats and the sweet so much of it is corporate that that's not even having that much of an

[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.440]
impact anymore. So long as the big companies are willing to shell out and keep their season

[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:56.880]
tickets, you watch these other new arenas around the league like the Fleet Center in Boston

[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:03.360]
and so any of the newer arenas, you'll see huge chunks of empty seats dying even right

[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.420]
down low, you know, right, right center rice, enormous chunks. And it's not that they're

[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:11.040]
not paid for because they have been bought for the people of the country because they're

[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:14.360]
corporate seats. That's all. Yeah, they're just not being used. And do you see that money

[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:19.200]
going to go into good going to get a new goalie? No, of course not. The guy's listening,

[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:24.260]
the guy's not going to see dial my money here and feed and close the meal. So up your

[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:29.780]
it, do spag and a half. Okay. Okay. Mobile in deer field will clear the board and

[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:33.400]
then we'll go to music when we come back. Hello. See how you doing. Okay, sir. Have

[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:38.620]
called that failed department. You guys called over there twice to advertise your face.

[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.460]
And I can't get it for turn phone call. They that do that. Do you ask me what business

[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.420]
will I can't return calls? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We have a stand over fist in case you

[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:48.680]
have noticed it's all spots radio. We're going to start a billboard campaign just all spots

[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:54.480]
radio. Which one was that? It's not a new. This is fries. One of the club's hell. Can you

[01:04:54.480 --> 01:05:00.240]
play? I've got one. Okay. Hey, it's out of here. 24 to 1 is there. They don't feel about

[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.880]
that. That's okay. I'll go along with it. Whenever the police come up with that. Okay,

[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:17.540]
with you guys. That's good. And then there were all of them still being nobody. 60.

[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:28.020]
Oh, yeah. Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy? Oh, my God. I'm so embarrassed. I'm so embarrassed.

[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:37.280]
Oh, that feels so good. Yeah. Just roll the ball. There is so much. Oh, my God. I love it.

[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:47.860]
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.940]
241 at 560 W.com. Thanks to Danny the sign painter. Murray's friend from Wayne Arnold's Royal

[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:56.800]
Castle. We're going to have no one nice. Even though he didn't make the picture of me a

[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.820]
little bit on the swishy side. You know, a little on the swishy side. A little bit too much

[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:03.100]
lipstick. I'll even black and white. You can tell where's lipstick. Happy early birthday

[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:07.740]
from Danny the sign painter. Thank you, Danny. Oh, yeah, just okay. We got the 600 open

[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:12.160]
lines 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line. Play one note of music.

[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:18.100]
That's enough. Okay, maybe just subliminally just a thought of it. We'll get them to the

[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.840]
phone, but I doubt it. Well, they got nothing to talk about today. Except they want to

[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:23.260]
probably talk about that damn dolphin game. And I'm sorry, I mentioned it in the first

[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:27.180]
place. We didn't have the one guy who called in who's seven year old son knows more about

[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:30.780]
hockey than the Terry Murray. I'm so unsure. God bless you and your family. The Guns of

[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:35.660]
Mishpothra. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Yeah, hey, I just wanted to remind you, Neil,

[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:41.160]
that George didn't get his bonus yet. No. Yeah. And I think I know we love listening to

[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:45.980]
you, but I think you said you were going to go on a little sick leave or something if

[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:50.820]
you didn't get it. Yeah. Well, the Dreg Reek came down here and said it will be in the

[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:55.460]
next paycheck is like Reg Reed said. But I also like Reg Reed and also today is the day

[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:58.680]
for my bonus. And if the bonus isn't here by two o'clock, I will not be here tomorrow.

[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:03.900]
We'll miss you, but we'll support you. I want to also mention that one of the things

[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:09.140]
that Wayne also inherited or got when he's got the new stadium was the right to all the

[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:13.320]
parking, which certainly has to be about another 70,000 per game as opposed to what he had

[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:17.500]
in day county of the other arena. Right. Oh, yeah, he's rigging it and had over a fifth

[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:21.900]
in this building. No question about it. Yeah. Well, anyways, I just wanted to throw

[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:25.600]
those two asses. Okay, Pat. Have a great life. And that's right. It's a quarter to one.

[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:29.400]
We're still waiting for some word on that bonus, chick. Well, it may be when they may

[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:33.140]
be two days a month, they do it a Saturday or whatever like she said to Godfather. Remember?

[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:39.540]
We have the open line and Broward to and date five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on

[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:44.360]
the mobile one line. Here's Pompano. Hello. Hey, you know, yes, sir. Yeah, my best

[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:48.380]
and that's just he needs the sunrise store. Okay. God bless you. They're in a static.

[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:53.760]
I mean, the ability is so cool. They're so nice store. Yeah. You know, in plantation,

[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:57.960]
they should buy whatever that is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm some like bull tomorrow. Yeah.

[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:01.540]
Yeah. Yeah. I think maybe you could just band carts for a little while. Me

[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:05.700]
little light of fire and people's asses. You know, it's coming for a quest. I'm going to go

[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:14.620]
by the CD. Uh huh. There you go. I, uh, I'm material booking to request. Yeah. You

[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:19.300]
have to go down. Okay. Have a great life. Get out of here. Oh my god. You know, there's

[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:22.700]
no point in pushing it. You people got nothing to say today. They ran out of their material.

[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:26.480]
They did their thing about Jimmy as an asshole and Danny's getting old and fine. Okay.

[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:30.840]
Now what? I mean, I could do my thing about here sugar and the sweet and you the

[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.800]
merc and die. Which you don't want to hear about because see, this audience likes to

[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.640]
eat. They don't want to hear about losing weight, which I'm desperate to do. Oh, and

[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:40.040]
by the way, I want to thank my good close personal friend Greg Nelson up there at

[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.900]
Lou Backroach. She really always takes good care of me. I never even told this story

[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:47.760]
out on a year about my 97 Corvette. Let me just say this to you. Okay. Don't buy a 97

[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.600]
Corvette. That would be the only model of year I would tell you to stay away because

[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:56.260]
that's the year they made the major engine change and lots of body style changes. And

[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:59.700]
people warned me they said the first year, that's always the limit. That's always the

[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.880]
problems. And I told you about some of the other problems I had reduced engine power

[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.840]
and this and that. And then Friday morning I get in the car to come to work here and the

[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:11.300]
lights are ringing and flashing. Here we go again. We do the engine power and I said screw

[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:16.380]
it. I just had the module change. I just had it fixed for the 85th time. I don't need

[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:21.120]
no problems. So I made one easy call Saturday. I go up there to

[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:24.800]
after my appearance had been in Jerry. Fought myself a beautiful new 99

[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:27.640]
puter Corvette, which is sitting right out there by the way, George.

[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:33.200]
That nice. I love that puter. Everybody's got to have a puter. How can you get on

[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.520]
the internet without a goddamn puter? But anyway, Greg Nelson who's been

[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.900]
suddenly cars up there for about a hundred years. This guy lost more weight on the

[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:43.940]
Atkins diet. About 45 50 pounds. I couldn't believe it. I looked at him and said,

[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:48.040]
what's happened to you? You look great. And he thanked me once again. Here's another

[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:52.960]
guy's life that I saved and looks a shadow of his former self on the Atkins

[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:59.920]
guy. I mean, he was a he was blobby. Believe me, he was a big blobby guy. So thanks

[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:03.700]
again, Neil. For saving somebody else's life, too bad you can't do it for yourself. Too

[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:07.300]
bad you just can't get off that goddamn sugar. Too bad you're hooked. You're

[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:11.500]
addicted. Addicted to it. You just can't stop sucking up that damn sugar.

[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.560]
Here's Pompano. Hello.

[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.280]
Hey, how you doing? Okay, sir. Settle down a little today. Big guy to Monday.

[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:23.920]
Meaning what? I can't say if I settle down, then they really go into a coma. Well,

[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.940]
that's what you're there for. Any of the more is the bigger reaction day? How's it

[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:30.960]
looking in the house in the Senate in your opinion? What do you mean? How's it

[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.880]
looking? What would it be twice for public and Democrats? It looks like the

[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.800]
Republicans are going to get the big shift that they thought it looks like the

[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.320]
Democrats are going to lose about maybe three or four more seats in the

[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:46.340]
house. Maybe half a dozen at most and maybe two or three in the Senate. That

[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:49.720]
will help. All right. Thank you. Because even yesterday if you're watching the

[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:53.380]
Sunday talking head shows, even the Republican hot shots are way down there

[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.880]
on the rest of it. It's not that you're really low-balling it. That's what I was

[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.720]
reading, but I still thought they were looking at double digits in your way. You're

[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.480]
taking what about the Nazi up in Tallahassee? What do you think? Which race looking like that?

[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:07.520]
No chance. You don't think he's got the election run? I'm saying buddy McKay. No chance.

[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:11.620]
Go on vote ten times. Go on. Early and often, if you were sent on 60 minutes

[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:15.300]
last night, get your dogs, your cats, your ducks, your geese, get them all

[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:18.040]
together and vote 600 times for buddy McKay because he ain't got a

[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:23.040]
Chinaman's chance. Open line in Broward, two in date, five six seven

[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:27.420]
oh five sixty, pound five sixty on the mobile one line. Mobile in South Miami.

[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:33.840]
Hello? Dale? Yes, sir. We were talking a while back with the

[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.040]
equipment bashing about any kind of political ramifications or these guys step

[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:43.280]
too far. Friday I'm up driving up in Cruel and do and driving on one of these

[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.860]
small partways and who I see in the middle of the meeting holding a little

[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:52.240]
sign is Mr. McCollum, the guy that was bashing. Oh my god. What's over

[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.640]
you around? Mr. Near out in the middle like I'm saying what the heck is this guy

[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.540]
doing? I mean somebody's gonna run him over. He's out there waving his

[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:02.700]
signs to this guy's really worried about a Clinton bashing and I figured you

[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:06.720]
might want a little interest item there rather than talk about sports but I

[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.480]
thought it was pretty funny. Okay. And you know Monica's gonna go

[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:13.500]
Republican right because the Democrats put a bad taste in the mouth. Yeah she

[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.280]
goes both ways. Okay. We have an open line in Broward, two in

[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:19.780]
date, five six seven oh five sixty, pound five sixty on the mobile one line.

[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:25.440]
Five fear anymore jokes about Hanukkah, Lewinsky. Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:30.400]
Hello? Hello, Neil? Yes, sir. How are you, sir? Okay. Listen to you all

[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:34.540]
the time. Love you, show. What to tell you is just everyone to vote a straight

[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:39.240]
Democratic ticket all the way. Yeah. Every single. Okay. Please stay out.

[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:42.140]
Everybody go out and vote for every Democrat on a ballot. Sounds good to me.

[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:47.620]
Oh, all right. Have a good day, buddy. Okay. Sounds great to me. Oh. And if I

[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:50.140]
would have just seen that 60 minutes piece, why didn't they show that a couple of

[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:53.520]
months ago for Christchurch? I'd be registered 200 times already. I'd be registered

[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.080]
50,000 times. I might get that goddamn buddy McCain there if I would have known

[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:01.980]
that few months ago. Now they show it two days before the election. Open line in

[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:06.140]
Broward to any women to let you out right. Tell me another story. Okay. We've got

[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:09.960]
the invisible even Ray Milan was more visible than our female audience. If we

[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:14.340]
got an installation, I'll guarantee you that five six seven oh it's like that

[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:17.540]
thing they stick up the back of your car when you go to the emission inspection

[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:21.280]
station. That probe that they stick in there. That's what we keep doing here every

[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:26.440]
day between ten and two probing out there to see if they get any response. Do we

[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:31.100]
usually? No. No, not really. Here's homestead. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir.

[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:37.380]
Dale. Yeah. I got to talk about Jimmy Johnson. Yeah. Jimmy Johnson makes a bone

[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:43.300]
head call every game at least one. And players are playing hard. I got to

[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:48.040]
answer the players playing hard. Yeah. But they have to overcome his bone head

[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:53.940]
coaching. He's on game day. Every time. Yeah. You think Brock? Brock?

[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:56.980]
Your name was playing hard and that one touched on pass. You got burned real bad

[01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:00.180]
on the game. That was yeah. You were right about that. That was

[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:02.760]
absolutely pathetic. It was like it was like you were. It was like there was nobody

[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.680]
else on the field like the defenders just started that secondary at times. I

[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.600]
mean we could have won that game. We were up by ten points in the fourth quarter.

[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:16.300]
Yeah. Why did he not defend the Inzo? If he could have defended the Inzo instead of going

[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:21.860]
for the play with the interception, whatever he was doing. You know, when you get

[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:24.780]
up by so far, you're saying that Jimmy Johnson makes mistakes. Is that what you're

[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:29.640]
saying, sir? Oh, absolutely. I think you're out of line. Okay. There's a caller

[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:34.480]
who's definitely out of line. Jimmy don't make mistakes. We have two open lines

[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.720]
today. Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty automobile one line. Yeah. I'm

[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:42.720]
looking at the center one numbers from last week. Never in all the years that have

[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.720]
been on the year. Has anything incensed me more than the fact that this outfit

[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:53.720]
is so goddamn cheap. Not one single out one sales person. No, am I am I missing

[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:58.140]
something? Did the sales person come to me with a check that I forgot about? Because

[01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:01.180]
if they did, I mean because I had said that originally I forgot about bluff made

[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:04.320]
the nice donation to the pizza lot that night. But is there anybody else in this

[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:09.020]
building who donated one single set of penny a nickel, a dime, a dollar to the

[01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:17.700]
center one thing? Can you think of anybody? No. The sales manager did she know. I

[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:21.120]
mean, the corporation over there in Naples. No. Those go over there. They come up

[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.700]
with a dime. No. Cosbro casting used to come up with and by the way, even Rhonda

[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:31.480]
Finch and Peter Bulger used to come up with a nice fat check. The one in the year we

[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:35.040]
were attaching over there came in with a big guy. I mean a good check. I think he gave me

[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:39.920]
500 even as much of a douchebag as he is and Rhonda gave me as much or whatever 500

[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:44.420]
thousand, whatever the hell it was because we were doing something. It was something

[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:47.800]
that caused that we believed in. We were involved in and they wanted to be part of

[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.340]
participating in it. Here all they want to do is take the credit for it. They don't want

[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:55.340]
to participate. They just want to take the guy to oh look what we're doing here on QAF.

[01:15:55.560 --> 01:16:02.500]
You're not doing squat. That's what you're doing. Give him a no assistance, baby. None.

[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:08.680]
Zip it. He do to zero. No oral support. No moral support. No nothing. And that's the way

[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:12.400]
there's you had operate. Of course in buggy, just like I've been telling you for 10 months,

[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:16.500]
I'm not making it up. I only wish that it weren't true. I only wish that Norma can't

[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:22.880]
never darken my door. That he never ran into this Greg Greek, Greek guy. It's lunatic.

[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:28.020]
He's an asshole. Man, old man. Who's got stories. There may be these got more stories for

[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:32.900]
you. The checkers in the mail. He's going to get it on the 20th. Yeah, but I beat by the

[01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:36.380]
boat. My wife got sick. But now something that was a terrible story. That was a very sad

[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:40.320]
incident. And that delayed my last bonus check two weeks. But I don't think anybody got

[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:47.140]
sick this last time. What's the story now on his phone is checked? And yes, I am going

[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:50.420]
to be a hard ass. I'm going to stick right to the parameters of what it says in my contract

[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:54.060]
because if you're not a hard ass with these people, as you've seen with a George situation,

[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:58.080]
it just rags on and well, we'll get around to what it checkers in the mail and the

[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.100]
beastlies had a tough month and they can't pay the electric bill and Naples and about

[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:07.000]
a week, but I'll put them up. God damn bunch of millionaires, multi, multi millionaires

[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.280]
and they can't give you whatever it had you got. Come on. Whatever the amount is, whatever

[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:16.200]
they measly, beastly amount is, they can't come up with it when it's supposed to be.

[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:25.360]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Fort Lauderdale. Yeah. Yes, sir. I'm going to call them about

[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:30.900]
Miami Dolphin. What is it? Dr. Dolphin. Who? Miami Dolphin. What about them, sir? Speak.

[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:36.300]
Why? Why do we have to go through so many receivers when it's really the quarterback?

[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:41.640]
Damn, Marino. Yeah. Okay. Damn Marino sucks. Okay. Your comments are well-known,

[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:45.360]
it's even though you're full of crap. We have an open line and day one and

[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.480]
Broward five day lost the bomb. Okay. Even though we got them down to the four-yard line

[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:53.980]
with two seconds clock ran out yesterday at the end of the game. It's all day in these

[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:57.400]
four. Let's find somebody to blame. Let's not blame the coach. Let's blame somebody on the team.

[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:02.860]
Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line. Mobile in

[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:11.860]
Coral Springs. Hello. Mobile in Coral Springs. Okay. Have a nice day. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.900]
Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, how's it going, Neil? Okay. What is it? You're going to get

[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:25.740]
out of your radio station, man? You're on your program. Meaning what? I've been on. I've been

[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:31.700]
on. You're on. Now that you're on. Say something, sir. I know that. You know, the rich

[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:37.120]
care rich. I thought it'll want to give you guys your bonuses. And sidewalks. Yeah. And

[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:41.220]
I think that douche bags and I give you. Okay. Great. Okay. Thank you. Okay. We have an

[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:44.180]
open line. He waited all that time. He's had such a tough time getting on. And what did

[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:48.860]
he say? Did he say anything? No. Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the

[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:55.600]
mobile one line. Another Julio with no life. Here's a mobile in Davie. Hello. Hello. Yes,

[01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:02.300]
sir. Hey, I agree with you. Make a pay at number one. Number two, listen, not the any

[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:07.540]
fault of the players fault. I was interested yesterday when I saw that phone head play with

[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:13.320]
not putting the ball to find out the papers today. Any paper at Jimmy Johnson were

[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:19.760]
no up to the problem as he made a mistake. You know what Mary? Mary said, I made a

[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:25.000]
mistake. I do the coverage. Danny said, hey, it didn't work. We tried to do it. You

[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.380]
know, that comment said we didn't have enough. She's in jail. So we didn't have enough.

[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:32.920]
Jimmy Johnson said he screwed up. No. Now, Jimmy Johnson don't make mistakes. He's a hard

[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.280]
answer with the real crappy attitude who wants to rip into the media and anybody who dares

[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:40.700]
to criticize him. He made a very very serious, unacceptable blunder. And even though the

[01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:44.400]
game, you know, had its ups and downs long after that, nevertheless, that changed the

[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.180]
whole tone of the game. That's the only thing that upset me is that in today's paper,

[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:52.240]
in the interviews, after he didn't say, you know what? I think I've been doing that call.

[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:57.460]
He didn't even say that. He just said, hey, it didn't matter. That call didn't have anything

[01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.200]
to do with the outcome of the game. I thought that was interesting.

[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.740]
Well, that's Jimmy. All right. Don't leave mistakes.

[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:05.360]
Okay. Have a great day, sir. We have an open line in Brown. And of course, like I said,

[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:10.120]
it is a pope who's nothing but a little weasel of wannabe. Starts off pretending he's

[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.900]
going to rip into Jimmy and the worst call he's ever seen and the worst one he's ever

[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:16.100]
made here in Yadiah. And then by the time it gets to the end of his long convoluted

[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:19.600]
column in which he actually says at one point, oh, up here with me, I'm actually going

[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:23.780]
to say something here. And he does, by the time it gets to the end, well, we do understand

[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:28.000]
he was trying to cry out and take the crowd out of the game and start up being an apologist

[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:34.200]
again as usual. We got a bunch of weak sisters writing news in the newspapers in this town.

[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:38.500]
Columnist and most of the people on here, weak sisters who just don't want to tell

[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.460]
it like it is. Then if you do say it like it is, then you're a bad guy. Then you're

[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:46.620]
in the center of a bitch. Everybody had kind of give you that evil look. You son of a

[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:50.140]
bitch. Exactly. Crawf 56 and 5c.

[01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:58.260]
Q. A. L. The Neil Roger Schardel. A but heads. It's a one to two hour. One, two at 560 WQ.

[01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:01.540]
I mean, there are a lot of rumors that the islanders were going to leave, uh, Nassau Long Island

[01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:04.880]
County County, kind of, or Nassau County, Coliseum and move to Jersey and play in the

[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:07.140]
metal lands like the devil's do. But you know why they won't move to Jersey?

[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:16.480]
A lot of food. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. I know. Open line of day 5 670 560

[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:22.260]
pound 560 on the 18 T wireless line. You know, the asshole that was running around with

[01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:27.100]
the laundry on his head. That was a Ken block, by the way. I can tell by the past the

[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:33.100]
arm and the beard Ken block and the beard. They were there on Saturday. Yeah. Now, one

[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:37.120]
single solitary penny from the whole staff here other than our program director. They

[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:41.760]
have a QM for us and a one fundraiser in campaign. This is what you call teamwork, baby.

[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:48.280]
This is what you call a real team effort going on here. Nassia just warms the

[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:53.380]
cockles of your heart if I can say that. Can I say that? No. Sorry. Here's Miami. Hello.

[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.780]
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yes. Let me remind you that also early in the season,

[01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:04.440]
another bone has played a Jimmy Johnson made it was that you went for two and

[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.640]
we already know that she already discussed it. That's why sports talk is boring

[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:11.160]
because people keep repeating the same boring stuff over and over again. I'm very sorry.

[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:15.260]
I watched the game. I'm not. It was a great game, but I'm sorry. I brought it up. Let's

[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:19.540]
please. The other 20 hours of the day to Jimmy Johnson and Adolph and they lost the game

[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:25.780]
and got to do these great, et cetera, and so on. Here's the mobile and curl spring.

[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:31.000]
So, okay, he's gone because he did that. I don't want to hear anymore about it. If I

[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.920]
have to sit here and talk to myself all our I'd rather do that than you just repeat

[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:38.640]
the same thing over and over again. There's nothing more than needs to be said, okay?

[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.840]
Look at that. Just every head, every line on here lit up because they all want to say,

[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:46.980]
forget about it. Tangle beyond it too. Okay. I don't want to talk anymore. God damn

[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:51.340]
sports. That's why it's ponderous and boring because you got the same. Oh, and how about

[01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:56.380]
if how about if it was your don't leave with just throw pancake block? At that point

[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:59.440]
when I heard that, I should have said to myself, it's time to go on that ship of Colonel

[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:06.160]
Glenn, a pancake block. Two open lines in Dave County, five, six, seven,

[01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:11.480]
line, mobile in tempered fines. Hello. Hi, Neil. How you doing? Okay, sir. I'd like to

[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:15.460]
tell you a little story about the not-declined tempered fines. Yeah. They get an

[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:21.520]
intersection on fines, boulevard and 136 Avenue out in front of the automation there and

[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:25.880]
they're constantly sitting up a ticket trap there and they finally have to live

[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:30.140]
in out there five years. They finally got me to run in the red light. And I

[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:35.440]
found out when I went to court that the Department of Transportation state laws that

[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.640]
for every 10 miles of posted speed that a yellow light must stay yellow for one

[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:46.480]
second. The mileage out there is 50 miles an hour so the yellow light must stay

[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:50.900]
yellow for five seconds, which I found is out when I went to court, which I didn't

[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:54.960]
know until the cop brought it up. So I told the judge that there's no way that

[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:59.400]
that light stays yellow for five seconds. This is all right. I'll give you 30 days

[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.960]
to get a letter from the Department of Transportation posting what and how

[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:07.440]
long that light stays yellow. So I went to court a couple days ago, as well as

[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:10.240]
this is interesting. I didn't even know about this because I went to trial and

[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:13.960]
that's because there's no way that light is yellow so short. Now I went out

[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:18.320]
and I timed it and I liked stays yellow for only three seconds. So that's why these

[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:22.620]
cops did out there. We day in and day out. Yeah. And that's why they got the red

[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:27.260]
light because the patient of rural service called easy pickings. Yeah. So now I

[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:30.680]
got to get a letter from Department of Transportation saying that this light

[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:34.640]
is only three seconds and I videotaped it and everything. So now I go back to

[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:38.220]
court and show this judge know one of this is a ticket trap and they just

[01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:41.800]
bust people time and time and time and time. Everybody run in that red light. Yeah.

[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:45.520]
When it's only three seconds and they know it. Anybody out the emperors pines

[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:49.200]
and buses that intersection and there's thousands of them. You can just go

[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:52.960]
back there and say, hey, look, this yellow light is only light is yellow for three

[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:56.360]
seconds. Not five seconds like it's supposed to. And there are the ones that are

[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:00.620]
breaking while we put the DOT people in jail. Exactly. Okay. Well, don't do that again.

[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:05.300]
Here's Miami Lake. Hello. Hey, Neil. How are you? Okay, sir. I didn't

[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:08.160]
clear to talk about sports because obviously this whole town doesn't know

[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:12.280]
what the hell they're talking about. And it's not really a sports town to be

[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:16.040]
honest with you. Practically the only one who knows sports in this town. I'm a

[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:20.560]
Buffalo Bill's fan and the only thing I analysis from from this Miami fan is

[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.960]
regardless of Jimmy's made the decision of taking it or going for it.

[01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:29.720]
Regardless of whatever happened, these people wouldn't be happy. I mean, you

[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:33.420]
had to make the first sound. That's how you make these people happy. I mean, it's

[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:37.300]
stupid. It's just that's why he just paid the big bucks. These people don't know

[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:41.740]
what the hell they're talking about. They're the worst. What's time I ever

[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:44.600]
seen in the whole United States? I don't understand. What do you mean you had to

[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.460]
make the first sound? What does that mean? Well, it was the ball was what three and

[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:53.400]
one inch, a third and one two. No, it was more than one. More than one on their own

[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:57.200]
36 yard line. Okay. Don't go for that. All right. You don't go for a one

[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:01.580]
36. You have to be out of why not? You're claiming to be a football fan and you

[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:04.980]
ask me. I'm not a football fan. I'm not a football fan. You first you started

[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:07.600]
to call by saying you were going to talk about football and all you've talked

[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:11.660]
about is football. And you don't need and you're not going to Miami fans. You

[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:14.700]
don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, he's a Buffalo fan because they want

[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:17.740]
to gain me today. So I hear anybody. He probably got his goals. You're as he

[01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:20.780]
on already because they want to gain me today. That's going there, sir. You

[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:25.740]
didn't like a goddamn rubber glove right in the old post. That's right. No clue

[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:29.320]
what they're talking about. Dave County, all three lines open five six seven

them feel better. Where do you go when you're feeling like?

[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:50.280]

[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:17.100]
No. Five six seven oh five six. Here's a camera. Hello. Hey, what's up, Pop? How

[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:40.980]

[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:54.920]
they can get one of those little China piggy bank. Everybody. Everybody

[01:27:54.920 --> 01:28:01.320]
got a couple cents in there. Man, oh man. These people refuse. They don't care

[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:04.360]
and there's nothing you can do to make them care. They don't want to be

[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:08.880]
involved. They don't want to know from it and that's great. All of our

[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:11.760]
county all three lines open. You know, their lines were smoking when you were

[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:14.200]

Carroll City. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I was just watching the CNN that

[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:49.960]
Gordon approved. Yeah. And they had, um, they were talking about a per fell

[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:53.860]
given a million dollars from college owns. Yeah. I didn't know what what

[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:57.140]
is he trying to do? Have it. Don't you watch the news? How did you see this?

[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:00.580]
Where is it? Where is it? How did he benefit from this? Because he's a

[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:03.420]
university-sicking asshole. That's all. He's in the

[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:06.460]
Amazon and always has been. And then he starts to end up.

[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:09.780]
Yeah, but we're sure. And Robert Westwood is bringing up that point world. You

[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:13.660]
know, I hope that's a big thank you. What is this? You were saying, how can

[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:17.040]
we or not end up getting kind of star? You mean, you got the proof with

[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:20.220]
illegal? Yeah. And he was defending that. But everybody's there. Oh, no, no, no,

[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:25.260]
whatever he found, he found. Yeah. You got to hope in those jobs. He looks a lot better.

[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:30.300]
That's your fault. Bitch. State County's open now. This guy just discovered it.

[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:34.960]
I'm CNN last night. Why is that a busy full-life like everybody this time? Here's a mobile

[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:37.560]
import. Hello. Okay, sir.

[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:42.740]
Excuse me, baby. Have a quick thing. You know, I'm a man. I want to talk to you

[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:44.820]
saying about the law. You know, if we were let judge.

[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:47.760]
So I heard people out, cut the bullcrap. You read all those laws and start

[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:50.480]
to even with the cocaine, the heroin people. Those are the people that are like

[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:53.120]
Robin, you're seven lovers and kill them people and they're all trying to

[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:58.060]
crazy stuff. Okay, no sympathy for me on cocaine. Cracked cocaine, regular

[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:01.700]
plain old cocaine, any kind of cocaine. No sympathy in this corner. Sorry, pal.

[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:05.960]
Face the call, by the way, George. Here's a mobile import. Lauderdale. Hello.

[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:11.000]
Hello, Dale. Yes, sir. Just one question. How are you been?

[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:16.660]
What does that mean? No, what I want to know. What does that mean with the

[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:20.680]
phony voice? What does that mean? No, phony voice. Exactly. Do you know anything about

[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:23.920]
Jack Lee and Jack Lee? It's all it's all it's all it's all it's.

[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:27.060]
But not anything to this. Does anybody here know who Jackie Lee is beside you with me?

[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:31.800]
Well, slightly no. Okay, thank you. How are you talking about it? Here's another guy.

[01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:34.900]
We had to hook him up with the guys who called to go. That found out about

[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:37.760]
Abe Herschel to the million dollars to follow John. Old,

[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.420]
stale, news, sir. Just like Jackie Lee, old and stale.

[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:46.420]
Oh, open line is powered to into a bad poor Jackie Lee to freehold.

[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.020]
And you know why Jackie Lee hangs out in freehold?

[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.960]
A lot of footwear is there. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[01:30:54.600 --> 01:31:00.100]
I got a mobile in my mouth. Hello. Yes, sir. You know what's the phone?

[01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:03.880]
You know what there's anything still going for it? What is this?

[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:07.780]
There's no basketball on it. I think you need to have a good.

[01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:10.420]
Yeah, okay, right. Go get your own balls. Okay, pal.

[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.420]
Maybe you can find some on a street corner. Some American buy some.

[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:17.120]
There's a guy looking for balls. Two over lines a day to him.

[01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:21.160]
They don't do sports on it. I'm important to some police officers like

[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:25.540]
a Metro date and all over safety department on this proposition 12.

[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:29.960]
And some of these fellows are scared to speak out to lose in their jobs.

[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:34.100]
Yes. So I'd like to at least point bring across some of their points.

[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:39.200]
Back in the olden days, you drove your car. You'd be legal in one county with a gun.

[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:42.420]
Elegal in another county. And you were arrested. You could be thrown in

[01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:46.500]
prison and not even know you were illegal by unscrupulous prosecutors.

[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:49.720]
Yeah. And they also said that the E is criminal

[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:52.800]
sale of guns that gun shows is so small.

[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:58.220]
In the ocean compared to the illegal gun sales elsewhere and around the country.

[01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:01.460]
Yeah. So they feel that this proposition is just

[01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:04.860]
does more harm than does good to the honest citizen.

[01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:08.160]
So in other words, you ought to be able to walk into a gun show and buy a six or seven guns

[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:10.060]
without any criminal check and just walk out the door.

[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:11.600]
Want the ammo? Is that what you're saying, sir?

[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:15.860]
No, but we're saying that what I was trying to close down everything.

[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:18.100]
They're trying to. Good. They're trying to.

[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.400]
Good. But that's good.

[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.360]
Put your own hands in an gun that's all in jail.

[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:21.800]
That's right.

[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:28.100]
That's what Linda Blair says.

[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:29.200]
They county lines are open.

[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.860]
Our show without one real lady calling here today. Is that possible?

[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:32.300]
Uh-huh.

[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.280]
Well, an entire four hour show.

[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:38.580]
That is the, oh no, we had that old woman I called before.

[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.260]
I'm so remember. Oh, thank God I remember that.

[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:41.040]
Well, she don't count.

[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:44.020]
She's older than a fuzzless grandma that old back.

[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:45.940]
Now she was nice. She just the old and she was born.

[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:50.700]
5670560, Palm 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:52.220]
Here's Hollywood. Hello.

[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.540]
Yeah. Did you see the teenager?

[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:58.320]
We sent this court to three or four years from position where I want to.

[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:00.000]
You're so despondent.

[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:01.680]
I ran into story on here here Friday.

[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:02.760]
Jumped out of it was in Manhattan.

[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:04.560]
He jumped out of the window and killed himself.

[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:05.880]
It was amazing. We were going.

[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:06.560]
Yeah.

[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:07.180]
marijuana.

[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:08.600]
There's by hardened criminal.

[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:10.680]
But what was it just feel about that?

[01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:11.440]
He doesn't care.

[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:14.120]
I think the judge had a woman commit suicide is what I think.

[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:14.800]
That's a good idea.

[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:15.980]
Okay. Thank you.

[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:17.360]
All to get on the subway with Bernard.

[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.160]
Get another one for you.

[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.920]
Open line and BNT wireless line.

[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:23.800]
We keep probing just like John Glenn.

[01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:25.460]
Reckon keep sticking our probe and.

[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:26.740]
Reckon and nothing's happening.

[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.440]
Okay. You know what I said old farties up there in space.

[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:30.300]
Still hasn't had a good.

[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:31.240]
I like that.

[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:32.640]
That's why he went up there.

[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:34.000]
He's been plugged up for about 20 years.

[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:36.340]
John Glenn thought that because you know,

[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.520]
all that the free weight and free.

[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:41.820]
Still hasn't had to be a muffin.

[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:43.880]
I've got to him ship and that's what they're all laughing about.

[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:45.380]
You know, it should be kind of sure that I asked the people

[01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:46.540]
out of your life and their ass off.

[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:47.840]
Hey John, have one today yet?

[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:48.400]
Good to be empty.

[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:48.560]
No.

[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:49.280]
Not yet.

[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:54.820]
Here's maybe a few more of those goddamn flutty flakers.

[01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:56.340]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:33:56.340 --> 01:33:56.660]
Hello.

[01:33:57.700 --> 01:33:58.060]
Hello.

[01:33:58.320 --> 01:33:58.660]
Yes sir.

[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:00.500]
You've got a great show.

[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:01.380]
I like it a lot.

[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:02.940]
I just want to make a point.

[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:03.420]
Yeah.

[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.780]
The Democrats are going to make hard in just elections

[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:09.540]
because of their way to Republicans when about this.

[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:10.780]
Monica G.

[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:11.760]
Right.

[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:15.080]
So Democrats are going to make it in just a lecture

[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:16.380]
all across the country.

[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:16.740]
Okay.

[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:17.540]
I hope you're right sir.

[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:19.300]
From your mouth to God's ears.

[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:20.880]
I'd like to show a lot.

[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:21.720]
And God bless you.

[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:22.680]
I'd hear you go.

[01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:23.020]
He said,

[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:23.980]
Oh god.

[01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:25.920]
We're going to make sure all the Democrats get into Marl.

[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:28.400]
That's what he said because we're sick and tired of these goddamn

[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.080]
mahypocrates.

[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:30.140]
These sanctimonious

[01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:31.980]
full-crap Republicans like New King,

[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:33.360]
which in all these other Dan Burton.

[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:35.260]
Henry High, he's high,

[01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:37.860]
the broke up that poor guy's marriage over there in Western.

[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:41.260]
Open line and broad too up over the weekend by the way.

[01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:44.200]
Yesterday being Sunday all those good righteous Christians.

[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:45.180]
How many million?

[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:47.100]
I forget how many million they give an up on the news life.

[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:49.520]
Millions and millions of those little sheets they had

[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.480]
at all those churches all over America.

[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:54.560]
Those good right wing born again, hypocritical assholes.

[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.740]
Those bigoted douchebagged, those scumbags

[01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:58.600]
that want to take over the whole goddamn government.

[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:01.440]
Do you think they endorsed one single Democrat?

[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:01.780]
No.

[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:02.600]
I don't think so.

[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:05.200]
Because now all of a sudden,

[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:05.960]
evangelical,

[01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:08.340]
fanatical Christian and Republican,

[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:09.220]
it becomes synonymous.

[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:11.100]
Here you go, same people, same assholes.

[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:14.940]
We want to run everybody's goddamn life.

[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.620]
We want to take effect of the Stone Age

[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:18.320]
with their goddamn bull-crap Bible

[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:19.440]
until everybody had to live.

[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:22.420]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6.

[01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:23.200]
Number 5, hello.

[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:24.500]
Hello, Neil.

[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:24.940]
Yes?

[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:26.800]
Hey, I got it out.

[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.980]
Okay, get a new phone and call me up into, let me hear it.

[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:32.000]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:33.780]
pound 5, 60 out of 18 T line.

[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:35.060]
Here's Cooper City.

[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:35.320]
Hello.

[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:36.600]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:36.940]
Okay.

[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:40.200]
I just read on the Libertarian West Side

[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:41.360]
that, uh,

[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:41.940]
Wait a minute.

[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.720]
Well, I don't agree with that.

[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:43.960]
Yeah.

[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:47.060]
The GOP tried to pass the law last year.

[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.500]
That it's a second time offender

[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:52.100]
who's found with two ounces of marijuana or more.

[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:53.160]
Electric here.

[01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:54.260]
Death penalty.

[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:54.660]
Uh-huh.

[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:55.400]
Did you know that?

[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:55.780]
No.

[01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:56.660]
Unbelievable.

[01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.060]
And I don't believe it.

[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:00.560]
It's on there is anybody else.

[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:02.020]
Well, the Libertarians put it on there.

[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:03.400]
They all need this smoking too much

[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.400]
bad with Libertarian.

[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:06.400]
So that's like the guy that was

[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:07.760]
a huck of the China with that asshole

[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.140]
from a school magazine,

[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:10.320]
which I forgot the name already.

[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:10.880]
And I threw it away.

[01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:11.720]
Please don't say it.

[01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:14.160]
I know the great philosopher

[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:16.720]
with his satanic or anti-religion

[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:17.140]
whatever you want.

[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:18.160]
And don't say it.

[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:19.820]
Uh-huh.

[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.240]
Same thing.

[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:23.520]
Oh, well, I'm with the Libertarians.

[01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:23.780]
Great.

[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:24.020]
You might.

[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:25.760]
And guess what they put on there again.

[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.240]
I put it on another repeat last night.

[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:28.020]
They must have had a flood.

[01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:29.180]
I'm doing my channel surfing.

[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:30.480]
Here's a little rock here.

[01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:31.380]
Oh, on there again.

[01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:32.320]
But there it came.

[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:33.800]
Oh, my God.

[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:34.480]
Yeah.

[01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:37.880]
Same old bull crap.

[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:39.300]
He's in fact, he's got a written down.

[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:40.800]
He's reading his own little prepared speech.

[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:42.440]
Is he running for dog catcher this year

[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.280]
for anything else?

[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:43.420]
No.

[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.640]
So what's all they keep sticking his stupid ass on there for?

[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:47.960]
But his big ears look like dumber one bad day.

[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.600]
They should have sent him to that plastic surgeon down there

[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:52.440]
in Rio that was on 60 minutes last night.

[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.800]
You see that little kid with a big ear?

[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:54.980]

[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:55.420]
Huh?

[01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:57.480]
And when his surgeon got done,

[01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:58.760]
when he looked at the mirror and he was smiling,

[01:36:59.020 --> 01:36:59.740]
still looked so goofy.

[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:00.360]
But, uh-huh.

[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:02.920]
We have a-

[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.320]
Did he still look so bizarre?

[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:05.040]
Not as good.

[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.240]
In fact, it looked like instead of just flying like dumber,

[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.240]
he was going to take off straight up into the air with those ears.

[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:11.780]
But he's also 25 past one at night.

[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:11.960]
No.

[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:13.920]
Anybody going to vote four or five hundred times tomorrow?

[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:14.200]
No.

[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:15.160]
Damn it.

[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.540]
That's what we got to do to get over buddy.

[01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:18.500]
And he's my buddy.

[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:19.920]
He's an old Yahoo.

[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.060]
He's like, uh, and Andy Griffith is doing the spot

[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:25.000]
for Democratic candidate because he's a 300.

[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.220]
All right, Andy.

[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:28.080]
Oh, he's like those awful shows he was on.

[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.820]
Have you tried the new his new

[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:32.280]
and haven't?

[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:35.620]
You had a life off either.

[01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:57.500]
I've only-

[01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:57.700]
Leben.

[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:27.600]
I'm gonna die you, I'm gonna die you, I'm gonna die you, I'm gonna die you, I'm gonna die you

[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:32.060]
I rolled that boot sick wheel and down, making that with my leg on, M-I-L-I-M-I-S

[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:34.320]
I couldn't have pissed a fat of B-B-O

[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:39.000]
Feeling pitch outta got my back most poked, I'm a whole bunch of nearly choked

[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.720]
When she sucked down my big fat wheel and started to scream like a horny ill-billy

[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:48.220]
Hillary's mad, I'm down on my knees, it's Taylor West's kid, Dr. Reese

[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:57.880]
I'm so wanna be my fellow Steve, I'm so gonna be Steve, I'm so gonna be Steve, I'm so gonna be Steve, I'm so gonna be Steve, I'm so gonna be Steve, I'm so gonna be Steve

[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:01.900]
Superstar report, I really can't cope, I'm the president, not the friggin' first

[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:06.260]
The time is now when I'm calling and clean, I like my boobs with cherry cream

[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:11.280]
The boys on the hill, they they may you be, or if I'm gettin' so far to truth and delete

[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:16.000]
Time to hire a cash cream could be legit, if she didn't spin they must be quick

[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.140]
We're not from his over in time, just boom

[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:20.140]
I'm jumping in the middle of the lead like a hot potato

[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:22.800]
Never stop a Hillary, they're all I do

[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:25.220]
He's all getting busy with January now

[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:27.480]
Sick of that, I never want to hold me a bump

[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.920]
I might have got struck by the shit not come

[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:32.040]
Shares the death, motherfucking shit is not a death

[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.840]
Excuse me, general bum, Afghanistan

[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:35.220]
Woo!

[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:39.080]
Sticking the cigar with chance to stand

[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:41.460]
You picked that big box, you're black, man and wet

[01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:43.560]
We're supposed to pull that same dress

[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.960]
Clean it, be out, do it so many times

[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:48.540]
I got a little secret, I'm ready to end it

[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:50.660]
Saw kidn't thought you would lend a trick

[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:52.940]
Checking out the booties, I'm ready to pop

[01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:55.640]
Or would everybody unlet in my pants

[01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:57.480]
Ewww, you're off!

[01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:01.820]
132 and 560 W2M, we got to hangover coming up from

[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:02.800]
Shuler State 2 with 2

[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:04.700]
Luke Shamby, 6 o'clock tonight, briefly

[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:06.820]
Because then we got the big panther game

[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:07.600]
No, yes we do

[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:10.280]
Seven o'clock tonight, to pre-gaming then 730

[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:12.080]
Panthers at the islanders on the pond

[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.860]
There in Long Island, will there be anybody there?

[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:14.160]
No

[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:14.940]
Will there be anybody listening?

[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:15.200]
No

[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.020]
It's gonna be big

[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:19.140]
Maybe tonight we'll find out what we really got out there

[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:21.020]
Maybe Terry Murray got a lobotomy over the weekend

[01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:22.820]
We have an open line in Broward to

[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:24.720]
Competo B, chill out

[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:27.140]
Competo B

[01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:28.340]
Yeah, hi, Gail

[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:28.800]
Yes sir

[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:30.980]
Yeah, my name is Frank, I'm a transport in New York

[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:31.980]
I'm down here in South Florida

[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:34.760]
I just like to tell you, I think you're not only very entertaining

[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:36.080]
But you're going in as informative

[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:39.180]
For someone who doesn't protect the sports journalists

[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:40.940]
You know more than anybody down here

[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:41.580]
That's a short

[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:42.180]
Yes I do

[01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:43.440]
My question is

[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.920]
We're talking about sports is very boring

[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:46.520]
So especially down here at Spondwreth

[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:48.180]
And they do it 20 hours the rest of the day

[01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:49.200]
And I will not do it here

[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:50.740]
Well that's not what I'm calling about

[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:51.100]
Thank God

[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:52.720]
My question to you is

[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:55.600]
If you were to have your choice as to be

[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:56.940]
Who would be our next president?

[01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:58.500]
I'm just curious who you think it should be

[01:40:59.160 --> 01:40:59.880]
Meaning what?

[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:01.640]
Who should be our next president?

[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:02.160]
I mean

[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.980]
I have no idea, I don't know what the person's name is

[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:06.640]
Because I don't see anybody on a horizon

[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:07.840]
Who's qualified to be president

[01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:09.260]
Okay, I'm sorry

[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:11.820]
I don't have much faith in anybody on a horizon either

[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:14.200]
And just want to look at what was a pleasure speaking with you

[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:15.120]
And I would go about it

[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:16.060]
And I wish I could say the same

[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:17.840]
Okay, we have two open lines a day to end

[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.520]
Anybody got an idea for the next president?

[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:19.800]
No

[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:20.880]
How about Dave Hirschfeld?

[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:21.200]
No

[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.220]
What's wrong with that?

[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:25.020]
He gives us the money, he's writing checks

[01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:25.980]
Go over the place

[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:28.320]
Yeah, that's right, he's a classy guy

[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:29.760]
Remember that night that Hank had him on here?

[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:30.800]
That was pretty nice

[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:33.080]
He wanted all of the counter that night

[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:33.800]
That was fresh

[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:34.020]
Yeah

[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:35.780]
Here's Evan Shura, hello

[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:37.840]
Neil God

[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:38.420]
Yes sir

[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:41.500]
I'm just letting you know I'm out in front of borders in Evan Shura

[01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:41.860]
Yeah

[01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:43.480]
But both CD's

[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:44.520]
Thank you, God bless you

[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.080]
And just wanted to call

[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:48.820]
One thing I've always wanted to bring to your attention

[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:52.820]
You never notice how on the TV commercials for children international

[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:56.400]
That overwhelming majority of those countries that need

[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.280]
With so much poverty are Catholic

[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:01.220]
Well of course they're Catholic because they're reproducing like rabbits

[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:02.900]
That's the way the Pope wants it

[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:06.540]
But you think if they were Catholics that there'd be some help?

[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:07.680]
No

[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:09.460]
Have a nice day

[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:10.960]
Thank you so much, thanks for your help

[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:14.160]
Well there's a great amount of just donated forty bucks to center one

[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:17.000]
picked up the CD that's more than our entire sales department put together

[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:17.520]
Is it not?

[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:19.820]
And our management and sales department put together

[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:20.260]
Right?

[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.640]
And everybody else on the staff except for everybody who put together

[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:24.120]
Right?

[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:24.980]
And you know something?

[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:25.820]
I don't want it

[01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:29.940]
If they were to come to me right now just like Wayne said

[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:31.600]
If they were to come to me right now

[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:33.000]
And all for me to check

[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.420]
From the management or the sales department

[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:36.980]
I will not take that check for center one or for anybody else

[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:38.220]
I'll take my bonus check

[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:41.280]
So sure thing we'll do it without them

[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:44.720]
Because basically we've done this whole thing without very much assistance from this station anyway

[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:45.960]
So we'll just do it without them

[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:47.440]
I don't want their guide there mine

[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:49.620]
Because if you've got to embarrass somebody and do it again

[01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:51.220]
That's just not, I don't believe in that

[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:53.720]
I mean I've been mentioning it as we go along

[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:56.720]
Because I assume that you know eventually somebody get around with

[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:57.980]
It just doesn't happen

[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:00.600]
It just doesn't happen

[01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:03.700]
And there are people who travel back and forth

[01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:05.020]
Between the two buildings every day

[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:06.960]
So it's not like if somebody over there wanted a way to check

[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:08.300]
It wouldn't get back to us here

[01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:08.800]
Is it?

[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:09.880]
No, I don't think so

[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:11.000]
It's so fine

[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.000]
No interest, I don't want it

[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.040]
We'll get the money from the police

[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:20.800]
We'll listen on the internet all over wherever they are and whatever we do

[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:21.880]
The best you can

[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:25.880]
Because it's obvious now that we work for a radio station

[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:27.500]
It just doesn't care

[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:28.780]
They just don't give a crap

[01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:30.580]
Or you told me that a long time ago

[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:32.220]
But I find it very hard to believe

[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:35.360]
They only want to use people to make them money

[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:39.240]
And it's over because that anybody ever hear this station do insurance stuff before

[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:39.620]
No

[01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:42.880]
And if anybody else involved on this station would do like a fundraiser for a...

[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:43.040]
No

[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:46.760]
This is a goddamn sports station

[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:48.420]
We don't worry about stuff like that

[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:51.120]
I'll raise the money for charities and good causes

[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.880]
Or does he talk and repeat in the same crap over and over and over

[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:56.120]
We're getting 50 million times about the pancake block

[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:57.920]
And a pancake make up and 10 blocks

[01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:59.660]
And every other goddamn bunch of bull crap

[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:03.560]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello

[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:05.480]
Yeah, yes sir

[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:08.580]
Dad, so now some give a crap about football number one

[01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:08.840]
Good

[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:09.760]
You got to double-aid, boy

[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:12.160]
I just came back 17 days in Europe

[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:12.660]
Yeah

[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.980]
I took your advice and I took city first

[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:17.100]
I flew the...

[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:20.580]
And my wife, she's a real reserve kind of loathe person

[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:23.400]
She looked at me and she goes, what are we doing here?

[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:24.940]
There you go

[01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:26.640]
And I always ask myself

[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:29.680]
I mean, it is unfrike and bullied

[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.320]
I'm gonna have to check out that city bird

[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:32.820]
I keep hearing about a good things about them

[01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:33.840]
I'm telling you

[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:34.240]
You will...

[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:36.340]
This guy just had a great time that he came back here

[01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:37.980]
Which, uh, he wonders why

[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:40.100]
Open line and Broward to and date

[01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:43.740]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 22 till 500 and date open again now

[01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:46.260]
Boy, this is brutal, this is really a sad

[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:50.700]
And of course I know that they're not gonna have anything to say about that bonus check today

[01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:52.420]
So that means you'll get George tomorrow

[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.240]
Then Thursday's my birthday and after that I'm going on vacation

[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:56.660]
So all I can say is

[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:57.320]
Oh right

[01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:59.660]
Now I got something to look forward to what he getting depressed about

[01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:02.920]
I was feeling really up there the first 45 minutes this morning

[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:04.900]
And of course all of a sudden the phones hit me in the face

[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:07.380]
That's how you need it

[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:09.220]
I have an estimate that's scoring it down

[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:12.700]
But I'm gonna tell you there are a lot of boring games out there already this season

[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:13.520]
It seems very young

[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:15.800]
And there have been a lot of coma-inducing games

[01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:19.660]
But still, let me tell you something

[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:22.240]
When you got teams playing in Green's Blur

[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:26.340]
In front of 1500 people and in Tampa in front of 5000 people

[01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:28.420]
And New Jersey in front of 6,000

[01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:30.520]
When you got all this expansion going on

[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:32.340]
And you still got more teams coming in

[01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:34.900]
Columbus and Atlanta and Minneapolis which have already failed

[01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:36.480]
That's what's gonna happen

[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:40.020]
This is what expansion does for sports it won't eroons it

[01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:42.760]
I mean I appreciate good defense for sports

[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:45.520]
But there's difference between good defense and in-apps often

[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:45.820]
Right

[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:47.420]
You had a job

[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:48.980]
But you get a chance to watch them

[01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:52.280]
We have an open-line in drought all three in day five together today

[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:53.260]
Happy birthday dear

[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:55.600]
Something somebody that cares, somebody who's alive

[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:58.520]
Somebody out there that's got the cajones that's got the breath

[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.260]
To go to the phone and pick it up

[01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:02.180]
And do any such person out there?

[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:02.500]
No

[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:07.480]
5,670, 560, 0560 on the 18th P. wireless line

[01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:10.380]
Pepper pine, hello

[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:12.060]
Are you all lady?

[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:13.200]
No, not really, yeah

[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:13.960]
Not yet

[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:15.140]
We don't have that problem

[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:17.100]
We don't have to worry about having good goal-tending, huh

[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:18.420]
No, we don't

[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.460]
Listen, I am part of an organization

[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:27.840]
And what I don't like is lines of the companies people in the upper groups of an organization that never contact you

[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:32.500]
Besides the sending the letter, I'm talking about the Florida Association of Realty

[01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:36.340]
If they decide to tell us who we're supposed to vote for

[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:39.460]
And they think that, well, we recommend

[01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:40.180]
Uh-huh

[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:42.660]
That's not the faster jet bush

[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:44.160]
It's not one you recommend to say

[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:45.340]
We're not supposed to

[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:48.460]
Basically, I packed them back a pen page back

[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:51.420]
And I kept re-faxing it through using a bolder paper

[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:54.320]
That's like how you say, you know, you've never been a dog type

[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:56.880]
But he does a lot about the shady real estate deal

[01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:58.420]
So that kind of fits right in, doesn't it?

[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:01.560]
But I just say, I mean, I'm just saying it as a group

[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:04.720]
They wasted all this money on our postage paper

[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:05.160]
Yeah

[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:09.600]
And it's just like, and a lot of people just sit down and take it

[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:10.640]
I mean, who the hell is this guy?

[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:13.300]
You see a lot on postage, you know what you're talking about

[01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:15.260]
Could everybody in Florida is in a real estate business?

[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:17.140]
Everybody in this state is a realtor, it's up to me

[01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:20.060]
He said, that's what they say, check your drivers' license and your real estate

[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:20.760]
Right, that's right

[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:21.700]
Okay, good luck now

[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:22.340]
Hey, before you go

[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:23.240]
Come over to stick it, yes?

[01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:24.560]
Jimmy Johnson, blow

[01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:25.880]
Okay, thank you

[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:29.500]
Okay, we have an open line in Broward to a date, 5, 6, 7, 05

[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:31.980]
Tom 5, 6, 3, on the 18th P.Y. West Line

[01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:34.400]
I'm not going to talk about it anymore, but I just want to say this

[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:36.980]
If I hear one person on this radio station

[01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:38.720]
Or anywhere out there in the general public

[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:41.280]
Trying to defend saying it was a gutsy call

[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:44.600]
By Jimmy to go forth in an inch on your own 36-yard line

[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:46.440]
Early in the game when you got all the momentum going

[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:48.540]
I'm going to call up myself

[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:51.320]
And arrange for a lobotomy for that person

[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:54.280]
A lobotomy, you know how you do a lobotomy?

[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:56.340]
Change it right out immediately, no problem

[01:47:58.140 --> 01:47:59.200]
Here's sunrise, hello

[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:01.180]
I think it was a gusty call

[01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:03.280]
What you're talking about is something just...

[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.100]
Here's a mobile invoker, hello

[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:06.880]
Neil

[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.980]
Yes sir, what was your happy birthday number one?

[01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:09.620]
Thank you

[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:12.040]
The fans that keep talking about the same thing

[01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:15.160]
And you keep playing the same stuff, sunlight

[01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:16.820]
Meaning what?

[01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:19.460]
You know, you know, your material

[01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:21.000]
You need to know what to do with that

[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.780]
Oh yeah, we need to disguise every day now

[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:25.400]
We need no material, that's what he's monitoring again today

[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:26.660]
We got no material every day

[01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:28.380]
Book a Brian just playing 400 new bits

[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:30.380]
Just to keep you entertained, okay sir?

[01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:31.920]
So then you continue your monitoring

[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:34.140]
You jackass, you idiot

[01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:35.520]
Go back to New York, okay?

[01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:36.520]
Like I said, burning gets

[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:37.840]
We've got a spare for you

[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:38.940]
And him and Charlton has been...

[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:39.740]
Let me show the subway

[01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:42.340]
Open line of day one and brown

[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:44.540]
Here's a lady in Miami maybe

[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:45.940]
Hello Neil

[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:46.340]
Yes

[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:47.660]
Happy birthday

[01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:48.700]
Thank you

[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:51.340]
I listen to you all the time

[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:51.680]
Yeah

[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:55.780]
And to me, you're very, very funny

[01:48:55.780 --> 01:48:56.540]
Yeah

[01:48:56.540 --> 01:48:57.660]
You're very...

[01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:00.120]
And I've always liked you show

[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:00.640]
Yeah

[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:02.800]
And I forgot about your birthday

[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:04.960]
Usually I remember your Scorpio

[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:05.640]
Uh-huh

[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:07.980]
So happy, happy birthday

[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:09.100]
Thank you so much

[01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:10.520]
And have a great day

[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:11.140]
Thank you

[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:11.680]
Bye-bye

[01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:13.640]
Okay, we have two...

[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:16.540]
12 minutes before 2 at 5'60

[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:18.120]
Maybe you know what his play-toler was don't you?

[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:18.520]
Rectum

[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:20.020]
It became a shot

[01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:22.220]
And I was a bush that knew it's misery

[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:25.060]
Where'd you find Hank Goldberg?

[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:27.800]
By swear you got it

[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:29.740]
Sports radio 5'60

[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:31.040]
You A.L

[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:32.580]
You're trying to tell you something right now

[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:33.600]
And you can mark it down

[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.680]
If Robert County would change their mind

[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:37.260]
And decide they wanted to build this facility

[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:38.820]
I will not let you

[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:39.280]
Oh right

[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:41.560]
Because I will not have you guys

[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:43.620]
Looking at me for the next 10 years

[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:45.240]
And here's the guy that said one thing

[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:47.600]
And went out and did something else

[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:50.920]
Oh

[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:51.600]
He's a talent

[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:53.480]
Oh

[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:55.960]
He got the money from his daddy

[01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:59.240]
And as I said, my little daddy

[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:00.300]
Oh

[01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:02.300]
We're in the center that's right there

[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:03.560]
Oh

[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.700]
Well he's a talent happy daddy

[01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:07.580]
No, but they're ballet

[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:08.420]
Oh

[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:12.020]
Well he's a presidential son

[01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:13.500]
Who doesn't have to run

[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:15.240]
No one else is gonna know any

[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:17.060]
I just want to just move right in

[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:17.780]
Sing hard

[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:19.560]
Sing hard

[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:21.160]
Sing hard

[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:22.860]
Sing hard

[01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:24.840]
He has a golden spoon

[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:26.740]
He was born with up his ass

[01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:28.300]
So look out all you dudes

[01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:28.560]
Oh

[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:29.740]
Get ready for the gas

[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:30.080]
Oh

[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:30.900]
Oh

[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:34.920]
He'll give our civil rights the wavy

[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:36.080]
Oh

[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:38.260]
I think the talent has been nasty

[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:40.380]
No, but they're ballet

[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:44.440]
Well he's a very wealthy dude

[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.620]
With very passion

[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:47.600]
Who's ever played his dude

[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:49.340]
By the skill of his crew

[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:50.320]
Sing hard

[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:52.020]
Sing hard

[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:54.960]
Sing hard

[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:57.460]
And he's much more

[01:50:58.180 --> 01:51:00.560]
And he's a talent happy daddy

[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:03.100]
Go the best of ways

[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:06.960]
Come on, let's do this

[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.360]
Come on, let's do this

[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:12.620]
Come on, let's do this

[01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:14.420]
Also we've been for years boys and girls

[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:15.120]
I'll tell you this

[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:16.220]
But of course, everyone, our little kids

[01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:17.000]
Get to go to camp

[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000]
They'll all be dressed in the same

[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:18.580]
It'll be great

[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:20.880]
Here's a mobile and four-letter deal

[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:21.720]
Hello

[01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:22.660]
Hey Neil

[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:23.180]
Yes sir

[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:24.780]
Hey happy birthday, first of all

[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:25.520]
Thank you so much

[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:26.760]
Yeah, I wanted to tell you

[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:28.500]
After listening to you show the last couple days

[01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:29.560]
You were right on target

[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.160]
As far as the way this arena is running

[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:32.200]
You know, I've listened to

[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:34.180]
I even called them up and complained about the service

[01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:35.120]
I wanted to share with them

[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:37.620]
They have no idea what they're going to do to fix the parking

[01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:40.560]
No idea what they're going to do to fix the possession

[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:42.760]
So they have to keep playing like that

[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:45.360]
So they never thought about that upfront huh?

[01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:47.600]
Yeah, it looks like all of a sudden in arena

[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:48.520]
Just kind of popped up

[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:50.480]
And they said, hey, let's fill the road system for it

[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:50.940]
That's right, that's right

[01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:53.640]
That's right, let's go ahead and put concession people in place

[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:55.420]
Since they started the season already

[01:51:55.420 --> 01:51:57.640]
Yeah, I got to say it's absolutely horrendous

[01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:58.920]
And they ain't like that

[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:01.180]
They opened the gates an hour and a half before game time

[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:02.480]
But if you go to the concession stand

[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:04.080]
It'll have dinner there before you enjoy the game

[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:05.620]
All the way to that, no matter what you want

[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:06.860]
It's not ready yet, are you crazy?

[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:09.540]
Yeah, if you go to the concession stand an hour and a half

[01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:11.080]
At least you can make the second period

[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:12.140]
Right, there you go

[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:13.120]
Hey have a good day

[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:14.740]
Okay pal, I'll see you there Wednesday nights

[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:17.420]
Black Hawks, there should be easy pickings

[01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:19.180]
After we knocked the stuff and out of them

[01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:21.340]
And Friday night in Chicago, anybody believe we're going to do it again?

[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:22.300]
No, come on

[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:24.300]
Mobile in Hellendale, hello

[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:25.440]
Hello

[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:25.560]
Hello

[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:26.180]
Yes sir

[01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:30.120]
Sitting at the Hellendale Beach Bridge

[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:31.440]
Trying to head on to A1A

[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:32.640]
Oh yeah

[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:35.020]
Yeah, I'd get there a lot of there real fast if I were you

[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:36.980]
Well, the bridge is only two lanes

[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:37.760]
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine

[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:38.980]
You're aging by the second

[01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:40.000]
Ah, by the second

[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.840]
I didn't get a chance to shake your hand though

[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:43.140]
I think the last Wednesday night

[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:45.360]
You were coming up the elevator with a friend of yours

[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:47.600]
And I just happened to be checking out the place

[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:49.200]
at campus stadium and it was a thrill

[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:49.640]
Right

[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:52.440]
It was a thrill off your renaissance me

[01:52:53.140 --> 01:52:53.860]
Oh, okay

[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:54.800]
I sure love the rena

[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:57.100]
I understand what you're talking about with the guys

[01:52:57.100 --> 01:52:59.660]
Listen to the naked eye, it looks spectacular

[01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:01.720]
I mean, you look at that place, it's a palace

[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:04.000]
It's, you know, they just got some things there and out

[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.880]
One of one of which would be a real team out there would be nice

[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:09.740]
Well, that doesn't even matter to the facility itself

[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:13.060]
It looks beautiful, yeah

[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:18.160]
I've got, I have a band I'd like to send you the CD

[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:20.160]
They're equivalent to the factory boys

[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:21.400]
In fact, it's John Ra

[01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:24.440]
And my son is the saxophone player in the band

[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:24.780]
Okay

[01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:26.380]
And the band's name is Big Sky

[01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:27.220]
Big Sky

[01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:30.420]
And if you like what you hear, they'd love to come and play

[01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:31.760]
George will give you the address

[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:32.700]
Thanks

[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:36.100]
Hang on, no, not for them to come and play just for the CD

[01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:38.400]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood, hello

[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:41.080]
Yeah, hello, I demand a stick in Yale Rouges

[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.460]
Is there a habitual satellite offender?

[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:43.660]
Yeah, speaking

[01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:44.580]
Speaking

All right, me, how you doing?

[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:46.240]
Okay

[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:51.040]
I'm going to get a bicycle and start driving around in Fort Lauderdale without a decal

[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:53.040]
That's what I'm going to do, that's what kind of a criminal I am

[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:55.380]
Listen, I want to get this thing before voting to you tomorrow

[01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:57.800]
This guy was never elected even dog cancer, correct?

[01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:58.220]
Yeah

[01:53:58.660 --> 01:53:59.820]
What a country man

[01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:01.960]
Listen, I have a question about the Astundee Palace

[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:04.720]
I have to go up to Atlanta tomorrow

[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:09.040]
Can I put an Astundee balance when I come back on Wednesday or not?

[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:15.860]
Wednesday, I put about 50,000 in a day and have each one of your 400 friends put in about 50,000 I might tighten it up a little bit

[01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:17.220]
Like they didn't Miami

[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:20.920]
In fact, well let's you know how many you have to put in on Wednesday morning

[01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:23.000]
Here's a mobile in Fort Myers, hello

[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:24.620]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:25.180]
Okay sir

[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:26.540]
Happy birthday from Fort Myers

[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:29.560]
Thank you so I'll call from Fort Myers before the bidder end today

[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:31.700]
Oh, it's been a picture bidder day today man

[01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:33.000]
I don't know

[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.340]
My first time I came back once a day I get to Red Wing

[01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:35.980]
Oh, sorry

[01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:41.160]
And yeah, it was, it was, my time when the fans got there at the second and the first of the mission the game was already over

[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:41.840]
It was a big moment

[01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:47.480]
But we've got our own little, my only hockey team starting up here next week or so our stadium's gonna be done

[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:49.400]
We've already thrown it out between the two

[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:54.580]
I tell you one thing, those madadors on set the world on fire see they had 2100 for their third home game in the season

[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:56.800]
Well, I run like close to bigger than the fans as I've ever told them

[01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:00.340]
I feel sorry for what's the guy's name, what's the Snyder, whatever the guy's name

[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:04.500]
I feel sorry for them because they're trying to promote something in a place that just don't cut it

[01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:08.420]
Well, good afternoon, go kiss the man over there

[01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:09.580]
They're kicking ass in four miles

[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:11.900]
You team and they're actually putting some people in there

[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:19.440]
Well, we're almost out of time here today and what can I say if we had any response on the problem here with the bonus check

[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:20.860]
No, any response from inside?

[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:21.240]
No

[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:21.700]
Outside?

[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:22.020]
No

[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:22.740]
Legal people?

[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:24.260]
No, aliens?

[01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:24.780]
No

[01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:27.460]
Okay, just check it on it, I realize it's not important

[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:30.620]
And I've only had one sick day since I've been here in over 10 months

[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:34.440]
So I guess you know why the hell I maybe a little of birthday party over at mommy's house tomorrow

[01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:36.440]
Starting about 11 o'clock in the morning

[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:38.100]
What are you smiling about?

[01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:42.100]
I mean not even to have a response, not even for there to be a reply

[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:45.800]
It's like don't you understand, you'll get it when we're good and ready

[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:49.280]
Maybe Wednesday, maybe after you go on vacation, pour us whenever we get around with

[01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:52.520]
See, I've played that game before, remember the last time?

[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:53.060]
Right

[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:58.300]
With a sick wife on the plane, with somehow, and what they had to do with them writing a check in four miles

[01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:00.400]
I have no idea anywhere, Naples, where they're earlier

[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:03.960]
What they had to do with them writing a check in setting it over here, since they sign it

[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:07.660]
I just want to make sure that Joe knows some vacation that needs to have a, you know,

[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:09.060]
Freedmen or creepers stand there

[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:10.420]
But that's still on vacation?

[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:11.120]
Or that no

[01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:17.780]
This guy is on permanent vacation, even Steve Tyler was ever on permanent vacation like this guy

[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:21.480]
It is absolutely unbelievable
