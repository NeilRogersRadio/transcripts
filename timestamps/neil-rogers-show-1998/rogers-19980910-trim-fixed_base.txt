[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]
The QAF, you can hit my rear end.

[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.340]
She wasn't in town for the president,

[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.160]
barely on, she wasn't sure what it meant,

[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.000]
but he was so...

[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.640]
This is the sense to show her.

[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.600]
He took her on a tour of the old old place,

[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.760]
and when they were through the other by a face that he said,

[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.320]
no, uh...

[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.620]
Oh, the man doesn't know,

[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.960]

[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.700]

[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.240]
Okay.

[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.820]
She's with God as f***ing anywhere through the road.

[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.280]
She fell to her knees and she swallowed him down.

[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:20.720]
She's in slow, uh...

[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.760]
What's going on?

[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.840]
Oh, must've saved conversations on the phones,

[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.080]
I can't help but feel it's bones,

[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.720]
when it came, you had it in his head.

[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.440]
What's going on?

[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.200]
She said, feel it,

[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.540]
I'm not the wild folks curious man,

[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.260]

[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.140]

[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.400]

yesterday course we had a bum steer as usual from paul harvey junior a good

[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.080]
friend but i he was more accurate than some others

[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.800]
you know i'm saying

[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.940]
he was a little premature it in

[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.760]
court for a little premature he's always had that problem but nevertheless i

[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.140]
mean all these two press conferences with that dot that time smiley thing was

[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.800]
an award winner thanks to us

[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.460]
but that press conference in the day dumbbrowski one where he signed for five more

[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.260]
years is all about you to say the deal is done john hennie's vina team

[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.180]
et cetera so on i'll say thank god for that we're excited as hell about that

[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.180]
we are forming it the mouth about that we're so damn excited

[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.320]
by the way great job great job by new times brine norcras hype that hurricane

[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.880]
you got to get new times you got to go out and actually see this

[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.560]
and they've made up a whole bunch of letters to brine it says thanks to vanyand

[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.400]
daniel brine norcras south Florida's favorite weatherman in a catastrophe

[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.420]
once again managed to muscle his way to center stage and once there he greedily hogged

[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.440]
airtime like an infosima patient in an oxygen tent

[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.220]
as his hurricane coverage showed norcras still hasn't lost his special talent

[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.800]
for breathless panic mongering hyperbole inexplicably though his viewer seemed to

[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.020]
lap it up that is what viewers he has at the lowest rated news program in this

[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.880]
second tier market as a random survey of his recent male revealed norcras

[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.380]
maybe more popular than ever and then he got a bunch of whole uh

[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.620]
fabricated letters here to brine which are beautiful

[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.620]
which i only read you one to give you the uh the uh jizz of the matter

[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.820]
dear brine i'm confused i know from watching your special reports that the

[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.180]
safest room in the house during a hurricane is the bathroom and that for added

[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.460]
protection i should get down in my bathtub anybody ever get down in the bathtub

[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.180]
uh i'll bet since tubs are so sturdy you've suggested that i dragged my

[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.540]
mattress into the bathroom and used it to cover up the top of the tub once i get

[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.420]
inside but i've also heard you say that i can use my tub to stir water because water

[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.160]
is like gold after a hurricane brine when the storm hits am i supposed to get

[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.220]
into my tub while it's full of water and if i cover the top of it with the

[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.600]
mattress hold i ground

[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.820]
alright there you go mr hysteria nice go out for new times even though

[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.540]

[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.360]
intellectual enough for them they don't like me at new times the other one looks

lamenting all right can i get back to this marketing god thing and stop with all this other fault

[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.220]
are all we got a damn radio show to do here the man upstairs it says if you think gridlock on

[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.900]
south Florida roads is reaching biblical proportions you should see the billboards god damn it

pop it obi what part of thou shalt in a show a thou shalt not didn't you understand

[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:49.320]
sign god on interstate 95 and four lotterdale on i 95 that's right the almighty is talking to you

[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.880]
in thousands of other commuters on billboards and buses all over broward county is part of a six

[00:13:53.880 --> 00:14:00.920]
figure slightly a revered ad campaign to get people to turn to religion to turn to the idea isn't

[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:06.220]
to preach to people but the position god is a regular guy oh there we go in that sexist craft

[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:11.280]
again god is a guy who created woman only is an afterthought so that man would have some somebody

[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:17.200]
keeping a busy with no i mean out of the rib he created man even though George says man's

[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.240]
nipples aren't very erotic but nevertheless and there's nothing about a man that's sexual it said

[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:27.140]
maybe his penis but other than that then he created woman out of a rib just so that man would

[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:31.160]
have some some to keep him occupied and some way to reproduce which why do you think of that in

[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.080]
the beginning by the way shouldn't you have known that did he create like the male a chow first

[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.760]
and then the female chow later on he created a male and a female all at once that god man is he

[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.960]
is all screwed up he's just a regular guy see he is he's a regular guy he's not perfect he's got

[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:50.240]
all kinds of problems he tries does he tries that and nothing ever goes right god damn it at any

[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.900]
rate the playfully pious plugs went up on nine billboards the outside of a hundred buses and the

[00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:00.240]
inside of two hundred more on September 1st will remain for three months the price tag Smith

[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:05.340]
wouldn't say but the brown County transit said the bus ads cost about thirty six thousand dollars

[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:10.840]
people are starving to that this is a sin somebody's gonna burn out a lake of fire for wasting this

[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:16.480]
money we got homeless people we got people starving to this we got a man who can't even afford any more

[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:22.440]
goddamn prosa because he's feeding it all the way stamp dog and they're wasting 36 grand on that

[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:27.620]
the billboard company outdoor systems estimates a sign on i95 cost between eight and 15 grand a

[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.040]
month that's just for one month that's just for one sign for one month so we're talking maybe

[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:39.460]
about the grand he released for starters which is absolutely unfrieking believable people are

[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:43.540]
starving to that and you're putting up billboards and bus signs that people should be huckin a

[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.840]
china about and not only that but they're threatening people that's right if you take my name and

[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.580]
name and hate it's that wrathful god again who keeps getting pissed off he must listen to that morning

[00:15:52.580 --> 00:16:00.260]
show god definitely listen to the morning show because he says exactly that's what god says

[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.960]
and he says if you're saving to take my name in vain or if you like scratch your nose or if you

[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:10.840]
didle around with the mikes if you blow his nose huh wouldn't that be disgusting they wouldn't

[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.960]
put that on channel guarantee that they wouldn't put that on whammy well in mikes god has no

[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.640]
sense of a strange place looks like a nose anybody ever have glasses on there well maybe if they're

[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:31.440]
kakao oh jeez i can't believe you said that there you go so we got the god billboards we got god

[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.460]
bus signs we got got all over the god damn place and if you're wondering why traffic is so bad out

[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.840]
there stop cursing god damn it stop all the cursing will you please and then maybe traffic are

[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:45.880]
like light enough and open up it just like when uh who was it Moses Abraham Solomon Joseph uh

[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.600]
Jehovah's event who was it Moses opened up the red sea there with one flick of a finger he went like

[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.760]
this and the whole damn thing parted given the high sign oh by the way spiggen and given the high

[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.980]
sign i'm coming to work this morning and out there on a county line not a con honey hill road

[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.320]
which is i've dairy and which is also 190 now because in my me date county we not only have to have

[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.060]
two names for the county but every street's got to have at least three or four names to keep you confused

[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.520]
to keep enus the penis in david county so we can't get out he's just locked in he can't get out he's

[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.480]
fighting the good fight he's uh in fact maybe and maybe he'll run off with ron what a match made in

[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:24.200]
heaven that would be enus the penis but i'm coming to work this morning and there's a school zone

[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.860]
up there which they go flying through there i want to salute the mimey day the uh metro cops

[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.880]
okay not just because we got that nice letter yesterday and we saved the business card in case

[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.300]
we ever get a ticket we need it but because this morning they're out there they were under that

[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.180]
overpass over the underpass they were like milling around there they had an operation going on

[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.740]
that was great see i'm not one of these people that's big on all these speed traps

[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.980]
unless it's in an area where people's behavior is dangerous and aberrant and that particular area

[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:55.280]
it'd be bad it'd be bad you come barreland through there and there's a school zone that comes up

[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.120]
on you immediately and they're like all these little kids you know try not to get killed crossing

[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.160]
the road and people just come barreland assing through there on their way to get their water melon

[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.020]
and fried chicken whatever they're on a way to do and they just come zoom in through there

[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.800]
and being the end you know so this morning they're all jammed in there i'm slowing down and they

[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.280]
are cops looking me i give them the thumbs up and he gives me oh what one of these is what i can

[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:23.900]
thumb up not this one this one dammit oh don't say that so nice going guys you see unlike plantation

[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.960]
where they put a speed trap on hiatus road where there are no there no sidewalks there's no pedestrian

[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:34.460]
traffic there are no houses there's no nothing it's just a speed trap where they very low with

[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:39.000]
the ridiculous speed limit out of 35 miles an hour like shooting fish in a barrel so i'm like in

[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.600]
plantation where they set up these stupid idiotic speed traps in places where there was no need for

[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.260]
them at least over here they're doing it in a spot where people deserve to get nailed including

[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:53.240]
those assholes to go zooming through i can't i just can't believe those people i mean let me ask you

[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:58.180]
this when you see that everybody has slowed down to 15 miles an hour and you're going 60 and weaving

[00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:02.400]
in and out trying to work your way through doesn't it ever dawn on you that maybe there's a reason

[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.740]
that these people are going so slow no no no no you're in a hurry is that it oh i'm sorry

[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:14.100]
they're in a hurry they got to get somewhere real fast before kfc you know cuts off that special

[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.780]
on those chicken cheddar tenders whatever that thing is those look really good if they didn't have

[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.600]
device in this and we had the uh we had those real pussy there on a morning show and even Joe

[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.340]
Rose turned into a real about pansy there at the end of the thing and stuck up but after that phony

[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:43.700]
controversy with Brian Marie and the coach is showing off well thank god terry marisa smart guy

[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:49.260]
and it is not going to be doing any coach show at the radio nice move terry so we don't have to

[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:55.120]
worry about that but because i dared to tell the truth about what a did what a horrible job at all

[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.300]
mistake they made that made me into the enemy i was the bad guy and yes i did hear the last two

[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:03.060]
minutes of randy motor on there this morning randy you're a good guy but you better go back to

[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:08.900]
red here and finish your education okay get a sense of humor i mean yesterday what did i say about

[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.840]
rimmer yesterday i'm sure that i haven't said before he's canadian he's jewish and he's cheap okay

[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:18.720]
he's cheap he's a good guy's a good friend of mine but why do i have to get these hysterical calls

[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.340]
at home especially when everybody else is ripping him and talking about how cheap and i'm talking

[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:31.060]
about people that don't even like them all that much like joe rose and default oh yeah in fact

[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.380]
rimmer was talking yesterday he was over in the new arena and defo was over there doing a

[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.840]
suck it around doing something and he ran over and said hi defo how you doing and defo was stuck

[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:46.640]
for an answer how do you like that he said hey defo how are you and defo was stuck for an answer

[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:52.800]
but at any rate i'm not going to get in the middle all that crap again if there are people

[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:59.960]
associated this hockey organization is the most thin skinned uptight everybody associated with it

[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.160]
is like on pins and needles every moment okay we know the team's going to be very weak this year we

[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.920]
know that don't we uh and now they're talking about oh brine's got to make a decision because this

[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.840]
pot band thing fell through thanks to mike smith and toronto's an asshole and neater mire's got a big

[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.480]
mouth and too much of a pussy to want to go and play in toronto where they got real fans who know

[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:22.540]
the game and know a real floater when they see one so that deal fell through so now by Saturday we

[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.740]
got to have our goal tending situation all nailed down even all Kevin weeks wants more money

[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:34.020]
that he's ever going to be worth and we don't have him signed please don't get Sean Burke i'm begging

[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:38.660]
you guys i don't want to start off on a sour device and though we don't want Sean Burke okay

[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.740]
just ask his wife she'll tell you some stories we're in it why we're gonna hear one

[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:47.860]
goalie that had uh little problems there with his wife he's over in tampon out we already had that

[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:54.340]
but we don't want Sean Burke he's like a human sieve we've already got uh jerk the uh captain jerk

[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:59.660]
to come acclaim we don't need two human sieves but it's gonna be fun over there it's a beautiful arena

[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:04.080]
i'm gonna i'm gonna have a whole different outlook on it this year i'm just gonna go there and have

[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:09.740]
a good time and i'm gonna give my opinions honestly and frankly and tell you exactly what i see

[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.460]
and if there's anybody out there doesn't like it too effing bad that's my comment to you okay

[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.500]
if you're too much of a bunch of pussy and pansy to take honest criticism from somebody knows

[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:23.360]

[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.380]
i'm loaded with lots and lots of good stuff today today is today i come out with all the good

[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:59.180]
crap that's right it's absolutely unconscionable the kind of garbage that comes in from the colors

[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:04.040]
i've said this before i'll say it again these knowledgeable sports colors on this station

[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.120]
yesterday i'm listening to Hank go and home and by the way nice job Hank Hank goes what's going on

[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.180]
kill the first half hour with me they're butchering that uh don smiley press conference which we did

[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:17.360]
a great job thank you it was hysterical and then i heard sunny hursh was on there over chulas with

[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.940]
Hank for a while and then he had Ralph Hawke on a phone to an interview with Ralph Hawke about that

[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:26.240]
61 season was great forget about the god damn colors we ignore how many colors have we gotten

[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:33.000]
this market like one or two oh that's it i mean real colors i'm talking about not these other

[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.760]
phony baloney sucking up for something for free and here's some punk calling in there who's like about

[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:42.280]
20 years old maybe at best who's still waiting for his other testicle to descend probably related to

[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:46.880]
guilty and he's given a seminar because Hank was asking does Roger merris belong in the hall of fame

[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.940]
and by the way i agree with you Hank we do often disagree on things but on this one case

[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:55.820]
Hank is right he don't belong in the hall of fame he had one gigantic year if you know that the

[00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:00.960]
hall of fame is determined membership it is determined by having one great record then he belongs

[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.120]
in a hall of fame but that's not what it's supposed to be it's supposed to be about uh career

[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.680]
accomplishment is what it is Roger merris was not a great baseball player he was a good player

[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:16.840]
he had some good years and one great season but you can have an opinion on that whatever it might be

[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:21.160]
but when you're a little uh eighteen or twenty year old punk who wasn't even born would Roger merris

[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.660]
was playing what the hell do you know what you're talking about and some punk calls in

[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.360]
all the Roger merris did this and he didn't even know what he's talking about he wouldn't know

[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:32.000]
Roger merris if he came back from the dead right now and walked into his house and and bitch laughed

[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.080]
him right across the pussy wouldn't know Roger merris and that's what we got like yoldie getting

[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:42.780]
on there waxing all enthusiastic and emotional about Bobby Thompson's home run in the playoffs in 1951

[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:46.860]
that won the pennant for the giants i got news for a yoldie wouldn't know rust Hodges from

[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:50.640]
gill Hodges from russo wases okay that's what yoldie knows about bobby Thompson

[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:57.380]
so all these people with a big mouth it's easy to have an opinion like assholes everybody's got one

[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:04.140]
okay like noses everybody's got a nose some bigger than others but for crying out a lot at

[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.440]
least have some idea what you're talking about and don't try to be an expert on stuff that happened

[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:12.300]
years before you even born i'll do little pips squeaks out there oh Roger merris he uh yeah right

[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.000]
good player not a great player does not belong in a hall of fame

[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.280]
let's take criminals again this year join gene decker hop for the play by play right here

Saturday the mayhem yeah buddy hey hey hey do you have bodyguards and well you just don't

[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:32.220]
feel comfortable having them around anymore because you're involved in a lot of illegal activity

[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:37.060]
and some day their testimony could be used against you in a court of law of course we all have

[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:42.440]
that fear that's why the makers of the real doll have created the one and only real guard

[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:48.500]
they it looks and feels like a real bodyguard and even packs he day back or i shoot the important

[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:54.060]
difference is though that this bodyguard can't be subpoenaed into a court of law i saw nothing

[00:30:54.060 --> 00:31:01.060]
i am only here to protect hey you can sell drugs by illegal arms wander money or even do the nasty

[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:06.520]
in the oval office these guys won't ever say a thing once comer the real guard look for

[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:11.980]

got the marlins and arachuses they try for a clean sweep to blow another lead and lose another game

[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:29.560]
they're we're getting real close to a hundred now they're getting close we got john henry's

[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.500]
going to salvage the whole deal he's going to buy the team dave dumbbrowski's sticking around for

[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.320]
another five years and maybe there's hope at the end of the tunnel for you baseball fans all ten of

[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:42.100]
and speaking of the president in these thirty six boxes which i'm sure not going to get bogged

[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.980]

[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:51.560]

[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:56.180]
best information we got so far and they're leaking like crazy like a suit it's all about monica

[00:31:56.180 --> 00:32:01.880]
Lewinsky and blow jobs and cover ups and on line uh et cetera and so on and apolitographic details

[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:07.100]
in there now let me ask you this question if Ken star wasn't politically motivated if he wasn't

[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:10.700]
a puppet of the right wing and Richard melonscape and all these other right wing fanatics and gary

[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:15.520]
bowler and all these other Nazis then why in the world wouldn't make any well how what relevance is

[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.760]
there what positions they were doing and what she did with that cigar et cetera and so on except

[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:25.000]
to appeal to the pure purulent interest and paranoia of the american public which if we

[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.340]
appeal to the purine interest of the public here on a radio on television right away the FCC comes

[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:33.580]
in there start getting psychotic but if the special investigators appealing to the purine interest

[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:39.320]
of the public i mean there is every wild story that this and let me say it again what kind of a

[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:45.500]
woman goes into a congressional which is going to become a congressional inquiry now to the special

[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:51.040]
investigator testified washing in dc and goes into graphic detail about how she was masturbating

[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:55.260]
with a president cigar and doing this and sticking as to what is what kind of a bitch is that

[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.660]
that goes in there and has to go into a every graphic detail under the sun which is why the

[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:08.100]
politicians are squirming like crazy exactly you said it you said it best that is the american fn

[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:14.700]
way that everybody's got to be all psychotic in the nervous because now it's not just it's not

[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:19.900]
something isolated or something you know just intangible it's now something so graphic and

[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:27.220]
real that you can almost smell it oh god you can almost smell it because we got to go through all

[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:31.420]

[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:22.780]
oh now this already read but it's worth repeating again listen very carefully okay open up your ears

[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:29.420]
I'll scolti repeate it says I tune in Spanish radio and listen even though I know only about

[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:35.060]
200 words I get the general gist of what they say they call us North Americanos as opposed to

[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:40.760]
regular Americans I know a lot of regular Americans they use dukelax it says I keep a clipping from

[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:46.500]
the Los Angeles Times in my wallet this is what it says on one side of the debate are some Latino

[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:51.700]
politicians like former Miami Mayor Maurice Faray who told the Tampa Tribune in 1982 that within

[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:56.580]
10 years there wouldn't be a word of English spoken English is not Miami's official language one day

[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:02.640]
residents will learn Spanish or leave end of quote from the anxious Maurice Faray when I publish

[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:08.440]
my books as enus the penis which is a master plan for the retaking of American date county that's

[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:13.900]

[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:28.440]
living you just in lockstep with himself this man refuses to graduate from this mentality fossils

[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.840]
who were meant for each other and there was certainly a time back during those ugly nasty crime

[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:37.080]
written days of the burial bullet when we had bodies stewed all over Dixie highway and everywhere else

[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:41.160]
there was a time when you know people had a right to be upset but you know something here it's now

[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.600]
almost 20 years later and this man is still singing the same old stale tune and the herald feels

[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:49.820]
you know the need to put this crap in there like we don't know about Mark Benson and he is Shira

[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:55.060]
enemy shaper and all these other zealots who just keep honking away screaming oh not that I don't like

negative facts here which I'm not gonna you know I learned my lesson yesterday in fact I noticed

[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:40.900]

[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:52.920]
what are you shaking your head about I'm just trying to tell you that locally here the interest is

[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.980]
minimal as compared to the rest of the civilized country because sports are not into it's not

[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:47.180]
uh mark McGuire love fest you're having yesterday yeah uh my I think that's great baseball player

[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:52.320]
decent guy yeah yeah it was spectacular but but before he goes ahead nominating him for

[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.740]
a faint hood you know and gushing about what a great class act he was and all that yeah he was

[00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:01.500]
keeping lines but right after he did that yeah he went ahead with that that craft commercial

[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:05.460]
endorsement for Disney right there on the thing so what about us so what does that mean is this guy

[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:09.160]
not entitled all these other guys do the same thing why should he be different from anybody else

[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:14.520]
well everybody's it's such a pure wonderful moment no I we didn't say that at all nothing

[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:19.540]
is pure about sports anymore about america it's uh it's all about business well you may not have

[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:23.900]
but other colors and people like today in the paper I don't think that most of the colors we had

[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:29.040]
were hostile and uh negative and uh I hated it yeah right I don't understand why people are

[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:34.000]
criticizing somebody you might catch the ball and sell it when this guy is just max let me say

[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.200]
it to you again yeah okay I'm not criticizing people who would sell the ball I'm criticizing people

[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:44.320]
who are knocking those kids who didn't want any money for the ball because the kids weren't that

[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:48.980]
materialistic okay they just wanted an autograph whatever the hell they wanted then they're

[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.860]
criticizing them it's up to the individual if you want to try to sell it for five million bucks if

[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.180]
you caught it which you did not but if you did that's up to you that's your business

[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.760]
but why not knock little kids because that's not their value oh is that not a little kid

[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.800]
well what we're supposed to do tell little kids that the only thing that counts is money uh

[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.900]
is that is that something good that we ought to be teaching and studying in kids that's precisely

[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:12.680]
what he's doing when he does that ad exploits it for all it's worth breaking get out of here go blow it

[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:18.140]
out your ass it's all he's doing is making it into a commercial thing you think they had a

[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:22.840]
thing out there at Bush State and it said big Macland with a big Mac thing on it they don't have

[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:28.540]

starting to move up into we're about now in a half of a show now we're just a thickening

[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:41.300]
did you happen to listen to the first thing this morning i heard little bits and pieces okay i

[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:44.920]
normally don't listen to them i put them on during the commercials i listen to how i

[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.900]
don't during the commercials i put them on yeah they were talking about famous homerun yesterday

[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:55.660]
and the hurls had an article about i guess famous homerun this morning mentioning bobby Thompson's

[01:09:55.660 --> 01:10:01.960]
home run right in the 51 uh playoff yeah these guys were so adamant that the hurls was

[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:06.840]
all about it being a three game playoff theory they were so sure they were ripping the hurls now

[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:12.400]
he's the hurls too but the hurls was right it was a three game playoff theory yeah golly

[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.180]
like can't stand this little twerp yeah was so sure that and how old is this guy 10

[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:25.440]
going on what about six five this guy was so sure ripping and so is deep bow about that it was a

[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:29.300]
one game playoff um start to tell you go that they were three game playoff fact then right

[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:34.200]
uh it's just amazing and that's what i said before and gildey's on there the other day screaming

[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:39.200]
and yelling about bobby Thompson's home run he wouldn't know bobby Thompson from uh from uh Bobby

[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.800]
Schwartz i mean what what does he know about it in 1951 we're talking this good is like 15 years old

[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.880]
what does he know about anything you know i'm only 36 years old but i do read i've been a

[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:54.720]
baseball fan my whole life i do read a lot i watch heel clips right i knew that i wasn't around

[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.580]
but i knew it because i read about it i said we're in the first few minutes of the show today i was

[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:02.660]
screaming about that show they have these people on screaming about stuff they know nothing about

[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:06.860]
and i said that this kid wouldn't know rush huggers from gill Hodges from russell wasis and i'll

[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:12.140]
say it again and he's on there the and you know but that's why that show is so popular because it fits

[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:16.200]
imperfectly in this town like all these idiots calling hankiest today about roger merris who

[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:20.900]
weren't even born when merris was playing baseball and i agree with you you know and i was the

[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:26.800]
marathon as far as in in his history because what the guy did was tremendous but he does not

[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:31.460]
belong in the hall no he doesn't have the stats because he had two productive years yet 39

[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:37.420]
homers and six dandy he had 61 and 61 right and the fact he was mvp two years in row that doesn't

[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:41.740]
make him automatically in the hall of fame he was a lifetime 260 hitter his stats over his career

[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:45.560]
were like you know good he was a good player but certainly not impressive enough to be in the hall

[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:51.020]
of fame i agree with you and in fact it wasn't for the 61 home runs in 61 the make that better

[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:56.360]
stats better stats i mean by we're not in the same ballpark are you kidding me yeah but i'm

[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.920]
talking about the year of 61 oh yeah really of course i mean all the way around they weren't in

[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.620]
the same league manal but he won the mvp i think it was in 56 at three sixty five did merris ever

[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:09.400]
hit close to three sixty five oh of course now he was a two sixty lifetime hitter no but i just

[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.940]
had to get i mean you know that's one that's one of the reasons why but but you see you're just

[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:17.680]
starting to catch on with the sports elements of this station are primarily a lot of people talking

[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.280]
about stuff they don't know about exactly but that's not a fact that if you've got a sports show

[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:26.540]
that's not a fact that you should let live by yeah and then he made us i mean it was two minutes

[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:30.380]
before that that he made another mistake saying that the giants were three games out the one

[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:34.920]
of our great well in fact there too and somebody took on the test on that one yeah i mean if you're

[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:39.900]

Jesus Joseph and Mary that was pretty titillating wasn't it wow okay we have an open line in

[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.280]
to a brown word five six seven oh five sixty oh man i think he owes me a lot more than two grand

[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:47.380]
now let's go to plantation hello i'll go now yes sir how are you doing buddy okay listen i grew up

[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:52.240]
up north and uh pretty good kind of star on that yes but i enjoy your show and everything like that

[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:58.020]
night i hear you and every every day and you talk about like goyam and the schvata and stuff like

[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:02.700]
that and i know you grew up with the terminology of the yiddish of the jewish or whatever it is

[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:08.820]
yeah but what difference what's the difference between saying goyam schvata or kike what do you

[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:14.440]
mean by that well i just mean like it's like saying because kike can never be a kike is automatically a

[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:18.120]
derogatory term schwarze it just means a person who's black goyam means a person who's not

[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:24.040]
Jewish how do you know how do we know how do i just say no no no how do we know that it's not a

[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:29.700]
derogatory remark when you say goyam i hear goyam every day and you use it in like a in a bad

[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:34.660]
sense you know i mean i don't know a bad sense well you say like the goyam don't do this they don't do

[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:39.820]
that so what's the difference between a kike and i you know i'm saying like a kike because a kike is

[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:49.140]
Jewish that's why yeah yeah so what i'm saying is like you what are you saying sir don't say i

[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:53.820]
speak when he's here there's a humorous show if you don't have a sense of humor then you want to

[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:21.860]
this joint is George asked me off the year about a half hour ago is it like official that he's

[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:26.320]
filling in on my vacation i said as far as i'm concerned the answer is yes because you know

[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.400]
the powers that be around here we don't hear from them we hear nothing you know i'm going on

[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:34.640]
vacation in a couple of weeks and this guy is going to be doing the show and they're just they

[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:39.100]
just and like i've said before as long as there is sound coming out of this studio between ten

[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:44.540]
and a spot's good on here they don't care what it is it could be for four hours they don't

[01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:50.840]
care what the other sound is well i don't know if i'd go on vacation if i were you yeah i'm not worried

[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:55.460]
coming up that show uh uh i got a good contract in fact i'll tell you what i'll make a deal with

[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:59.160]
George i'll sit in there and answer the phones and run the board he can do the show for the next

[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:03.340]
four years and i'll just take let's don't take this and pay checks i mean i'm not giving up any

[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:06.860]
in my cash because you know i'm at the end of the line here but uh it's okay with me

[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:10.960]
well you know he was a bit of new junior but he had his own head on the shoulders and he had his

[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:14.840]
own the theory he's definitely got his own head no question about that i don't want no head from him

[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:18.700]
uh uh but no one was in there or any of the freedom uh who's going to be on tonight then on the

[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:23.900]
TV is it going to be George again me okay he don't know overdo it okay yeah i remember when

[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:29.940]
wally pipplo and lu gary deck glove okay i'm not there playing that game uh but my advice if George

[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:34.900]
was in another market he could dominate yeah i think when dixie he'd be pretty good

[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:41.360]

a Honduran Honduran yeah oh man look out no she's white she's white and i don't i don't understand

[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:54.240]
it he's white he thinks that cuba's the only island that the spaniards went and lived in uh

[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:59.260]
it's plenty well he's wrong is that what is it the counter Honduras for this plenty of white people

[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:02.960]
and i don't like it i can pre-heather there's a lot of white people in Santa Barbara you know and i

[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:07.280]
bet the guy that just called you i bet he's a Cuban the guy that was just make a fun here without

[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:11.600]

[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:16.400]
and i you know and i was watching the show the other on last night on whammy and he was he was also

[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:22.260]
talking about well i'm i'm from europe i'm from a fifth world country but my family's from europe my

[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:28.240]
ancestors your ancestors okay my ancestors are from russia and i'm embarrassed about it they're from

[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:33.440]
many of them are white people in america as well no central america okay we're saying this guy

[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:37.320]
this guy's a good guy and then he put up ten question marks as he thought you might not be Cuban

[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:41.620]
no i think you might be a Puerto Rican he really hates the Puerto Rican my grandparents are spaniards

[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:45.360]
and let me tell you when i went to spain they treated us like crap do they say esparanpa

[01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:51.960]
there you know like that but i mean i don't i don't like that he says oh like all central america's

[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:57.000]
i want to say one thing before you let me go and get that because no you get all other his spanics

[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.540]
i don't even know why he accepts Cubans are a bunch of uh shfartses i think is what you said

[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:05.460]
what Neil said today early on you know what you said you said there either like a half reads or

[01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:08.740]
indians or shfartses but definitely not like white people so something like that

[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:13.120]
Neil let me say one thing yeah Cubans came to this country as refugees

[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:18.360]
the central and south americans are coming here as immigrants and as a refugee you get a lot more

[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:22.780]
help from the government yeah and that's something that a lot of you gotta say right you gotta say

[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:26.900]
refugee you gotta say right uh the kill out of the Cubans that did come here in the sixties they

[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:31.620]
were educated they had a lot of they were middle and upper class Cubans that's why they were

[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:36.640]
here that's like a refugee yeah that's why they were able to adjust in the united states and we

[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:41.240]
have to understand that these people coming now are very poor they have lack of education and it's

[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:45.020]
gonna take more time for them i think i like i think i like the Colombians the best you know

[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:50.300]
i'm an atheist Neil i believe you know 100% will you say oh yeah i think i used to you that's right

[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:55.240]

finally i you know i'd rather give him or any general manager of a hundred dollar salary

[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:40.300]
than a best mediocre ball player getting paid more than that and uh forch is one of the few

industries where the management makes less than the employees yeah and that's really just you know

[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:50.420]
all i want to say okay thank god bless you he had a fact that brosky said he's gonna stay here for five

[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:18.060]
the marlin's blue now let's talk some baseball isn't that the name of the show let's talk about Ryan

[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:22.960]
Durin and while Jim constady and all that great yanky pitching staff Louis a royal whitey Ford

trying to earn you know yeah alcohol problems you don't take shots at him i'm not taking shots

[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:32.480]
into me at glasses you know what Ryan Durin looked like yeah i do you know that when he used to warm

[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:36.280]
up on the agreement from the bullpen and warmed up he used to throw purposely hit the screen with

[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:40.440]
a couple of pitches he used to throw so hard and they had bad eyesight legitimately and had no

[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:44.220]
idea where the ball was going and they have headers used to freak out exactly that was one of his

[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:48.520]
best assets that's right now our lighter you talk about that all the time it's called purpose

[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:55.260]
purposely wild yeah although he probably didn't do it on purpose um-hmm share what do you think
