[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700]
Oh, we're sorry the teller made an error. I don't know. We're supposed to be two people there when they open the envelope from the ATM and

[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.840]
I'll put you 2750 back in your account, but nothing nothing happens to the teller, but you know

[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.820]
You want to get good service next time you go there talk to the security guard. He'll get you straight. Oh the whack-and-nut guy

[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.920]
Yeah, he'll get you straight now. Yeah, he's a whack-and-nut. Okay. The wacky guy. He's whacking it

[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.580]
I mean maybe maybe it's only me maybe again. It's my peculiarities. I'm an eccentric old fart whatever it is

[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:35.160]
But I just find it very bizarre that when I would call my bank the security guard would answer shoot for you know, I

[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.760]
Don't get it

[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.540]
Too open line. I'm probably the only person in all of America who would be kind of taken a back by that

[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.400]
Yeah, and not even answered by saying

[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.220]
I mean I call bank, you know like like a business. Hello

[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.640]
You know, I figured maybe I got the wrong number and then as time is going along here

[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.880]
I realize I don't have the wrong number. They haven't like a grab as part of you over there in a bank

[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.160]
Two open lines and date five six and past eleven o'clock. You got it sports radio five sixty

[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.480]

[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.520]
Kill the cold

[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.380]
I'm really sure why in fact, I'm always in a mood to hear that it's eleven fifteen at five sixty w Q

[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.840]
I want to thank my close personal friend Richard over at Emory Coast. They are the nicest people on the face of the earth

[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.480]
They wrote a letter to our sales department

[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.300]
It's a testimonial letter about the tremendous effect of advertising on their show and on this station and about their new

[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.320]
Location in North Miami Beach and how their opening has been far beyond what they were expected thanks to this show in my large

[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.260]
Loyal audience and you people out there Emerald Coast. Do we love them or why great?

[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.080]
But I mean this letter I've now you know over the years you get a lot of nice letters from sponsors saying yeah

[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.620]
We got great results and it's so but this is just this ought to be framed

[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.900]
It is just beautiful. Thank you, Richard

[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.500]
And I'll see you there this weekend by the way, and oh this well maybe one of these days this weekend maybe Saturday

[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.060]
We have an open line of date Rocky game on Sunday George life revolves around a hockey games

[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.060]
Maybe you tell by these dynamic hockey calls we get

[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.480]
I promise about the ice being so bad. We've had at least no calls about that

[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.940]
They don't know what it's all about. That's why they keep going back there and they're having a great time

[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.020]
Man, they just be bad today hey

[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.240]
Come on play it louders little louder more distorted come on louder. That's it. Right get up. Hey

[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.680]
You have a good time you believe us believe it. No, come on work on it. Get anyway. Oh

[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.880]
God why he said that

[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.600]
Let's go to a mobile in Delray Beach hello

[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.480]
Hello, Neil. Yes

[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.620]
Hey, what you're saying about the ice is right on man look at Evanton. They scored a quick point up

[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.400]
Edmonton according to that thing in a paper

[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.000]
Do they wish I guess you also saw it got the only really great ice in the whole national hockey league and the rest of the league sucks

[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.380]
And the worst ice is in these new buildings like the Macarena building

[00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.520]
Hey, you know it's funny about your security guard. Yeah

[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.480]
He knocked down the cleaning lady to answer it no doubt

[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.660]
Unbelievable. Is that incredible story? It's a true story. I absolutely believe it in fact

[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.200]
That's the second year the second call the woman voice that was probably the cleaning lady right?

[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.320]
I

[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.760]
Mean I said is this so and so bank and there was like

[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.340]
Like a long pause and like like I caught them in the middle of something

[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.920]
Like maybe they were all in the vault together. I have no idea what was going on over there

[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.320]
And then all of a sudden it was kind of like a slow, you know, you hear the phone go like on the cradle like very slowly and like

[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.800]
Well, we don't have time for this Brad because there's nobody here that knows nothing right now

[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.060]
I

[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.200]
Mean one one thing I've discovered about doing business is that if it's a bank if it's a

[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.460]
Shoestor whatever it is you'll find people

[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.760]
Who really one or two people in most places a couple of people that really have their

[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.560]
Together, okay really know what's going on and then you'll find like a whole bunch of other people who have who are clueless

[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.580]
Kind of like around here when you come right down

[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.100]
There's us me and George and then

[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.100]
Okay, where do we go?

[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.120]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood hello

[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.180]
Hey, a long time first time all right anyway, you were talking about your 2k and

[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.940]
I was talking about it that doofol was talking about it. Oh, well you mentioned it as well too

[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.500]
That's what we have to look forward to anyway my employer just sent a letter to all the

[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.960]
10,000 plus employees saying that

[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.080]
Very okay great. He said the

[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.920]
It's the fan

[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.100]
We have an open effect that's it. Do you see I'm this morning? It'll hold big face full because the hit the fan

[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:54.000]
Yeah, open line of David. I just I'm sorry. I hate to keep talking about him and and now I understand why people hate me like poison

[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.100]
Are still drawn to the show and you're listening right now?

[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.860]
It no, it's kind of a perverse thing. I in the morning. There's nothing to watch anyway

[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:08.000]
You know, I'm getting ready to come to work. I'm sitting there taking all my vitamins and my my blood pressure medicine like extra doses before I come in here and

[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.080]
What

[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.260]
Oh Jesus this is embarrassing this hell

[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:24.140]
Matt yes, yes, yes you what's going on man? I've phone is light enough. What do you what's what's going on about a security guard?

[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.940]
You don't know the story I I've heard bits and pieces from people calling me here

[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.320]
We we don't have a security guard. Well, whatever the guy is well

[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.680]
Maybe he was just hanging out having fried chicken. I don't know it could be we have fried chicken

[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.720]
Everyone well there you go see that must have been Monday must have been fried chicken day

[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.880]
And you were out so you didn't get get any what happened

[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.480]
What happened was that I got one of those little notices in the mail

[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.800]
That said that I was overdrawn and it was somebody's mistake over there because I made it a positive and a

[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.700]
Wrote myself a check like I always do at the same time

[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.680]
So it was like a little a clerical error, which is no big deal

[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.820]
And I called there and you weren't there and the phone rang several times. There's this 330 on Monday and finally a

[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:10.400]
Dark-complexed person answered the phone you talking guy or a girl guy a guy

[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.760]
Oh

[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:19.000]
There's nobody here that fits that description and I said is Matt there is a I think she's here

[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.960]
I thought she must be on having that sex change. He's been talking about all these years man

[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.180]
I don't know it. I don't know what happened and so then there was like a long pause and some young lady came on

[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.020]
And I said is this Republic security bank and she's

[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.420]
And then there was like a long pause and then I heard the dial tone you called my number

[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.020]
Yes, and I called the number back

[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.960]
And I know it was the right number because she picked it up cold at next time this young lady and then I explain her the mistake

[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.700]
And she went better be better move better and while I said just tell me what the balance shows now

[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.220]
And of course it was plus you know a thousand dollars whatever. I said okay, then I guess it's been straightened out

[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.200]
But I just found it very and she said oh, Matt's not here today

[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.900]
He's out the hijacking somebody's car doing something. I don't know

[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:08.820]
You know what happens is we've got a phone here that is available for customers to use if they want to call their girlfriend or wife or whatever

[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:14.960]
Oh, and it might be that when you called you were calling in when someone was trying to call out and they picked up the phone

[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.320]
We're gonna have to take that phone away from the the customer service area

[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:25.460]
I thought it was a security guard. Oh, well, no, we don't we don't have one of those. Yes, you do I swear we don't have a security guard

[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.520]
What is that guy that's always standing in the lobby there?

[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.640]
He's just hanging out waiting for the chicken to come in what guy are you talking about?

[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.240]
There's often a guy that stands there with a black outfit on I

[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.500]
Don't I don't know who you're speaking of sometimes we got some jobs that come in here to make their deposits or

[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:49.000]
Not a cop like a security guard outfit. Maybe he just posing as the security guard. I don't know. We haven't had security guard in about two years

[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.360]
Yeah

[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:57.000]
So the bottom line is we didn't charge you anything right no no there's no problem with that that parts all straightened out okay

[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.260]
But it was just a bizarre

[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.040]
Experience you know I'm calling the bank

[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.000]
Expecting to talk to a real living and breathing person. Well, that's like some huh?

[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.800]
That's me also work, but you weren't there and so evidently some bulls are just decided he would pick up the phone

[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.540]
You know what usually it's like if you were walking past a pay phone

[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:19.940]
You know you've seen this happen you're walking past a public pay phone and it starts ringing and some people actually will pick it up

[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:25.460]
People do that right that that very well might be what happened and I'm gonna take just because of this

[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.020]
I'm taking the phone away from there. So anybody else wants to use the phone now. I'm gonna get blamed for that

[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.020]
Well, hey, what can I tell you that goddamn meal took our public phone away?

[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:40.040]
And we get lots of people the mail man. He's probably listening to you right now. He comes to use my phone every day

[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.960]
Here you go, but when I'm getting even with him

[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.900]
I apologize if you call here and you have a problem

[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:51.700]
You know who you are he told me to beat me and call my cellular phone or whatever that you this this should not have happened

[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.540]
I apologize for that

[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.580]
Anybody who's listening to me out there. This is not normal procedure

[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.780]
We don't have a security guard and if we did we wouldn't have a man to run the phone

[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.620]
Well, you had one for one day anyway

[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.620]
I would go check the fault if I were you out quick. I'm gonna go back there right now and check it

[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:12.380]
Okay, man. Hey, I'm sorry about no problem. All right. See you. Bye. There's my good buddy Matt from Republic Security Bank

[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.600]
So these are great guys get you right on the phone air tastes good care of me not good enough

[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.060]
But hey, he's got a wife, you know, we have an open line and date one and brown

[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.440]
Maybe that's what it was all about

[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.120]
Maybe there's just a couple of

[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.320]
Intruder's there who just happened to be wandering by the phone right?

[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:28.980]
Oh

[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.700]
Look at this five car accident i95 north-throwed approaching baby bull of heart

[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.920]
Oh, and by the way that bull that they were talking about yesterday that was not all the newscast that got loose

[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.200]
Was that on Davy road?

[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.520]
Oh, I don't I don't recall I thought that I didn't hear because I saw because I was driving home from my

[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:50.160]
Some lunch yesterday and I'm driving up Davy Road extension to 595 and I look over to the left there

[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.100]
And I see all these cop cars. There's a camera crew and I must have been the bull over there

[00:09:54.100 --> 00:10:00.060]
That got loose which got tremendous coverage by the way you had a thought it was one of the most important stories and history man time

[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.620]
Little bit of loose

[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.700]
Bull in town

[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:10.280]
Anyway, the two left lanes of i95 northbound are blocked two cars of overturned delays are building rapidly back to rippen road

[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.360]
So if you're thinking about going northbound on i95 in that general area, I would be forgiven

[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.160]
Hit the Hershey highway

[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.540]

Postal imposta

Wouldn't you know those Greeks would have a hole in the wall huh?

[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.900]
Right go. Yeah, I don't think he's talking about that kind of a hole in a nice going Alan. Do you ever have a way with words or what?

[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.460]
Hole in the wall with very fresh salads

[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.160]

No, the Inuit Indians they have this language, but like little

[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.620]
Good answer like this and how do you speak symbol? It's like trying to figure out how

[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.380]

So finish is that kind of a language you look like that Indian it's got like instead of like tradition

I mean you'll look at some of the names of the streets like regulier beer or I start out

[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.000]
They're like 700 letters. I mean just uh, you know

[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.640]
You just become familiar because the arrow is pointing in the right direction and there's the place called conscious dreams over there

[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.040]
And the youth hostel meeting place and you got some idea that you're getting close to the right part of town

[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.840]
But in a possible language the only great thing being though is that everybody under the age of 100 over there speaks

[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:57.320]
English so no excuses okay for all you put these you want to go to London because you were afraid to go somewhere they know speak in English

[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:06.720]
People like that to me are just such party poopers people are to afraid to go like to Italy or to France or any place else because they know speak in English

[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.880]
Go to Italy that's half of the front of it

[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.660]
Because in all the big cities in Italy like Rome and Milan and for insor Florence

[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.100]
They're they're catered. They're geared toward tourism

[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.580]
And so you're going to be a trottery as the little mom and pop restaurants and again many of the places they have little baskets of menus

[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.940]
And they'll have the menu in Italian of course, but also in Spanish and English in uh, Chinese

[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.940]
Lots and lots of Asians by the way in Italy. It'll be like you're promoting by legalism buster

[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.620]
No, I'm promoting smart tourism

[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.000]
As opposed to the guy being French which if you don't speak French they won't yield an inch

[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.640]
You go to Paris if you know if you can't understand a little bit of the menu in French

[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.480]
Forget it because they will not accommodate you. They don't give a crap take your American money and vote out your ass

[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.640]
They don't want to know from you

[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:02.160]
But in Italy you go to any place and they will accommodate you whatever English it would a language you speak because they watch your money good business

[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.900]
Here's a mobile in for a lot of deal. Hello. Neil good morning. Yes, sir. How are you great? Well

[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.040]
I worked the fetch of the subject you were just talking about about racial and so forth

[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:20.040]
My wife of the past 15 years prior to me uh, marrying her she was assaulted twice

[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:25.580]
By black men. Therefore she has uh, black the borders. Both of them

[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:31.240]
Wonderful children. Both of them married and well one of them is we don't write now

[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.740]
But uh their kids are white

[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.440]
Now imagine the dogs are complexed uh

[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.080]
Mother where's that the the children one time somebody's through

[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.540]
Is the same as a white man is the same as an Asian is the same as anybody else absolutely

[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:53.680]
And like I told someone a long time ago that person you just called the uh the one the epithet the n word

[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.520]
That maybe that end will save your life one day mm-hmm and

[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.560]
That's what I have to say Neil great. Well, we love you. Have a great life. Bye. Bye. Sure

[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.940]
Okay, we have an open don't forget this Saturday

[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:10.820]
New Year that our promotion department and ourselves the manager all these people are working feverishly with Carol

[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.020]
It's in a one to make sure that if remember we raised the 20 grand for Phil

[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.180]
On his CD for a charity that doesn't even not even hear it's a lost annualist charity

[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.560]
And we raised 20 grand for Phil like in a few weeks like in no time at all

[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.560]
And then and I'm gonna say this in all honesty. I love Philly's a great talent

[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.720]
All you can eat Negro that one bit on there's one of the funniest things in a history of Ancine

[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.100]
There are a couple of other cuts on there that are you know pretty amusing and the rest of it is

[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.900]
You know you can take it or leave it. You know what I'm saying

[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:46.120]
Have we ever had to be clicked for any other cut on that CD ever? No, no more group is your thing

[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.480]
What is it? Margarit beats your kids. Yeah, Marley that now that's another one's pretty good

[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.100]
But I mean it's so I'm not knocking but I'm saying that there's that one great fit on there

[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.900]
But we got a thousand of those sold in a heartbeat in a few weeks

[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.660]
20 grand no fuss no must your problem

[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.240]
But here we're trying to do our own thing and man

[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.760]
Are we having problems up the old record two open lines indeed. Why am I hello?

[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.920]
Hey, good morning. Yeah, sir. Uh, will you hang up on me if uh

[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:22.600]
If you keep talking like this. No, if I disagree with you about what

[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.500]
Well, I'm looking because I

[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.280]
I can't get a good beyond

[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.560]
Yeah, yeah, sounds like you're already taken one of the phone okay

[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.140]
Open line and uh, brown one go over to Britain okay

[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.440]
They'll sympathize with the most of the British haven't had a good in years

[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.900]
That's why they have that constipated mentality plus they can't get they can't cut the umbilical cord man

[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.060]
They can't get rid of that royal family

[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.520]
Which is why the men over there are like pussy and sissy all of them

[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.960]
Well, that's the big sex scandal by the way

[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.920]

What is so kiss? Yeah, it's a holiday

[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.960]
Okay, well, that's over all I can tell you is a holiday out to over and it just sounds very funny

[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.340]
And I'm very funny and I want to say it but I got to know what it is and it comes to every year

[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.520]
It just just like some of us where you come is every year. Okay, no, I love you

And maybe we'll have like a real do you call in and tell us what circus really is?

[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:34.100]
Give us some of the background bubble my seas behind circus because every Jewish holiday just like everybody else's holiday

[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.800]
It's got to have a sufficient amount of bubble my seas fairy tales behind it

[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.080]
Otherwise, what's the point of celebrating?

[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.380]
Sookus and you know, I'm Kipper and we got the Shavuas and we got Simha Stora and we got Purim and we eat the Haman Toshin

[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.240]
We got some really great neat holidays

[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:58.400]
And the only reason that there's you I'm Kipper the day of a tumble when everybody's supposed to fast is to make up for all the other Jewish holidays when you're supposed to pick out

[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.920]
It's kind of like the yin and the yang you have to like balance it on. So what am I gonna have for lunch here today by the way?

[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.200]
Well, what do you like agonizing reading your hands about it since I noticed you already ate?

[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:15.800]
I just hadn't left overs from yesterday's left over one Greek salad speaking of the Greek Greek salad

[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.000]
Oh, by the way the rumor is that they're lined up at the tourist bureau office now

[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.900]
They're all in a way to Amsterdam to find that little Greek hole in the wall

[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:31.720]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line anybody out there can tell us what Sookus is no what the significance is no

[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:36.860]

[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.160]
Here's a mobile in Davie. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir

[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.540]
Yeah, I was watching your show last night. Oh, you're the one

[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:50.600]
Hey, I gotta look how do you like that audio? Huh? You must have a good set if you clear this sound

[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.520]
Yeah, hey listen. Can I give you a little bit of criticism about what?

[00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:01.860]
Well, you know just the TV show I think I don't lose about 40 pounds lose the chin and cut that bow off above your right eye

[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.100]
Uh-huh anything else?

[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.780]
Uh, yeah, get a son tan. I've seen better tens on note anything else

[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.060]
Oh, he's got that radio crank up in the back. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much there. I hope you enjoy it

[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.340]
He was the one that wants to show. He's a critiquing. We have an open-minded power

[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.940]
If I end of course you can't even hear the sounds of what does that say about him?

[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:26.280]
5 6 7 0 5 60. It's like the people with assures when that show first started. Oh, he's wearing a blue shirt today

[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.680]
He's got the orange shirt on tomorrow and then he's got the Puse shirt on Wednesday

[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.140]
That was the extent of involvement in the TV show from the radio audience

[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.960]
I mean we had a lot of people watching out there

[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.680]
But it was a whole different group of people not that people listened during the daytime once was more than enough for them

[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:51.180]
But there was a whole different avenue of people out there who were actually watching even this asshole who knows exactly where the mole is and what color it is on Tuesday and what shade it is on Wednesday

[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.440]
Etc. Are in salon

[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.940]
Here's a mobile in sunrise. Hello. Hey me. What's going on? Yes, sir

[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.920]
Can you take any more criticism today? That's it

[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.540]
You showed you show is great. I know what the hell that guy's talking about

[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.320]
But he's right you could use a little bit of a fun tan. Yeah

[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.640]
Maybe I'm sorry. How about some makeup I could have put on during that show?

[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.580]
I like to hear all those other pasty looking people do

[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.340]
You look like Dwight Lorde down. He looks like he looks like Tara. Yeah

[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.040]
Like I know it listen

[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.580]
Next time you go on vacation you got to put a

[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:27.240]
Gotta put the best of neon no chance. It's guys kill him. This guy's killing your audience. Oh, yeah

[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.100]
23 years of buildings gonna kill it in one week. I'm all why is that what is he doing to kill the audience?

[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:37.920]
It's it's uninteresting. There's nothing there. There's no there's no comedy. It's all uh a straight serious talk

[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.360]
About what what are you talking about that was straight?

[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.360]
Heavy issue

[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:47.200]
Straight pubic here. Yeah, you got it. Yeah, yeah

[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.500]
With you know, well, yeah, well, this guy's got pinky pubic here. Okay. I'm sorry

[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.220]
That's one of the things you need to be working on pala straightening out your goddamn pubic here. Oh

[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:03.200]
We have an open line and broward all three and date again as we continue just working working this audience working the room working the crowd

[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.660]
feverishly probing and feeling and squeezing

[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.180]
5 6 7 0 5 6 the they're all critics out there. That's one thing. I love about this stuff

[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:17.400]
They're all critics. They all can do this better. They all look better than I do. They got better complexions et cetera and so on

[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.840]
I got news for I hope for your sake. You look better than I do. I'll tell you that right now

[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.740]
But I've seen many of you and many cases you don't

[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.500]
I've seen lots of you and believe you me you make me look let me say it again like Brad Pitt

[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.340]
And speaking of Brad Pitt, which I mentioned that yesterday the reviews I read about that grotesque

[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.360]
halosha movie

[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.800]
halosha is that another oh

[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.200]
kind of word yes, it is

[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.900]
Joe black deep in the red for struggling universal

[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:49.180]
Meet Joe black has a long way to go to stay out of the red for universal studios. It says

[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:56.000]
Trailing weekend box office lead of the water boy in the strongly opening slasher sequel. I still love what you did last summer

[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.300]
Meet Joe black closed 15 million puke

[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.780]
Pookie dollars for a third place debut pretty weak

[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.020]
The Brad Pitt film is far from recovering its production budget of more than 85 million dollars

[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:16.120]
And the lackluster opening did little to help the hit star of universal now next to last among the major studios in market share

[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.120]
Meet Joe black is a bomb

[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.760]
Maybe lobbamba

[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.820]
With or without Brad Pitt and that's what he brought here

[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.820]
And I do mean phony plot here

[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:33.480]
You know what it looks like Brad Pitt gotta be walking around with bleep spot here when you look that good

[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.880]
Why do you have to start that wouldn't be like him going on getting a nose job. I don't get it

[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.100]
Paula Jones we understand nice job by the way Paula

[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:41.880]
job

[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:48.260]
Monica gave a nice job and she did a nice job. Here's a mobile and four-letter deal. Hello

[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.060]
Hello, yes sir

[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:58.460]
Well public service announcement if you're driving 994 or 994 i95 the Davy Boulevard you're gonna be stuck in traffic

[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.640]
My car wreck is it still all backed up? Yes sir

[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.900]
Didn't know if there are been announced

[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:08.980]
But I just wanted to let everybody know it's still all backed up way way back

[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.100]
Okay, okay, we don't stay in hell thank you sir

[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.880]
They had a five car wreck. I was just wondering about that

[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:20.660]
It must have been a psychic caller there. I was wondering whether I should announce it again because sometime they clear those things up real quick not down here though

[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:27.440]
Five car wreck northbound i95 approaching Davy Boulevard the two left lanes are blocked two cars overturned

[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.840]
It's a mess and there's an hour ago. The ladies were building up all the way to Gryffindrow and like this guy says it's backed up

[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:38.840]
So unless you want to be sitting there and there's nothing there a few things in life more frustrating than sitting in a

[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.760]
middle of a wreck going nowhere

[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.020]
One of the only things worse than that is going to a hockey game and fighting out that there's a god

[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.980]
They have soccer game in the orange ball on the same knife

[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.780]
Anybody remember that?

[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:56.600]
And that there's 80 that they that they scheduled two events downtown on the same night at about the same time

[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.900]
That was real nice, okay

[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.480]
You are Jamaican guys out there was it was it who was it Jamaican and Brazil somebody like that?

[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.880]
Oh, that's right. That's what I got all hostile in neighborhood

[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.720]
Well, you know, I take that soccer ball and

[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:14.900]
All right, but save the good weed now. What am I having for lunch? This is a dilemma. It's already 10 past noon almost

[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.640]
I don't know when you're in the well. Let's have Chuck. Okay. Let's get there. What's your name?

[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.160]
Stacy's balls

[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.220]
Huh? No sauce

[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:31.240]
Okay, I don't want to be know nothing about it because the price is right and the service is great and we love Chuck and we love Nisi but no sauce

[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.080]
I actually had a good day on a scale yesterday. How do you like that?

[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.260]
Under 200 let's hear it. Oh, so like I said, let's lose 37 pounds

[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.120]
So I can be skinny like all the other popular people on TV like Lord Asselin Boy used to be in the J. Lino

[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:53.780]
And that would the renier we used to call him all the time J. Lino. How's really doing by the way? Anybody hear him lately? No, I'm him no more

[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.860]
Here's a mobile in Helen Dale. Hello

[00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.320]
Socks is the

[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.900]
Ball festival for harvest. Yeah, that's it. Well, what does that mean? Well, it's like Thanksgiving

[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.120]
It's a harvest festival. Also, it's a good eating holiday

[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.120]
Sure

[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.220]
Okay, thank you sir. So in other words

[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.240]
Just don't eat the pig or you're definitely burning hell. Oh

[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:23.740]
Yeah, we're gonna be burning in hell on that lake of fire with all these crazy superstitious people need to be locked up and put away for the safety of all the rest of us

[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.000]
please

[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:33.220]
With all their crazy bubble mice these other stories two open lines in Broward counties for the person because I'm trying to think of anybody who doesn't show on TV

[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:38.520]
Male or female that I might have a sexual fantasy about besides Brian Rokross

[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:45.540]
Maybe Candy Corley on CNN speaking to maybe lose two three hundred pounds

[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.540]
See these people have got all these critiques. I hate to break the news to you

[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.720]
But you're looking to people around television if we're in the ones who are very successful

[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:59.300]
And they're all fat in a reengross test whether it's rosy whether it's a rosin whether it's that obnoxious Oprah

[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:03.580]
We'd like to guide them human accordion one day she's 400 the next day she weighs 40 pounds

[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:11.980]
Name me one top-looking person on a talk show on a new show on television one

[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.080]
Could I get back to you? Yeah, get back to me on it Anna

[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.840]
Can't name you one male female indifferent

[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.540]
Which is why people are flipping the channel so much we're desperately looking

[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:33.380]
That's why pens got a little bit of a number there because they had some naked people in every now and then some of them look pretty good

[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.420]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.040]
Maybe I'll go me out. Yes, sir. Welcome back. Did you get to see the

[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.880]
silly picture game last night? I said did you ever think of this

[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.300]
25 one point a lot of times during the game

[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:53.440]
25 to seven players on the ice were the ex-bases. Yeah, that's a draw. I think I saw she and the bees are both played great last night

[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:58.580]
But too bad about that crappy ice again a puck was bouncing around even lies been in the referee were making jokes about it

[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:02.240]
It was pathetic the quality of the ice is so bad and of course in Pittsburgh

[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.380]
There are hundred and three million in debt there on the verge of losing the franchise again

[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.340]
And they probably can't afford to keep that refrigeration going too cold. You know what I'm saying?

[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.340]
Right, but it was amazing when you think about it. I don't want to go back you to that mean well

[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.440]
And what's the point? What's the point you can't live in the past?

[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.520]
That's what they made a million mistakes here. What can I tell you?

[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.180]
25 percent of the players who are on the ice okay, we're gonna say that. Thank you

[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.960]
Okay, we got two calls left in the board. This guy just blew them all off. Thank you very much sir

[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.380]
He keeps saying the same thing over and over again. It's it's aimed. It's boring

[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:35.820]
Thank you history struck a play great last night. I sure as hell wish we had him on the pan through still hell of a player

[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:41.180]
And even with the crappy ice he was the one guy must have the must have had the right blades on his skates last night or something

[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:47.200]
He was smoking he was flying up and back in and out all over the goddamn place nice going Marty. There's a real player for you

[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:52.640]
But you know just sitting here and whining and crying about the same spilt milk over and over again

[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.680]
You argue a Sunday the fires will be here. There'll be the visa. We had that woman to call up yesterday

[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.700]
She's gonna be there Sunday rooting for the visa. What kind of a fan is that?

[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:08.320]
What kind of a fan is that? I mean, I like the visa. Okay. He gave us a lot of good games never stole a freight train

[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.700]
He's got a great relationship with God

[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:16.840]
But you know, so what's the big deal? I'm gonna root against us because the visa is gonna be

[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.160]
I hope we score 10 goals on a filly on Sunday

[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.200]
Shocked a hell out of everybody

[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:29.360]
She's gonna be there rooting for the visa. You know people. I just want to go and and have a lot of spite and well

[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:36.480]
What's the point that would be like my bringing at no B.M. Side of the arena on Sunday. Am I gonna be doing that? Uh-huh just like

[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:43.320]
If that sound guy acts up again, I never talked about that the fact that that asshole sound guy was the one that played that

[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:48.700]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, he was going responsible for that abhorrent act and got into a lot that a lot of trouble about it

[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:54.040]
What's his name? Dave star. Yeah, who used to work here by the way and got canned so they tell me because he was not too great

[00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:00.540]
Yeah, but I'm not even that good you divorced an ad

[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:06.000]
Two open lines in date county five six seven oh five sixty but that's one or four forty one and I was very

[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.540]
Wrote with the best sums in the history of the human race and great meets and great all kinds of stuff and great people too by the way

[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.640]

[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:21.920]

[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.900]
Southwest Florida

[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:38.720]
Well, you talk about how you're really in song are we are what are you talking about naples? I don't live in naples

[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.780]
I live in South Florida southeast Florida the gold code the old coast

[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:47.560]
I don't know I just think you're a little too hard on the

[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.480]
I'm too hard now you get a personal suraction

[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:57.120]
How do we go down here you're from down here? Yeah, and then you're happy about what's happening to this town

[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:02.880]
You like the way things are here now? Oh like everything. Well, not that bad compared to what?

[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.440]
Oh compared to Farge of Nevada compared to where?

[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.280]
Get this guy a map in a compass. Okay another dummy. Oh

[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.740]
Farge of Nevada

[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.260]
We're in southwest Florida. I'm always complaining about sir

[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:23.220]
I'm gonna tell you something you're a perfect example of why some of us are pissed off about down here

[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:29.820]
If you could tell stupidity by the outman be billionaire. We could retire midnight tonight

[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:38.120]
Perocchio dumb people and never got out of the guy then who think the whose idea of a big great trip a hot vacation

[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.700]
Is a trip to singar Island

[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.840]
That's their idea of a wild time in the old town

[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:50.900]
And you know and you know this is the sad part about it most Americans you give them a map and you say okay point out in New York state

[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:56.660]
The point out Florida even people who live in Florida. They can't find it and on the map either

[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:03.420]
Just to look at something on the map that looks like you're shlawing okay. It's drooping down there. There it is

[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.460]
That's Florida. Okay, it's drooping

[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:13.760]
And of course every time Florida takes a yeah shoots off another one. There's a little Caribbean islands down it. That's right

[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:21.180]
Just like say lawn or shrewy Lanka or whatever it is India took a big dump and there it came that little turret of an island down there

[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.040]
Of all those 10th world people

[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:29.000]
We have an open line and Dave one in India still has the number one movie industry in the world. Are you aware of that?

[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:34.120]
I ever heard that I watched Donna. Hey, they got a very big thing over there. I'm glad that I mentioned that they have a

[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.240]
Moon movie about two lesbians

[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.260]
Yeah, in India and well very

[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.780]
Totally unanswered what?

[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.200]
They got that comma sutra. They're big of the sex

[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:49.340]
It's not like that. They're not saying that they're not big in the sex, but they're quite surprised that for them

[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:54.500]
This is the first time there's been a even public recognition of female homosexuality

[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:58.140]
And they have a big guy dyke movie going on over there in India. So let's hear it for the Indians

[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:04.120]
Chamo Ramar whatever his name was the Indian boy on the elephant remember that on the Andy divine show before you were born course not

[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.500]
What how can we get a copy of that movie?

[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.260]
And you remember when on a bus to brown show he used to say talk your magic twang or froggy

[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.500]
Now you can't if you said that on the year today go straight to jail. Okay. That's the way it isn't America today

[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.620]
Industry parts of society we got what?

[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:23.400]
Sabled the Indian boy. Yeah, we used to ride on the elephant. He blew all his money on booze by the way

[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:24.600]
He did?

[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:32.440]
Two stories got a lot of money for the couple of movies he made and uh, direct it all but I thought he was an Indian boy from India not from not from

[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:34.600]
Eccalaureate or somewhere

[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:41.440]
I'm Tony those Canadian Indian guys. They got a big alcohol problem. I'm not not getting money to understand

[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.900]
What do you think they got what do you think?

[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.980]
Molson's is making all that money up there in LeBat

[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:51.540]
LeBat's making so goddamn much money. They were able to buy out hockey night in Canada from Molson because all those Indians up there

[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.080]
I got those long cold nights

[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:56.920]
That's right

[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.020]
Gold leaf skull baby. Oh, then the caps tonight

[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.680]
Now we're talking some serious crap

[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.600]
26 past known as QA

[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.540]
Better ask your fellow courtman, Angela Pai

[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:35.640]
With some day, even if you're a guy 1231 at 560 WQN

[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.140]
We have two open lines and date

[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:40.740]
You know that guy that called a minute ago they got to need to accomplish in a road map that

[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.660]
Functionally a literate human being or excuse for one. That's some leave thereof

[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.680]
I'd like to know what it is that I say about this town

[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.560]
What is it that I express about the way businesses done here or any other comments?

[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:56.740]
I have about the way people drive here the way they're intolerant to each other about the politics

[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.840]
What is it I said I say that's wrong

[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:06.680]
I'm always hearing that well if you don't like it so much why'd you go someplace else well because I don't feel like it okay because I'm making out here okay

[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:11.640]
Even in spite of the stress level in fact, maybe I thrive on it. Maybe I'm a masochist

[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:19.860]
But I'd like to I'd like for somebody to tell me what it is that I exaggerate about is there anybody out there that believes that the way

[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:25.700]
Business is done in this town is the way it is any place else in America. No any other civilized play. No way Jose

[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:31.120]
But I'm open to suggestion okay. I'm sitting here. I will listen very

[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.720]
patiently to any other illiterate guys like him

[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.980]
Or they're pulled like girlfriends and wives. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello

[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.140]
Hi, how are you doing? Is anybody okay sir?

[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:47.280]
Good. I was calling in regards to you asking if there are any talk shows that look quite attractive

[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:54.240]
Yes, not that they're super models, but I think leaves the gigans and Maria Osman are quite attractive Maria Osman

[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.180]
Yeah, I think so

[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:57.360]
Okay

[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.780]
Lisa's okay. Yeah, I just don't like the way she says Lisa

[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:08.400]
Oh that in the lipstick gotta go. Mm-hmm. Uh, that's it. Just going to know forget about Ricky Lake

[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.720]

Okay, we're sick and tired all his belly. I can't tell him what the way it is

[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:25.240]
Let's just straighten his ass out here today while he's in the middle of a great lunch from Chuck's sub center

[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.160]
Meet balls and cheese and onions. Thank you. Thanks, Nisi

[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.140]

I could actually give you the hours, but the you don't want to hear about it

[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:46.800]
Here's a mobile and poor lotterdale. Hello. Hey long time second time caller. All right Neil

[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:53.420]
How about am gigante? She's pretty sweet. Ham gigante? Right who is that?

[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:59.100]
All channel seven out of watch channel seven. Oh, she's a good looking little lady. She is sweet as Brian Andrews

[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.900]
Probably not that's wait. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. Are we gonna go through this now? I'm so sorry I asked that question

[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:12.040]
Open line and Broward all day five six seven oh five sixty. I should probably play some music so I can enjoy my lunch and piece, you know

[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.960]
All seriously they got nothing to say now. I asked some very, you know, I put them on the spot

[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.080]
I

[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:24.920]
And invited them to call and tell me where I'm wrong. They just don't have the courage of their condition

[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:29.720]
Oh, he's too negative that god damn bag Neil. He you know he tells us the way he sees it

[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:35.780]
We love everything about this time. We like to fix elections. We like the god damn make illegal aliens driving on the road

[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.000]
We like all this crap. Come on. Let's hear it

[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.840]
We may have it a good time like magic Johnson man

[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:49.640]
I'm so good on my god damn meatballs

[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.200]
Don't forget the cheese buddy

[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.540]
That you know something that is the worst sounding piece of crap in the history of the human race

[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:09.060]
26 years ago now there's something that should have been left in the dustbin of musical oblivion

[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:16.160]
And here we are 25 or 26 years later while Gary Glitter is fighting these pedophilia charges or whatever it is

[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.460]
And and their plan is that every god damn sporting of it is if this is some kind of a great recording

[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:26.540]
Wouldn't you rather hear like Motown at a ballgame

[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:33.400]
Anybody I'm just just for example if you're gonna take old music from the 70s

[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:38.620]
Or how about the beast boys? How about fun fun fun? How about something you know

[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:43.740]
That'll get the crowd going a little bit, but something that you might want to hear again someday as opposed to

[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:50.100]
It's next out and all the music is sour it's just goaded as thick as it's crap

[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:52.080]
Hey

[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:58.140]
Oh my god all that glitters is old make no mistake about it

[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.040]

Blinkville Hills. How ride okay?

[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.200]
We used to go on the weekends you'd go up the canter because drinking a beer there you go

[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:22.560]
That's why I was just making a comment about most of the guys over there drunk anyways right that's right

[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.460]
I just take it you gotta be to look to those long cold winners, baby

[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:32.680]
Go see on the peace bridge the ambassador bridge there you go. Okay, see on the s-ill for Expressway

[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.880]
Maybe oh there's nothing like Detroit used to be

[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.420]
Anybody here dick Burton call me the other day no

[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.000]
Well, that was that was the highlight of my birthday hearing from dick Burton

[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:46.280]
We have two open lines in brodered five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line

[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:51.160]
Let's get with it. Let's hear about it all the good things about son for to let's be more positive here

[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:56.960]
Anybody want to do that? No, let's get with it now that guy had a great point even though he didn't know where the hell

[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.160]
He was on the math on the earth on the globe

[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:06.880]
Yeah, I mean you talk about education system in America that that's an I see more on American education. There's no such thing

[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:12.580]
People I can't even look on a goddamn math and know which state like where is Missouri on the map, huh?

[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.740]
Missouri what the hell is that

[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.400]
It's the show me state ain't it? Isn't Missouri the show me state? Please say it is yes

[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:24.580]
Well show me on a map where goddamn misery is all care find out well

[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.960]
Maybe a city like besides St. Louis in Missouri, huh?

[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.020]
Maybe one besides Kansas City the one that's not in Kansas

[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.880]
Here's a mobile and Wilton manners hello

[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:37.240]
Hey, they all have a guy great you're gonna think I'm a freak

[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:45.000]
But uh, you know when you're free to me, huh? You know when Russell is on CNN. I used to work with little Russell at WKAT

[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.920]
She used to be my program director. I think that she is L T so after

[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:56.900]
She's getting pretty old. I hate to break the news, but she's like 50, but I think she's well preserved. She's very well preserved. You're right

[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:03.540]
Can I call for me a douchebag? Go ahead George Cory you are a douche bag and you are right you are free

[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.660]
Kevin Rayte for up. Okay. We have an open line. I mean the Glenn Russell

[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.800]
But that's the way guys are I mean they're a lot of sexual guys and there are a lot of fags too

[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.240]
I mean they don't really care what it's connected to a face here

[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:19.560]
That gets him that's enough for them and guys they see all I have to just get that sniff in here and right away

[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.040]
They're like turned out. They're like a like a flagpole baby

[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:27.500]
I mean you have you can be whatever you want to be. It's a free world to a point

[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:31.060]
But Jesus Christ try to be a little bit discriminating will you?

[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:34.900]
People that get all-hunting bothered about very very marginal people

[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.080]
About people that you wouldn't touch with somebody else's hand

[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.840]
Like Paul Castro noble by the way he'll be on channel 10 tonight

[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:47.520]
What when you're lab? I'm trying to promote that thing for them. Okay my close personal friend Diane Magnum

[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.680]
Who by the way happens to be a real sweetheart? She's really nice. I love you at Diane

[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.800]
She's a real nice person. That's the first time I ever met her. She's great

[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.700]
And maybe that'll make the piece better that they do it on me tomorrow night 11 o'clock on channel 10

[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.080]
No, she knows I don't watch channel 10 news, but at least this time we're watching

[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.060]
Park Astor Nova is gonna be on there tonight. I'll be at the track. Sorry Paul

[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.760]
I won't be able to hear you talk about how you steal all of us about material

[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.320]
Before he sure did some great things didn't either in his

[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.820]
Yeah, he sure did one or two are really great things in all years. He's been here

[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.320]
21 before one at five six

[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.460]
Q a.m

[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:28.520]
Neil god

[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.160]
MTV presents nine inch nails unplugged

[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.700]
I want to you like

[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:50.260]
It's not on

[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.200]
How come this isn't working

[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.220]
You knocked over my bonge

[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:10.960]
Nine inch nails I'm club only on MTV 1245 at five sixty WQ and I take back what I said before

[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.960]
I did finally think of a news person who I think is very very very very very good looking and of course

[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.260]
Most of you guys would agree because you're probably straight

[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.020]
Bill Hummer on CNN

[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:27.080]
Hammer Hummer I call him Bill Hummer. You don't of course you know who he is he's on in the morning doing the news on CNN every morning

[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:32.900]
Bill Hummer with the glasses when he takes the glasses off he really looks great and he puts him back on his Clark Ken

[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:37.840]
And then when he sits in that funny little cheer with a wheels on it then he's a Christopher Reeve

[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.380]
Oh, thank God I haven't played that thing in a long time huh very poor taste

[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.980]
Two open lines in that what's wrong with Bill Hummer?

[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.840]
There we go. I'd like to see him make it to open online look at this

[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.320]
I'm telling you man like I said before it's hopeless

[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:55.980]
Every line in the board was lit up you go in one of those goddamn long ponder's breaks and you come back

[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.260]
There is just not the dedication anymore

[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:04.480]
You know we can blame the management here and these greedy salespeople and school and and this one in that one

[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.760]
But the fact is that it's the audience out there

[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:11.640]
Like they got something important going on in your lives. Which do we believe that? No, of course not

[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:18.100]
But they just don't that they haven't made the commitment as Jesse Jackson would say you've been having to make the commitment

[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:22.020]
And you just do I be willing to do it God damn it

[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.640]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello

[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.220]
Hi

[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:31.340]
What is it Neil yes sir come on I'm hanging in there. It's been about an hour

[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:37.660]
11 a minute and 36 seconds anyway first of all I'm from Western North Miami Beach

[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:43.660]
He used to be from Las Vegas North Dakota. Uh-huh. That was a real pretty. Yeah, that's right next to Binghamton, Iowa. Yeah

[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:44.500]
um

[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:52.200]
I love you. I think you're wonderful and I've got to be a freak because I think leader rascal is way

[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:57.080]
Really is very deceptive though. You have to like she's pretty scrummy well

[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:01.140]
If they ever saw her in person is she she appears like she's really fallen

[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:05.240]
If he's tall and scrum or if he's not built at all she's got very scrum

[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:09.920]
Oh my god. She used to be married to Jim Dunlap by the way used to work on a station back in the rocket world

[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.920]
As she was married to uh this job. I'm hard work

[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:20.460]
You know that she is not like I said she's like a like a water melon and she's the hottest thing going. Oh my god

[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.980]
She makes Pamela Lee look like

[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:27.780]
Minotaurist well. I love you. I enjoy the show. I'll wait forever. Okay. All right

[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:28.400]
Well

[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.020]
Till wait forever for Lynn Russell. Oh

[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:38.200]
You're about Lynn Russell in Jim Altman WKAT. Let's hear from some of the old KAT listeners. Are we want to hear from them? Oh, they're all dead

[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:44.580]
Two open lines and date one and powered five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line

[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:51.240]
I'm still waiting. I gave you an open invitation. I gave you a blank check boys and girls that guy that one very

[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.860]
Articular guy who didn't know his ass from the math

[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:59.240]
He had a very good point that is on two god damn negative. He's from here

[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:04.360]
And he resents the fact that I'm so critical of so many that god damn unacceptable things down here

[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:09.680]
And I want you to tell me where I'm wrong. I want to be steered in the right goddamn erection, okay

[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:17.680]
Unlike Don I'm obsessed with that bum steer. I'm I'm serious if he don't stop talking about his wife and little baby

[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:21.980]
You know, what what is the new thing now in the 90s old farts heaven kids little kids

[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:27.500]
Have you noticed this 20 Martin? I think there's the one who started it. I'm not Tony martini randall and

[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:33.320]
And I like Tony randall Tony randall is a good liberal. He's my kind of guy is a great guy

[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:37.660]
And he's a funny guy, but he's a hundred years old. He keeps making little babies for Christ's sake

[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.900]
And I don't I'm a who makes Tony randall look like a teenager. He's got this little kid

[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.960]
And all he does is talk about his little kid and his wife and about the Fred on the farm

[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:58.060]
And who had the calf out there and which kind of was the whole steam and a Bernstein for whatever he's talking about and this guy's making millions and millions of dollars and you talk about looking bad on television

[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.500]
Like I said yesterday. This is a dead man in a chair

[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.540]
a dead man

[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:10.880]
And yes, he does have a lot of if you ever watched it on MSNBC and you see he's got he's got the news guy

[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:15.540]
Who's going all the facial here now who is he's a good news guy is okay, but he adds nothing

[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:18.080]
He adds nothing to the show. He has nothing to say

[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.880]
And he just he just keeps sucking around and calling him i-man all the time

[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.260]
But he has nothing to say then he's got the board off who every now and then opens up a post

[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:29.200]
And he's got some other guy sitting in the back there which I know I and then there's also the sports guy

[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.220]
They got about a half a dozen people on that show

[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:37.040]
And he still looks like a dead man in a chair and he's still all in all the media types then rather

[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.980]
I mean every single one of them

[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:44.580]
Because all of us said my miss instead of being funny like he used to be he came a political curmudgeon

[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.980]
A little too far to the right for most of us but nevertheless a political curmudgeon

[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:54.780]
And so now all of a sudden he's the darling of the of the media based on what I have no idea unless they all like a vulture

[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.080]
Mobile in the key. So hello

[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:04.840]
Hey Neil how are you? Great. Hey listen out there was one reporter that was so good looking

[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:09.720]
I became a channel 10 news convert but she hasn't been on a month. I can't remember her name. She was a tall

[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.960]
Then we're in that short hair look like she was half with you know half angle

[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:19.700]
I'm not a squeal or just yeah, but they must have to ship right here. She was too good looking

[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.560]
Uh, I'm a

[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:28.920]
Is I thought was the ugliest man in America and he is a skeleton in the chair, but web hubble makes him look like Brad Pitt

[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.840]
Yeah, but web hubble don't have a TV show

[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:35.140]
Wow, and I don't think we still get stuck seeing him when he's in the nose. So

[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.700]
One more good looking news report on the NBC does the DC reports is

[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.180]

[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.740]
So it could be a friend. Okay, see you

Happy circus to all the goyam in the audience by the way. I love that thing. I'm CNN around the BBC

With that is really won't said America just leave us alone. Don't interfere. Okay, you're goyam. That was nice nice going sweetheart

[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:04.560]
It was so I actually got sexual excitement from hearing somebody else and in the media use the word goyam

[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.220]
I mean, I just

[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:07.520]

[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:12.680]
In fact wait wait till they start talking using the word sparts are on you then I'm ready to get excited

[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.720]

By the way, I'm in section 101 that lady you called yesterday that wants to come by and stuck around on Sunday

[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:57.520]
I said 106 because it's uh, you know habit. Of course, I have it used to be 106 in the order enough

[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.520]

Or he want to ask for a date is that who that was?

[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.520]

[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.380]
Send a picture pal. I'll let you know. I'm pretty busy right now

[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:16.240]
We have an open-minded brother at 567 line. Do you believe that I'm pretty busy? No, of course not

[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:19.480]
Not here. Here's a mobile in high alia. Hello

[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.660]
Neil. Yes, sir

[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:21.740]
Independence

[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.040]
You want another pound in Missouri? Yeah

[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:33.300]
Independence in Missouri. Yeah, didn't know where Harry Truman was from? That's exactly where Harry Truman was brought. What a genius I am, huh? Give him a hell of Harry

[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:33.960]
Right

[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:39.940]
They somebody out here does know geography. Harry wouldn't screw around with sad about that boy. He'd bomb him into the Stone Age

[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.040]
All like you wouldn't believe bring back Harry

[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:47.080]
Not from the home of Harry. No, he's black. Tim. He ticked Monica's out of the office. That's right

[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:53.920]
We bring back Harry. Do you ever see best Truman by the way? Oh my god. He was she made she made the

[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:59.620]
Sandy Crowley or whatever her name is from most CNN look like a midget. She must have weighed 600 pounds easy

[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.040]
That's that big I thought she was the okay

[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:08.720]
Bring back herium. What's the oh and Zull sleeping dogs lie including Margaret is Margaret Truman still alive? Do we know? No

[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.040]
Open-line a day one in broad in piano though that Margaret

[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:17.780]
Let's bring back all the old days head Sullivan show come on. Let's go back to her in a clock bag

[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:22.600]
To when we had good time when we had realistic TV on air like Aussie and Harriet

[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:25.040]
And father of being no one the best

[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.380]
and all they and

[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.740]
What was his name the great gilder sleep. Let's bring back all of those shows where nobody ever went to work every day

[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:38.260]
See on the soap opera is now. It's very realistic because every soap opera they hang out most of the time in the hospital

[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.680]
We even got one called general hospital and we used to have one called the doctors

[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:46.300]
Which went off the air because now what's it in they used to play alphia?

[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:50.880]
She's busy on that other show before guiding light another whatever it is as the world of the warm turns

[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:56.140]
She used to be alphia on the doctors, but even if it's not a show called the hospital

[00:51:56.140 --> 00:52:00.020]
They spent all their time in the hospital close by to the hospital

[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.160]
They got tubes in their nose tubes in their rectum all over the place

[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.280]
Because you got to have a lot of tourists to keep the soap opera people happy

[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:13.000]
We have an open-line in power now the first suggestion here about how I'm wrong about South Florida

[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:18.660]
I shouldn't know when a guy started talking about how I live in southwestern Florida and then bringing Naples into the equation

[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:21.000]
What that was at all about is anybody know no

[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.980]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello

Very good sir very well so far up to this moment

[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:34.460]
That's good. I well sometimes I think you don't go far enough when you're complaining

[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:38.680]
There's so much other things that are wrong here. Well go ahead. Lay it on me. I'm eating lunch. Go ahead

[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:45.180]
I hate the fact that I was I because I was brought up very respectful and very generous to people and I always say excuse me

[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:45.740]
Thank you

[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.580]
Even when you just let someone pull out front of you they don't end you be like and you can be a man

[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.000]
Right

[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.240]
You know

[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.960]
Always do that. I always give a little wave a little thing and

[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:05.100]
Knowledge it's another one of those ways of being pleasant and I open the door and they don't say thank you

[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:09.180]
I'll make sure they hear me say you're welcome. Uh-huh. Yeah, just people are still there

[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:12.460]
Right and I love you now and God bless and back to you

[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:17.340]
Okay, see there the guy is right. I haven't even scratched the surface yet. So starting tomorrow

[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.940]
We're going to be doing a series of 75,000 shows in a row on which we bitching grape and carry on about every goddamn thing

[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:26.620]
That's wrong in his style. All right

[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:32.900]
And we can thank that guy that boy that called before who's still looking for it on the map

[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:40.460]
I'm sorry. I mean maybe I'm just uh, I'm not so smart believe me. I was so smart. I wouldn't be here

[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:45.760]
But when I think about the average truck out there that can't even find a place on a map

[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:53.180]
God, I mean forget about a country like that guy to call the other day talking about wasn't I worried about all the stuff going on in

[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.520]
Iraq when I was in Amsterdam?

[00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:00.660]
Have you ever looked on a map and seen how far uh Amsterdam is from Iraq?

[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:07.560]
Huh, I mean I've seen a racquetoo in Amsterdam mostly in those windows

[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.380]
seen lots of rags

[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:16.420]
Many of them very ugly by the way, but there's also for a some very attractive young ladies knows windows

[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:17.660]

More power to him. Yeah, just not for me

[00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:38.690]
Well, I'm not saying it's for you. It's not for me either. Okay, so there's something we're sharing common

[00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:44.710]
And I'll tell you this much anybody who goes to Amsterdam has to pay for sex there other than alcohol

[00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:48.110]
Thing which we can understand that very easily, but anybody besides him

[00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:52.250]
I mean, I don't get that at all. I don't understand it

[00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:54.850]

You know, there's this guy, but I know they met at your place. You heard this guy. What is his name? The met at your place

[00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:58.450]

Some kind of a spict to me exactly. Yeah, the assistant superintendent for the county public schools. Yeah

[00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:08.230]
If Nick Neil you got to listen for here this guy speak English

Unfor-lea-war. How can a guy like this without position no higher? No spitting ways. Oh man

[00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:20.410]
I wish I got a tape it and call you back so you could freaking freak out. Yeah, I mean that so I could freaking Frank

[00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:24.850]
And and you'll be being under radio is certain things. He's just unexplainable

[00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:31.830]
You know, I just you got the girl they think just astonishes me. He might he must have the drawers full of naked pictures

[00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:37.110]
And I think I think he's got the whole the b-rees with the sheep collection. I think he's got those

[00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:41.590]
This guy besides being the assistant superintendent for the county public schools

[00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:44.730]
Yeah, he also punched private schools in Bay County

[00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:48.770]
By the name of I think the name of the schools are Jose Matatine school

[00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:50.630]
And he comes the best part

[00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:55.030]
Now they're saying that the guy is using the public school books in his schools

[00:56:56.570 --> 00:57:01.250]
How do you like that? What does that mean? You know the schools that they use for public schools in public schools

[00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:05.410]
Yeah, he's using those books in his schools in his private schools

[00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:08.370]
Well, what did I have? Ain't costing him a dime probably. Why is the other words?

[00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:12.690]
He's appropriating them from the public schools. That was your saying right exactly grown unbelievable

[00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:18.350]
Neil can you play two quick things for me that I love when you put them on the lady the girl that says it's the American effort way

[00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:24.810]
And that's the American way yeah, and also the the lady says oh my god

[00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:29.710]
Now you mean the one that drive the old lady. Oh my god. Oh, man

[00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:33.710]
It makes my Johnson stretch when I listen to that. Okay, pal. Thanks. Joe. I have another dream

[00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:38.430]
He's dreaming he's stretching it. We have an open line in the date, but what was he talking about?

[00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:41.810]
The Nicario that is Paris Paris

[00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:45.470]
You see one thing. I let me just tell you this about Hispanics

[00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:50.370]
And that is the Hispanic men although I listen to the women do it to some of them

[00:57:50.370 --> 00:57:53.590]
I guess they're just doing it to try to act bouches well. Maybe that's a message or signal

[00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:58.310]
But the the rolling of the R is very definitely a macho thing

[00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:01.490]
It's part of that whole machismo mentality of Hispanic men

[00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:03.950]
And the more like if you say Joe

[00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:08.370]
Royo if you can really roll it if you can dig down deep

[00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:11.130]
Cario, but it's only a single R

[00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:13.010]
You're not supposed to roll it

[00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:20.170]
You're not supposed to roll it. That's not what they say in this neighborhood. Yeah, well anything you get your hands on

[00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:24.590]
That doesn't make it well. They always say that though Joe

[00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:29.270]
Cario you well, no, it's not just me everybody calls him Joe Cario

[00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:32.550]
That's the nicest thing they call him all right. So what's the word with two ours?

[00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:33.730]
Perl like dog

[00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:35.930]
Borrero

[00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:42.770]
That's it. Borrero. I do I do that very well. I do my rs extremely well. Almost like a real macho guy

[00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:43.990]
Borrero

[00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:50.030]
Stop that for yeah for old you for a fag and then there's always

[00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:54.770]
Orlando like to roll him right out on the carpet

[00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:59.650]
Haven't seen him in a long time. You don't wonder whatever happened to him. Maybe you'll have to bring a stevey bowler back

[00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:07.450]
Just so we find a Orlando again. Here's my new beach. Hello. Hey, Neil. What's up? Hey, don't sir. Yeah, you sound like you just

[00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:10.910]
Brazen. Yeah, it's a Julio here in the beach

[00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:14.710]
I got a lot of Jewish friends so I picked it up throughout the years

[00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:22.870]
I know that the guy from the Spokane is the group with a gang right the whole family. Yeah, uh-huh

[00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:28.270]
Okay, we have an open line in date five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the

[00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:29.850]
18 T wireless line

[00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:34.890]
That's what Bubba said the sucker the sucker's all nobody said something like that

[00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:38.150]
The not the mishpuffer it all ties in together

[00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:44.070]
You know since September I've been taught. Let's hope he's not eaten too much over there. Oh god almighty

[00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:47.710]
Here's a mobile in poppano hello

[00:59:48.570 --> 00:59:52.570]
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Well, I'm in sunrise now. There's a sunrise

[00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:55.670]
Just want to let you know it's not from Hong Kong

[00:59:56.870 --> 01:00:02.110]
19 hours of flying Jesus Christ and the economy class of the 747

[01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:08.930]
Yeah, five hours from Miami to San Francisco four hour over the line 19 hours you flew in schlepper class

[01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:14.550]
I went five hours from Miami to San Francisco. Yeah, I had a four hour overway

[01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:20.610]
Fourteen hours to Hong Kong. Yeah in economy. Was it we're heading for to do things?

[01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:26.270]
Yeah, and I'll tell you what the best view I had there in 10 days

[01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:27.390]
Ruth's Chris

[01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:28.490]
How do you want that?

[01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:37.710]
Unbelievable. I thought that I said that's where I'm going to be all right. There you go the other thing that's looking woman on TV. I'll reach your table

[01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:42.070]
Got it. I'll take your word for it. Okay. Welcome back. Good luck, you sir

[01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:48.110]
Now, that's interesting because he was talking about I brought that up a couple of times on here and again because I'm dealing with so many

[01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:50.510]
Perocule people down here who never get like out of town

[01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:53.530]
Uh, it's not a figment of my imagination

[01:00:53.530 --> 01:01:01.070]
Has nothing to do with people who don't bathe it has to do with skin pigmentation and people in different parts of the world have different body odor

[01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:08.190]
Not all of them, but many of them people from the Middle East people from India people from the Far East people

[01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.010]
Many of them

[01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:15.210]
And of course it raises the question what do a white people smell like to them?

[01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:18.690]
What do black people smell like?

[01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:21.430]
To them

[01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:25.810]
We have an open line and date one and breath

[01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:31.670]
No, you see you were one of the people I can't give me a bunch of crap about it has to do with people not taking a bath

[01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:38.030]
That's not what this subject is about it has to do with the fact that people in different parts of the world have different

[01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:40.250]
Skin pigmentation and they smell different

[01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:44.990]
And if you're one of them you smell fine. You don't uh, I get I would assume

[01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:49.090]
White people think to the asians that well, that was my point

[01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:54.890]
All right, the reason we're having such a bad problem with the Isis these guys and buildings they making a two-page for hockey arenas

[01:01:55.490 --> 01:02:00.830]
Uh, they have the same problem in Boston and state problem in Chicago. Yeah, the newer readers are where they have an worst problem

[01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:06.270]
But what about Pittsburgh? That's not a new arena that I sterilized that was the was some of the worst I've ever seen in my life

[01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:08.530]
The puck was dribbling like a goddamn volleyball

[01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:12.810]
Well, that's because nobody has a brain to set their status up any higher up in Pittsburgh

[01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:16.730]
Most of them try to stay on electric up there too because they can't pay the bills

[01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:17.390]
Yeah

[01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:19.710]
You've got to save the

[01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:23.870]
Success if your maple leaves right now because I don't think that's gonna

[01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:28.890]
Hold on for very long. Well, I mean, yeah, you never know who now knows they're playing pretty damn good

[01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:32.710]
Of course the only problem is they got home and home next weekend with Buffalo coming up or this weekend

[01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:35.770]
And then you got Boston and Pittsburgh

[01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:38.750]
Yeah, they've never had to deal with them, you know

[01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:41.910]
Year after year. When you're talking about they they split those two with Pittsburgh

[01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:44.310]
They spank the heck out of six to four in the first game

[01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:47.450]
Yeah, but they didn't do two elegance blossom now

[01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:52.350]
One game what a one game doesn't make a lifetime. Yeah, but you know it's gonna happen

[01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:56.770]
Yeah, I do know you're halfway through the year. They're the accordion act. I know lucky for them

[01:02:56.770 --> 01:03:00.990]
They have a very very good goalie and we don't and uh by the way

[01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:03.210]
I want to break the news to you but Curtis Joseph

[01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:08.370]
Hasn't been worth no six million dollars. He hasn't played that great in fact Felix potpan a few games that he's played

[01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:11.790]
He's got a very well one lost record and Curtis Joseph is gone

[01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:18.630]
I'll take pot down over Joseph's panning time. Well, I don't want to be a douchebag. Go ahead. Hey Jimmy go me and you're a douchebag. All right

[01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:23.390]
We have an open line and date one and a guy. It's a hockey guy. Oh, I can't do that. Oh

[01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:24.410]

Were you always uh an Indian or were you like in a previous life were you like from Venus and Uranus

[01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:09.510]
Here's Miramar hello

[01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:12.030]

Going once and have a great life. Yeah, the um, that's another thing not only about geography the Americans really bright

[01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:22.690]
When it comes to homosexuality if I think anything about sexuality at all

[01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:28.250]
They are really right on top of it if I can say that. I mean they got the no clue coolest

[01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:31.890]
Open line and date counties line

[01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:33.710]

Waterdale lakes oh right here. Yes, sir right here

[01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:45.050]
Miss down the first floor. I'm going into a coma here today now just when we build up a little momentum. I'm trying

[01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:48.270]
Um, two things. I want to ask you number one

[01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:50.550]
Which you thought about the plans to

[01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:54.990]
Possibly erect their statue of Wayne. I pinged it down down there

[01:04:54.990 --> 01:05:00.230]
That that evidently came out when I was on vacation. I never heard anything about that. Somebody called about it yesterday

[01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:04.430]
Okay, that was in the paper they're gonna what they want to honor them for some reason

[01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:06.810]
You know, it gives a lot of money to the poor

[01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:10.930]
With something like that. Uh-huh and whether they name the park here

[01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:15.290]
Thanks from the middle class and give it to the poor and like one shade away from Robin

[01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:17.830]
Yeah, he doesn't give much back to believe me

[01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:23.830]
The other thing I got to you is a very very short little poem that I'll help you with your

[01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:30.770]
Hours in Spanish. See and I was taught this I used to teach school up in junean city which had a very high

[01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:35.690]
Cuban immigration and I took it night school for the adults

[01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:41.770]
So one of them took me to soaps to help you with my Spanish and this way goes

[01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:56.610]
Hey, you're new as a Skaterals

[01:05:59.370 --> 01:06:01.950]
Okay, I'll stick with my cigar roll. Yeah, yeah

[01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:05.350]
I'll stick in your heat us. We have an open line in the day one in

[01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:11.450]
Life 670 something old Maribel she didn't last too long as soon as Steve nickel found out that even though she had a great ass

[01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:12.990]
Nobody can miss that once she was talking about

[01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:20.390]
But you didn't have a great ass and you know who else had a great ass and didn't last too long and actually a lesbian. Yeah, her too

[01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:23.490]
Here's a mobile in South Miami. Hello

[01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:29.290]
Hello, new. Yes. How you doing? Okay. All right, listen. Welcome back

[01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:35.830]
What's your name? Welcome back to the water. Yeah. Yeah, and as well as George on your time out. Mm-hmm

[01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:43.290]
It was it was definitely a change of pace, but I feel like it's well infant when you expire or retired

[01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:49.550]
Uh, he'll he'll I'll he'll he'll move right up. Yeah, I'll do well. Uh-huh, and

[01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:54.970]
Right now it's a finger right in the middle of his hand when I went when I went to Spain a couple times

[01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:59.910]
You know, a waiter and a whole bunch of other people came to my table and only one of them

[01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:02.390]
Don't like like what's his name says?

[01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:03.330]
Rimmam

[01:07:03.830 --> 01:07:05.390]
They started and

[01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:10.550]
And oh, that's true because Rimmar said that he was in Paris one time and I asked him how were the French people he said?

[01:07:10.550 --> 01:07:12.530]
They stuck yeah, yeah, and

[01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:17.490]
We all went about the Frenchman up there like you partnered in East-Pafé and he said they stuck yeah

[01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:21.550]
We really asked we asked one of the people who didn't think and we asked them

[01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:25.230]
Who you smell some of these people that really now?

[01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:30.790]
That's a good point now. We now we finally found somebody who understands what I'm talking about and then they said

[01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:32.930]
No, we don't we don't we don't notice

[01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:37.810]
Only one out of the three or four people I came to my table not even at the table

[01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:42.350]
The walking by the table were so pulses so I felt like throwing up

[01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:45.990]
I become a fast-fice I hug my nose and and I was in the back

[01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:51.750]
I'm not surprising when it happens at the restaurant and I knew there's one in the end dude who who's very Americanized and

[01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:56.830]
He used a shower with cologne. So I think if they only put the order and cologne

[01:07:56.830 --> 01:08:01.330]
It won't be so offensive. Okay. All right. We'll spread the word

[01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:03.750]
Oh

[01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:10.490]
Oh cologne rhymes with metacone we have an open line of day to a being again now Jesus Christ

[01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:12.510]
This is my sub from Chuss

[01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:21.410]
Yeah, I mean far be it for me to a critique, but I mean you've been eating non-stop since about 920 this morning

[01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:24.690]
Not that it's only 120 or thereabouts. It's only four hours later

[01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:29.530]
It's all from frustration. It's from working for this company boys and girls

[01:08:29.530 --> 01:08:31.430]
You'll eat your cookies out

[01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:37.750]
We just tear your guts out as they continue to find all odds and all common sense by saying

[01:08:37.750 --> 01:08:39.750]
No matter what the topic is

[01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:43.090]
That's right. That's the a bread-read way

[01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:48.430]
So I wanted with that real story is about those salespeople of making all different kinds of commissions

[01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:54.950]
And people threatening to walk out. Yeah, I will say this. I worked with a lot of screwed-up salespeople in my life as you know

[01:08:56.130 --> 01:09:01.510]
But this sales department is the most volatile. I have ever seen they're hired. They're fired

[01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:05.550]
They're in their route and nobody is gone for like more than five minutes quite frankly

[01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:09.130]
Is there anybody that's gone from well when we started from 11 months ago?

[01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:11.170]
I can't name anybody

[01:09:11.710 --> 01:09:13.750]
They're all still here, but they're here like

[01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:14.770]
temporarily

[01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:20.750]
They're here and then they get fired there. They quit and then they come back and it's just this ongoing

[01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:23.110]
Hostile who is it?

[01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:23.730]
Karina

[01:09:24.610 --> 01:09:26.790]
Karina Karina by Ray Peterson. I remember that

[01:09:27.490 --> 01:09:31.350]
He didn't smell too good to open lines. Indeed five real good was Pat Peterson

[01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:34.930]
How does that pat Peterson do when I'm not finding anybody seeing him lately? No

[01:09:36.570 --> 01:09:39.630]
Haven't heard from her in a long time boy you talk about being abandoned

[01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:44.450]
What is it about three four months since we heard from the not-slanding lady and I've even gone out of my way and beg

[01:09:45.690 --> 01:09:48.130]
I beg for what he grraver we got what he grraver

[01:09:48.130 --> 01:09:53.130]
I beg for easy, which is a bad mistake. We finally got Izzy on the goddamn phone. Incoherent as he was

[01:09:55.170 --> 01:09:59.750]
Well, even Sandy remember that we got Sandy that one time which it'll probably never happen again

[01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:06.350]
But our good post personal friend the not-slanding lady that I made famous into a superstar helped her lose all that weight

[01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:10.770]
Changed her life saves her life and we heard from her in a coon's age. Oh, no

[01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:17.090]
Boy, not that I'm bitter. I want you to understand that not bitter about it

[01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:19.130]
I'd you go home and cry a lot

[01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:21.630]
You want the fennel?

[01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:28.550]
This is the most disgusting program. I urge everyone to complain to this station

[01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:30.050]
Coming soon

[01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:37.550]

[01:10:40.230 --> 01:10:44.150]
Crack show on channel 10 where they hit 500 people on it. It was either for like two minutes

[01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:49.990]

[01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:53.370]
Great guy tremendous athlete a superstar

[01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:57.390]
Seems like a great kid and is anybody talk about him here? No

[01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:02.430]
We hear lots about Jose Can Succo who's a role model like I'm a rocket scientist

[01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:08.410]
Okay, and then of course, you know if the strictly a Cuban thing if Alice Rodriguez were Cuban

[01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:13.430]
His picture would be on the front page of the hero on the front session not this sports section on the front session

[01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:15.270]
Right next to the mass head every day

[01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:20.630]
But he's not doesn't he like from Malorid public opinion to Connor somewhere like that

[01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:24.430]
Well, he's got some god damn nerve him and Sammy Sosa

We have all three lines in dead county are open five six seven oh five six the pond five six the on the 18 to wireless line

[01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:46.230]
Do they know from Alex Rodriguez in dead county? No, of course not

[01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:48.870]
He's from the wrong uh neck of the woods

[01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:52.450]
Did it make you warm in here is it me maybe it was that lunch? Huh?

[01:12:52.690 --> 01:12:56.070]
Did you get more and I noticed by the way? That's another great thing about not having the tv crew

[01:12:56.070 --> 01:13:00.090]
I don't want them to feel bad because they'll take it personally. We still love them and miss them etc

[01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:05.130]
You believe it but uh, it isn't nice how the temperature pretty much stays the same all the time now

[01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:07.230]
Have you noticed that?

[01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:09.250]
Uh-huh

[01:13:10.290 --> 01:13:14.310]
Here's the pepper primes hello hello meal. Yes. Uh, yeah

[01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:20.650]
I wouldn't ask you a question. We were both an argument about hockey and I figured uh, I'd ask you since you're pretty knowledgeable about the subject

[01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:25.130]
No, I'm not knowledgeable on an expert. Oh, well. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I do

[01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:27.670]
Um, my brother still thinks

[01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:33.510]
That uh now that Dallas's picked up Brett holes are gonna win the west over Detroit and my opinion is Detroit

[01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:34.690]
So I wasn't lost anybody

[01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:38.730]
Detroit's not playing that good right now of course, they you know, sometimes they start out slow

[01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:44.450]
But they're not playing too good now, but am I arguing that to him was that uh, that Detroit still has all the top name players

[01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:49.310]
They still got you know, I mean everybody they've all on two for the past two seasons that they won the championship

[01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:52.930]
Now the problem that Dallas has got is they're never gonna win the uh champion

[01:13:52.930 --> 01:13:56.230]
They never really win the Stanley Cup with Eddie a balfour and then that's never happened

[01:13:56.830 --> 01:14:00.570]
That's true investor. Maybe they can trade for a partner or something. Yeah

[01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:03.010]
No, no way because balfurs make an affortune

[01:14:04.150 --> 01:14:09.250]
They got a gigantic payroll and I can't show them a question of how is the how they gonna deal the way

[01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:12.550]
Pots and if they don't want to get another goalie from they want to get somebody else

[01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:15.790]
How they gonna deal that a lot of they have to have a backup goalie and in the deal

[01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:20.890]
But they I have no idea. I mean when the Montreal traded T-votor Chicago for a hack it two days ago

[01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:23.470]
Oh, that shocked me because the word to continue to be that

[01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:25.370]
Pop that was going to Montreal didn't happen

[01:14:26.190 --> 01:14:29.630]
So I have no but in the meantime he keeps playing you know every like that

[01:14:29.630 --> 01:14:33.810]
We have an open line and Broward to endade five six seven oh five six the goalie skull baby

[01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:36.390]
Right kick those whoever they're playing the caps

[01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:38.030]
rhymes with

[01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:42.570]
Hard times to the Washington cast makes my heart feel so good

[01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:46.290]
Here's a mobile in Miami Beach hello

[01:14:59.690 --> 01:15:02.390]
Why are you sure? It's your hours to rip off any

Yeah, but you're not only but not only do you listen but you made the effort to call and share your brilliance with us for which

[01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:13.430]
I thank you profusely sir not only do you listen every day, but you also made the effort to call

[01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:17.670]
Which like I said that's above and beyond the call of duty

[01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:23.530]
We have an open line of Dave what in Broward fives and what Ellie's talking about. I have no idea five six seven oh five

60 and pop five six the other 18 to well

[01:15:25.570 --> 01:15:32.810]
And let me say it for the 50,000 time there was absolutely nothing on this show that in any way shape or form it relates to what

[01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:34.490]
Howard does or anybody else does

[01:15:35.190 --> 01:15:40.330]
I know that's very difficult for you to understand sir, but I'm sitting here in a room with the telephone. That's it

[01:15:52.450 --> 01:15:58.250]

[01:15:58.770 --> 01:16:03.030]

[01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:04.990]
I also got a spire port, but yeah

[01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:07.230]
Y'all they play him the next day

[01:16:07.770 --> 01:16:13.510]
And the reason I find out is because my wife comes up to the all I heard this on the radio and I'm saying yeah

For example last one was the basketball

[01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:31.530]

[01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:48.230]
I'm sorry and we love Bob and Tom. All right. Thank you. Have a great day. That's for Bob and Tom

[01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:49.350]

Get off the air and run a station of your own rather than putting up with all these incompetence that you're always complaining

[01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:25.290]
You're gonna you're gonna loan me 20 or 30 million to buy a station is that it?

[01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:28.550]
Leo you probably got a great deal as money and certainly

[01:23:29.230 --> 01:23:34.090]
Let me ask you this question if I had that kind of money when I'd be sitting here working every day

[01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:37.310]
I want you to scratch your head in that one spot there where your brain used to be

[01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:40.250]
I want you to scratch your real hard and ask yourself that question

[01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:43.390]
If this man had the kind of money that it would take to buy a radio station

[01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:47.690]
Would he be sitting there talking to bozos like this guy every day you think so no I don't think so

[01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:53.510]
I'd be long gone man you wouldn't even you wouldn't even be able to turn your head sideways that'd be gone

[01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:58.270]
So fast like the goddamn road runner. That's how fast I'd be gone right down the old Hershey highway

[01:23:59.850 --> 01:24:02.010]

[01:24:02.010 --> 01:24:06.950]
You know, yes sir. I don't want you on your own station. I don't want you to be a general manager

[01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:10.930]
People like me to keep me out of the road all day long from 10 to 2 plus in my ass

[01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:15.730]

[01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:58.870]
I sleep real well at night. Oh can't guess what on the days when I do go to the bank and the bankers and the tellers are there

[01:24:58.870 --> 01:25:02.750]
And not the security guard or somebody answering the phone like they don't know what side is up

Rescue that only a duty player, but he's a coward. He's a pussy who hides the you know

He crouches down and hides and if anybody ever hits him, which they do very rarely by the way

[01:25:47.330 --> 01:25:52.630]
Then he holds his head that pussy little helmet runs back to the bench and asks like something just speared him in the ugly push
