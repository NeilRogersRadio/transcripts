[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620]
They had the tapes out when I was talking about that goddamn pat at Pompato Park

[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.880]
And I just sat there reliving the whole experience. I was I was screaming at the set. Yes, right keep saying it

[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.840]
But he ate three four and I know there people say well, you know what he makes it to be a lot of that

[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.440]
I'm making a big deal because it was a big deal in my life

[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.020]
Because that moment that millisecond of my life just opened up a whole new outlook on everything in this goddamn place

[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.520]
What do you need three four? How about giving me a hundred? Okay, I got a hundred of my best personal friends gonna come

[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.160]
We're all gonna squeeze into our little box. How do you like that?

[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.500]
But just give me as many one dummy up. I love that it was a beautiful thing

[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.280]
So thank you so much Pat whoever to have you are

[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.480]
On by the way speaking of the far right how come we're not hearing anything about Dan Burton? I mean

[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.380]
Little representative Dan Burton from Indiana who's up there

[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.780]
First it wasn't either one that said Bubba was a scumbag. That's way. I love that song and that one of my favorites Bubba is a scumbag

[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.160]
But seriously he calls the president of the West a scumbag a few weeks ago

[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.340]
And then he's under a trying to put that bulldog janitor Reno and jail

[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.540]
And all of a sudden we find out over the weekend

[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.400]
We heard very little about this that Dan Burton had a child out of wedlock in the early 80s

[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.060]
He has a teenage son that nobody knew about

[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.260]
And then he's not the hoots but to come out there and say the over the weekend well

[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.760]
The reason that I'm addressing this now is because of course since I'm investigating somebody else that actually

[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.420]
That's the reason that this came to the front that's right and all you other phony right wingers out

[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.460]
They're including new noot mice during all the other ones

[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.680]
They're gonna be outed too for all their little uppecry dillows that they're doing

[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.500]
And you notice how everybody is running panicky now including a Daniel Patrick Moynihan with the a Batman lips and all the other

[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.720]
They a Joker lips all these people just to have peen in their pants because now they're finding out that the

[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.800]
Star report is gonna be really racy

[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.680]
It's gonna have every detail and haven't they been saying all along

[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.260]
It's not about sex and it's not they've been saying but guess what it is about sex

[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.940]
And she's doing with a cigar and they're doing this in the limo over here. What the hell kind of report is that?

[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.340]
And that's why there are running away from this thing like he's got leprosy and paulsy and very very at the same guy damn time

[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.080]
Because he was screwing around and the rest of the world continues laughing around soft

[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.700]
How about that mark McGuire huh?

[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.920]
and you know I've discovered that every I read three more articles over the weekend

[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.580]
Negative you know about that andro

[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.460]
Every single one of them was written by a woman and

[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.900]
What are they talking about here next door and he and their sales department?

[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.620]
We allowed are they being real loud and leak cutler's office again?

[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.820]
Are they in denial again in there about the fact that they talk to God damn loud while you ain't here try to do a radio show?

[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.180]
Yes, they are take it out in the hallway, okay? Take it over to power 96

[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.200]
They'll put you on the air they'll audition you take it over to Sheridan Street. Definitely give you a goddamn show

[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.360]
He'll put you on doing tags on the spots if you sell any

[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.600]
God are they loud over there?

[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.640]
What I was I said about Mark Mcguire and the andro one of these women know about the only them all these steroid written feminist bull-by-quim and other ones

[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.980]
They know about taking good steroids

[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.740]
But all these women want to pee on a parade you pee all you want sweet arts, but it was great

[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.940]
I just missed the yesterday

[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.740]
We didn't get home in time to see the home run but I saw the replay and it was number 61

[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.680]
And when surprised me at all if number 62 is coming up there tonight eight o'clock in Cardinals and the Cubs

[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.760]
Nice going Mark. You are a boring guy of a nice going and

[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.060]
Take it away Joe Joe Box said it best on Saturday during the telecast and HL and Rose okay

[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.080]
Baseball it's okay only in football and the IOC the International Olympic Committee

[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:56.120]
Which even bans some over-the-counter cold medications the IOC what a bunch of bluenos assholes they are

[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.500]
So don't come to be big in the middle of a bunch of crap about andro Mark Mcguire is doing it

[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.000]
I have a parade about it. Okay, even George is excited about it

[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.040]
Oh wait till I tell you with the real story about Jesus

[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.460]
Ten minutes after I'm telling it's incredible. Yeah, burn the bloody bitches

[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.300]
Oh

[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.120]
Shaving green so I let it all my face

[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:54.600]
I look like a church and I was fired into space

[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.860]
Driving home I was all alone

[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.740]
Thinking someone's playing tricks on me

[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.200]
But in the rear-view mirror I could see Jesus staring back at me

[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.020]
So

[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.300]
My path up

[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.840]
Nothing

[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.780]
Without

[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.080]
I

[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.120]
All

[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:52.320]
I saw him on the side of the top, so in the low pass on my car.

[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.880]
I saw him in a foliage beginning in the side of the smuggler's yard.

[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:08.420]
Yes, I saw him in a foliage beginning in the side of the smuggler's yard.

[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.920]
Yes, I saw him in a foliage beginning in the side of the smuggler's yard.

[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.440]
I saw him this honest digng of foulard bars.

[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:22.080]
I saw him on the pile of those carbono sheets, feet were found on cars.

[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.600]
All my friends take our mix, down into an pond,

[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:37.680]
I saw me this honesty of foulard bars.

[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.380]
to the Michigan and we're in to the Maddits if you're listening you ought to be ashamed

[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.280]
in a bearer. I mean I'm not ashamed in a bearer. Michigan's steak got

[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.000]
wild for the second week in a row because it's a girls football team we know

[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.520]
that. Respect to lose. But Michigan that he keeps talking and trying to go

[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.800]
by I saw that Michigan Notre Dame game released enough of it to make me six

[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.480]
Saturday and it finally dawned on me since there I mean nobody can tackle

[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.420]
that bad even little girls can tackle better than Michigan but the fix is in.

[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.140]
And it dawned on me finally that the strut of true in his for real it's just

[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.540]
been misinterpreted. Don't you understand what Jesus is saying? That's why all

[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.500]
these football players prayed to Jesus he's been in the football. The strut of

[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:21.320]
true in what Jesus doing. He's got his arms up like this touchdown. That's right

[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.440]
what do you think when they go back I like Doug Flutey to that great hail Mary

[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.440]
at the end of the game BC and Miami years ago. Nice going Doug Flutey to let

[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:34.460]
your field goal kickers sucks up there in Buffalo. Touchdown Jesus yeah that's

[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.320]
what they call it Notre Dame touchdown Jesus. Oh he's back to throw it's a

[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.220]
hail Mary and Notre Dame wins another goddamn game you know something I'm

[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:49.020]
gonna tell you this because it pisses me off here's a national network NBC the

[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.220]
Notre Dame Network. Well what is that what is that all above? I mean there are

[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.700]
universities that have their own television network within like you know

[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.880]
within the state but a national network carrying Notre Dame on here in Dick

[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.180]
Enberg that misery if I hear that dick one more time you know I used to like

[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:10.020]
him years ago when he wasn't didn't have such a big swell head like Joe Rose but

[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.240]
he's everywhere just too much he's oversaturated enough with Dick already okay

[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.920]
he was good once upon a time Dick Enberg but too much dick even had so too much

[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:25.680]
God I can't stand him the voice of Notre Dame touchdown Jesus so here's a

[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.760]
fact from Gert George did do a pretty good job and the exception of not using the

[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.760]
dump button with the effort well George did use the dump button but it wasn't

[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.040]
working because they had some technical problems here yesterday wow what a

[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.280]
concept oh this one I'm not this is that the scrawny little writing which I wouldn't

[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.880]
waste my time this is the one that doesn't know whether he hates me or loves me

[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.820]
or hey you know just chronic chronic we're looking for a fact and look at his

[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.640]
phone here we got one call on there and it's got 10 question marks on it that

[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.540]
show yesterday must have made an impact like you wouldn't believe so forget

[00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.040]
about the calls right now got more important stuff more important fish to fry

[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.200]
getting my car here on Friday at noon heading for the airport to get the

[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.400]
hell out of this God for second place for a long weekend get all the way to I

[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.060]
95 and I make my turn on the I 95 this has to do with cars and computers

[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.900]
whatever happened the good old days when we didn't have computers and cars see

[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.420]
the first bad experience I had with the computer in a car was back in Chicago

[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.820]
several years ago when we went up there to do our show from Murphy's bleachers

[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.900]
across from really feel and we had at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Chicago we had

[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.820]
rented that why they gave me that big Duke in a way that big continental and

[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.840]
there's four of us in noon one day getting ready to go to Ritzfield the

[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:44.140]
old ballpark and at the hotel I get my Lincoln continental in fact we went

[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.120]
up into the park and garage brought it down there the front and there's four

[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.700]
of us in the car my friend Dave there's a Cheryl Riffkin and her former husband

[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.720]
Mitch Wiener Riffkin whatever his name is and we're gonna wait and I pull

[00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.380]
out to take off I hit the gas and now the computer decides okay full throttle

[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:06.640]
bingo let's go don't you remember that you went there that year no I was not I

[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.380]
was down and if it weren't for in fact you can go I'm telling you right now see

[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.720]
and I left my mark in Chicago right there under pillar on that big pillar in

[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.520]
the middle of the parking area there and if we're ready for that pillar because

[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.260]
you go right out of the street there were hundreds of people walking I would

[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:24.500]
kill like all of us and all of them because of the computer in the car so

[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.740]
anyway I'm heading out to the airport here on Friday get to I'm gonna be five I

[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.340]
make my turn all of a sudden I hear these bells bang bang bang bang I'm

[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.140]
believable and I see that and all of a sudden they feel like all the power is

[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.960]
like gone out of from under my foot there's like nothing and it says flashing on

[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.840]
my computer reduced engine power and I thought oh no no crap what an

[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:50.540]
understatement that is as in no engine power as you know I'm coasting now

[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.480]
luckily I'm in the right hand lane so I pull over you know and off the shoulder

[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.180]
there just barely getting on the expressway and I wonder what and there's all

[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.920]
these lights all these warning lights but I'm being believable into bells or

[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.520]
ringing and I'm sitting there and of course my luck I don't have my cell phone

[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.060]
in that car I left it in the red car and like a schmuck that I am I don't have

[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.780]
as so I'm sitting there and my life is flashing before my eyes to get I'm

[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.340]
gonna miss the damn plane we're gonna have a you know stay here the whole day

[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.580]
I'm weekend which is a fate worth and death so I reach over turn off the

[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.720]
ignition and I thought to myself well what the hell can I do give it a shot turn

[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.940]
it on starts right up and the check engine light is on but all the other stuff is

[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:34.320]
gone no more bells no more puking no and there I go knock on wood okay off to

[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.780]
the erases no problem come back yesterday getting a car even the check

[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:45.220]
engine light is finally gone history everything's fine I get home I look at my

[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.920]
owner's manual the check engine light is on with some when some kind of a I

[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.260]
should have brought the thing an emissions problem a exit who cares about

[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.440]
emissions I'm driving to work this morning there's a diesel truck for now you

[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.660]
can't even see where you're going it's pouring out so much damn oil and I'm

[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:05.200]
worried about emissions not turn or otherwise I mean what the hell are we talking

[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.300]
about here and then well and I'm trying to figure out what the hell that means

[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.540]
reduced engine power and you know I'm saying to myself at this point I will

[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:17.000]
never ever drive that car again except for the dealer to trade it in you know

[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.900]
how that is I maybe it's only me but when you lose confidence in a car in other

[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.140]
words a couple weeks ago the lights come on ABS breaking system check ABS and

[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.520]
there was nothing wrong with the ABS brakes but the lights came on and like

[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.480]
later on the same day they went out so my computer is starting to have like

[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.200]
little parts all over the place and what disturbs me keeps bringing back the

[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.760]
memory to me of going your computer locks in and all of a sudden it locks in

[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.300]
the accelerator and by the big you just and you can't stop the car like

[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.080]
happened to me that one time in Chicago with that big continental which I should

[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.640]
have sued their ass because plenty of people have told me the old one you know

[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.380]
uh Ford's got a problem with that many continental's we've heard about yeah

[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.660]
to copy what did your mother ever tell you that you were the best and brightest

[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:28.480]
did your father ever tell you that if you put your mind to it you could accomplish

[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.260]
anything you want did your older sister ever come home from college crying her eyes out

[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.540]
because the world was unfair and she was stuck in a run well she was the old

[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:42.120]
person in your family that wasn't a big old barrel of the world is tough and

[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.780]
chances are you aren't the best for the brightest and when you put your mind to

[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.180]
things you still come up short to get ahead in this world you need to cheap

[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.420]
lie steel or get pressed in plants you need every little edge you can get in this

second down call by the way here's a sunrise hello sunrise hello yes sir yeah I'm

[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:25.400]
tiny old how you doing I'm doing okay I got a newer General Motors vehicle it did the same

[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:31.420]
thing about four times really and basically what finally they told me at the dealership that what

[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:38.340]
you need to do is crank down the gas cap when you fill up crank down the gas cap yeah it's a pressurized

[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:44.080]
fuel system and it gets an it gets a different reading if that gas cap isn't tightened down you

[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.880]
know something I think that probably is it because I had just I had just filled up the tank like

[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.740]
the a 94 and that might be it and maybe you get it at the full service and the guy didn't crank

[00:20:54.740 --> 00:21:00.640]
it down or I didn't do it I never do full service I I did my I pumped my own so to speak well I did

[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.880]
that a couple of times and you just got to crank it down because you know I'm like yes I did more

[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.500]
five times yeah because there was nothing wrong with the car because how the hell could I've

[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.520]
driven all the way from I've very road to the airport and then back home now yesterday if

[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.880]
there'd been any even like you know I'm checking all the I'm checking everything the oil and I'm

[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.620]
checking the temperature every every possible thing to see if there's any problems I'm driving

[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.440]
under because they don't want to damage the engine but there was nothing wrong with it yeah crank down

[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:29.280]
the gas cap would have cranked through it okay thanks put a crank to it there you go there's a guy

[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.760]
that sawed my problem right off the bat and I'm ready to trade in my car just because I had to put

[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:39.180]
a crank to it crank it down tight baby that's the way to do it two open lines in date one and

[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:44.060]
brown or five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line you don't have to feel

[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:48.280]
compelled to call in say that you like George better than the tapes but I sure hope you do but

[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.640]
let's give a give us an honest analization here those tapes suck get rid of the tapes number one

[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.380]
it's so time consuming for him not to make those and it's always dated I'm talking about stuff

[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:02.140]
that happened a hundred years ago by the way did I mention that Kevin Week sucks no I didn't

[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:07.660]
mention that you did I oh yeah his agent is holding out Kevin Weeks and Brian Murray's really

[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.020]
pissed off you know the sad part of this whole deal is because being in Toronto over the weekend

[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:16.700]
by the way American Airlines is great oh thank god for American Airlines I love them the food is

[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:21.880]
great their flights are great I love American Airlines we had a lady pilot by the way going up

[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:28.260]
there you ever had a lady capatano yes very good only she was talking too loud on either I mean I

[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.560]
know they can't tell how loud it's coming over usually the problem is then you're clapping and

[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.920]
they're forty four down there and you can't understand what they're saying usually that's the deal

[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:42.560]
but she was so loud but she was very good so some of my old sexist views in fact maybe if that

[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.680]
Swiss air I shouldn't say that so but he you know a lot of people now saying that he screwed up

[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.400]
you're not supposed to say that about you know these experienced pilots but they're saying that

[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.780]
when you have smoke or any kind of fire on board you don't dittle around it like you know take

[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:00.780]
it as nonchalantly as he did and circle around and start dumping fuel if you're going to take a

[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:06.860]
dump that's a dump you take and they're saying that even though he was like only 30 miles from

[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:12.400]
Halifax that still he could have if he descended like what they say like five thousand feet per minute

[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:17.200]
for six minutes he could have done it and even with a heavy load in fact I was reading over the

[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:22.540]
weekend that it's safer to crash even on a runway on cement that it is on the water because of

[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.740]
the way the water like whatever whatever whatever the way it makes contact with these aluminum

[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:34.620]
shell of the aircraft now but at any rate too late now I guess we have two open lines and date

[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.420]
fine and of course people are saying well you know after you read about that aren't you a little

[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:42.500]
bit nervous when you get up there and fly any flim no so air candidate I know you're on strike

[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.760]
and we hope Helene gets her job back real soon and we love her and our friends at air

[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:51.220]
Canada but you know hey that American Airlines is pretty damn good two open lines in day five six seven

[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:57.680]
oh five fifty and the food we didn't have no sea wolf we didn't have no mahi mahi we had damn good

[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:03.260]
two good meals on air and American Airlines nice go on guys that I direct they serve on air Canada

[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:11.360]
here's a mobile in Miami hello hello yes sir oh yeah no before I get the George I want to tell you

[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:17.300]
this Saturday I was desperate for something to listen to and I was in the car working I was

[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:24.640]
listening to the circus Tennessee game on QAM Q driving right past your building on 441 couldn't

[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.920]
hear as long as it's not coming out of the studio there's no crack one no cuching no nothing it

[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:35.660]
sounds great yeah what it means long as it's not coming out of the studio why would that have

[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:41.940]
anything to do with the signal I guess because it was west with one I don't know if it's

[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:48.180]
sounded fun though I mean you know it's breaking up so bad on 441 now I can't hear yeah you

[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:53.840]
can ever hear us on 441 that's by intent Saturday Saturday it was fun though but it was a football

[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.620]
game that wasn't anything you know what our first choice would do a lot better if they could hear us

[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:03.500]
on 441 because most of their audience is right by those gun shops yeah probably yeah

[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.360]
so it's done great yesterday a lot better than the type okay thank you sir thank you okay so far

[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.660]
it's unanimous we don't have one person now come on it can't have been that good okay I'm sure

[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.980]
he did a fine job and it was my idea in the first place and I'm delighted to hear it but there's

[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.120]
got to be somebody out there some cryptic asshole he really sucked okay something like that just

[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:26.940]
uh so we don't get a big swell hit like Joe Rose day lines are wide open five six seven oh five

[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:33.220]
sixty look at that we just passed the 300 mark the Dow is up 302 points and then as the 72

[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.880]
yeah let's get it up there about 7800 points and then sell everything and then just calm down okay

[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:44.440]
then just sit back and relax and laugh at it you know speaking of money Lorenzo here's a Boston hello

[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:52.320]
hello yes sir hi good morning I'm calling to beat up on the song Florida fans yeah I'm a dog fan up here in

[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:58.060]
Boston um what's the deal done in my game last night by the way yeah what that I said nice game last night

[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:03.700]
yeah actually I was reading the article and now they might be held this morning you stole 5,000 tickets

[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.060]
available you know the dolphins are the only marquee team and the NFL it doesn't sell out from

[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.880]
systems yeah you know Buffalo is crappy as they are Buffalo has got all their games already sold

[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.940]
out this year the whole thing yeah he's just sold out for the Jacksonville way can you give me it

[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:20.620]
you know I'm 3000 miles away why we're with the problem down this is miss sports town you know

[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:27.020]
that what do you mean look around here no it's not ridiculous I wonder how come the newspapers here

[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.000]
didn't have the attendance you know you of them like all these other schools they beat up on our

[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.900]
girl school again Saturday East Tennessee State I wonder how come they didn't put the attendance

[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.420]
what was in there in the orangeville we were very interested to see how many showed up and they're

[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.120]
too embarrassed to put the attendance in there because the only time it's a real big football town

[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.360]
is if a number one team is winning your big game or number two the opponent happens to be like a

[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.100]
marquee you know like Florida or Notre Dame or something yeah they're gonna lose the team you

[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.880]
know beautiful stadium like they say it's a marquee team they're gonna lose that stadium they're

[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.840]
gonna lose that team they're gonna lose what team the dolphins yeah okay I hear them complain I hear

[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:01.280]
everybody down they complain about their zinger and the mile ends and that I'm a red sock spin I've

[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.200]
gone a hundred years without a championship out of the wheat field we don't complain like that

[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:09.440]
that they don't show up for the dog and the red socks you'll feel it's a minute just a minute the red

[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.860]
socks took the field last night and your people at the anyway park booed the crap out of them

[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.400]
sir I have two satellite dishes I don't miss a thing they booed the crap out of

[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.440]
and then they finally came from behind a you know pulled it out there David Wells is

[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.700]
going to lose the season by the way what a guy he is you know the difference between a red

[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:29.100]
sock though with the red socks can show up when the red socks are bad they tell them how bad they are

[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:33.500]
because that's a sports town you don't have to tell me that that's right well buy some kick it

[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:38.600]
huh okay try to get the patriots to win a game will you all right okay yeah they they they just

[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.400]
the same old crap you know blood so he's confused he's wasting all his time out it's same old

[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.680]
crap for them every year we have an open line see these people think that the other guys in the

[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.400]
space of the sports experts I see more sports in one day than most of these guys see in two weeks

[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:57.220]
all these guys that talk a big game what they're talking about open line and date one and

[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:02.560]

of the computer reduced engine power what about if I was in the middle lane they're going like 70

[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.720]
miles an hour and all of a sudden it decides reduced engine power and I can't even accelerate well

[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:31.680]
the your computer in your car has a memory and take it to the dealer and the memory will read back

[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:36.480]

Boston fans they finally won again they've been choking like a goddamn accordion lurches like

[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:32.860]
their famous for Toronto has been what were they 150 games behind them with about two weeks to go

[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.140]
and all of a sudden that Boston loses every day until they finally pull the game out last night

[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:41.940]
and all of a sudden they're talking a big crap okay Boston's a real city if in fact Boston

[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:48.460]
what a coincidence I have from American Express the travel and leisure the big thick one the

[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:52.380]
annual one where they have a pool of their 10,000 readers of people that travel all over the world

[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.360]
and really know what the world is all about as opposed to most of you who never go more than 10 blocks

[00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:04.480]
from home and this year's top 25 cities in the world which Boston is number 20 don't see Miami

[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:10.080]
on there nowhere don't see any Florida cities on there nowhere the top 25 cities in the world

[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:16.640]
based on attractions culture people value and restaurants and Boston is number 20 which your

[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:21.620]
let's see Chicago say well I'll give you the list in a minute three of them by the way

[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.200]
more than three of them like a bunch of them are like an Australian New Zealand well it may be great

[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:31.480]
on there but who the hell are you know who can afford 10 weeks to fly down there by the time you

[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:37.180]
get there it's time to turn around and come back oh yeah those Boston fans we add great okay in the

[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:41.580]
meantime you lost your game last night it was the same old tired stuff I'm pulling for the patriots

[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:46.780]
in the you know same old tired baloney nice field go kick into there by the way if there's

[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.620]
anybody out here in this audience can kick up all more than 15 yards like on a straight line

[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:55.220]
you're signed up immediately same with the bills there here little duck flutty comes out there

[00:34:55.220 --> 00:35:00.280]
on Sunday little duck flutty man I love duck flutty because of that hail Mary touchdown Jesus

[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:04.780]
that hail Mary if you're against the hercones years ago I'll never forget that as long as I live

[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:10.900]
for BC comes in there to touchdown passes for the bills he leads him down the field gets him in

[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:15.780]
field role position and Steve Christie who blew an easy field goal early in the game he blows it

[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:21.340]
wide again you saw he pulled it he was pulling it in the football too I think new Christie could have

[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.640]
done a better job than Steve Christie kicking at field roles they blow another big one

[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:31.360]

[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:44.700]
he did good up there hey you know he was in the CFL for eight years with the Argonauts right he was

[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:48.880]
the player of the year in the league six out of the eight years yeah how can you beat that Joseph

[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:55.700]
Gaki Gaki the other day he was well is the Gaki sucks okay okay yeah well anyway have

[00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:01.320]
opened up his big mouth at his opinion all of if uh if looting's got to play this Sunday he got

[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:07.600]
the dolphins you can count on the dolphins winning I swear I'm a dolphin fan but I hope they lose

[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.500]
this weekend if they shut down the Gaki first of all he's not going to be starting because this

[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:17.640]
rookie who played terrible I saw most of that game uh sorry yes Sunday and uh the kid is horrible

[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:22.260]
and so the the rookie's gonna start but the dolphin fans should hope that the the kid is healthy

[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:26.240]
and that's who he doesn't come in again because if looting comes in there in trouble I by agree

[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.500]
even at his age he's 35 years old he's still mobile he's still a lucid he's still ran for two or

[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:34.920]
three first downs he's a hell of a competitor let me tell you something you get about George but

[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.640]
I don't know I don't know he's sucking up here but go ahead what's Lindsay I mean God's how can

[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.800]
he even put him in the same category as a punky little sports geeks at night because he doesn't

[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:44.300]
the sporting brews from the sporting brews because it's Tuesday but we don't have no schedule over

[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:48.840]

two open lines in date one and brown five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the 18t

[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.920]
Leahy remember those factions that used to come in from pierced Leahy like real chronic like eight

[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:08.240]
million of them thank you so much Santana whoever you are your music sucks by the way here's one that's

[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.300]
George was fine at least he had a show and didn't take requests like the bird didn't play their

[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:17.880]
rack he sounded like an adult in other words as opposed to like uh some of the kids we have on the

[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:22.720]
ear here he was no goldie with a squeaky voice or hanks board officer producers that sound like

[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.960]
three year olds amen why does the station continue to have kids do the baseball show before the

[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.680]
pregame show with bird with boog with bird boog bird I'll tell you why because they they've if

[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:36.060]
they've had an adult in here they have to pay them some real money why does this station have kids

[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:41.100]
do spots that people pay good money for there is a real good question that I've been asking for

[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.980]
the last eight months and several odd days since we've been here George was not boring but could use

[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:49.280]
a little a life for future shows my only problem is he's constantly be feared for you as the old man

[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:54.180]
or the old fat man or something like that which is the nicest thing most people say about me here's

[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:58.960]
another one from uh lawyer no less Alan dear Uncle Neil loved your yesterday however beware of the

[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.880]
eyes of Julio suggest you immediately go out and rent all about eve before it's too late

[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:11.100]
okay or rent Adam and the Steve before it's too late is that what it was oh speaking of Adam and

[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:16.040]
Steve what I do with that letter to the editor oh here it is in the hero today because these

[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.020]
newspapers just can't give up on his conversion bull crap I mean they're obsessed with this

[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:26.180]
and here's a letter from Charles Burr drives with purge in pompato beach campaign not in tolerant

[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:31.760]
homosexual activists are trying to shut down the center for reclaiming america's truth in love

[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:38.820]
ad campaign the point is that homosexuals can change thousands have those who have our thankful

[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:44.340]
that someone offered a way out why is it why is that intolerant or hateful seems to be the most

[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:48.700]
decent thing to do the last sentence of this letter seems to be the most well I got news for

[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:53.820]
a child's burgey burgey and pompato beach purgey how about being a decent guy and turning into a

[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:58.780]
homosexual if homosexuals can become heterosexual then I'll come heterosexual can't just say

[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:05.260]
poof I'm gonna be a homosexual huh it seems like the decent thing to do as whole you idiot

[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:14.560]
we have two open lines and date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t line

[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:20.360]
anybody ever been in the city australia or Melbourne I mean if it's the greatest city in the

[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:25.780]
world we'd like to find out what else going on it it's so great here's the moral gables hello

[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:31.840]
meal yes sir yeah two din yesterday thinking I'd only two din for like 20 minutes or so just to

[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.780]
check it out and you were glued to it I actually was I was entertained pretty very interesting

[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:41.720]
but he was talking he was talking I'm trying to get there about how great Montana was and seeing

[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:46.760]
it's pretty I didn't think he knew anything about football all right well we told this to him from

[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:52.040]
Montana I think it's so great but I want to know that's that's that Kazinsky and you know

[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:55.840]
like a guy who shot at the capital they don't look there because people mind their own business

[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.460]
to the other people people mind their own business just like in Arizona while they're building

[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:03.560]
bombs yeah Montana Freeman I mean they come all the moons bunch of moons living up there

[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.840]
but they're right eastern part anyway and they all have orange here they look like boogshambah

[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.940]
they all have orange here it looked like they've been doing in breeding for about 500 centuries

[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:14.860]
right so I thought that might just be something to be aware of well see sure that this is always

[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:19.680]
kind of a summary I don't dwell on it but George's biggest problem is that he spent most of his

[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:26.040]
life in Montana North Carolina and Florida so you put that together I mean now what do you expect

[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.960]
yeah he's damn it's good he just can't afford to go anywhere I mean if they ever decided to pay

[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:33.900]
me anything that'll be different story hey I saw something on Discovery Channel in Sunday night

[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:39.600]
about see post office yeah about theft and all that and they had one piece they had one piece

[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:45.020]
where a postal inspector gets called out and temporary postal delivery guy had dumped his whole

[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:50.140]
sack of mail and a dumpster yeah and I was wondering maybe your mail was in there I wouldn't be surprised

[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:55.120]
right okay thanks for the good news yeah wouldn't be surprised but you know something I don't care

[00:48:55.120 --> 00:49:00.760]
anymore just like I'm just like Chris Darden said it's uh I don't give a sh** that's exactly the

[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:36.400]
to Sydney yes but only to make connections to go to Brisbane oh so I only spent a day in Sydney to

[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:40.740]
me it was sort of a provincial little town oh I shouldn't say a little town's a pretty big city

[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:46.560]
this was like 20 years ago yeah well how do you know that but how do you know that if you only

[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:51.200]
made connections there why was there for a day I missed the connection on the way back and I had

[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:57.900]
to spend the night in Sydney so I had a full day in full 24 hours at Sydney right and I walked

[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:03.980]
around to check things out and it's a nice town too far too far away from from here for me oh yeah it's

[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:11.680]

[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:36.720]
sac religious to me they don't got no pope in Sydney maybe that's why they're above it in fact if

[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:40.700]
they would chip the damn pope out of Rome Rome would be number one that's right all the Romans

[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:47.120]
would be running around we're number one God damn it so no no no no but instead of that we got

[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:07.600]

[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:26.420]
what I do like though in Europe is the trains the trains are great see I always had an

[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:30.260]
diversion to trains because many many years ago when I went to college because I think the last

[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:35.440]
time I was on a train in this country I was going from like Rochester to somewhere the

[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:40.500]
lancing I guess I must have been on a train in a through a snowstorm in Buffalo and the train

[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:44.700]
and we had a stop and got stuck in Potsky around it took me for urban and it was a nightmare

[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:49.320]
and so that kind of sourd me a little bit about train just like that thing with my Corvette

[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:55.340]
sourman computers and cars about the reduced engine power reduced engine power no

[01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:05.480]
got a bite it crap that was a good comeback no crap Sherlock I'm I got my floor the thing in my

[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:12.620]
foot too and that car is like coming to a screeching called reduced engine power so you tend to get

[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:17.700]
turned off on a little bit like when alcohol stink was down here humping the cheer the other day

[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:27.120]

the comments almost all them and very glowing and praising George did a great job yesterday

[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:13.400]
but uh- somebody brought me in a cassette tape of the highlights of George's performance in

[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:16.660]
which you know when you hear the real thing it's a lot more revealing than just hearing everybody

[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:43.460]
talking around let's hear what it sounded like see

[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:49.800]
okay two open lines and date know what they like the five six seven oh five sixty

[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.240]
pound five sixty on the mobile one line he must have been sending out free samples too uh

[01:26:54.700 --> 01:27:00.940]
here's plantation hello hill yes sir I was wondering if you happen to notice in the paper that

[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:06.820]
the L.A. King signed granados just did a cold color for the hockey games games

[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:11.160]
uh you think I think it's got any women in mind to pull uh

[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:16.360]
color for our pants is other than sure what language are you speaking what are you talking about

[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:21.440]
I read in today's uh USA today that the L.A. King's of Hyatt only for not a sister

[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:26.760]
to do the color commentary on the L.A. King's hot today the colored commentary will maybe Kevin

[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:30.120]
Witt's can do the colored commentary because he don't look like he's gonna be standing up to be

[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:35.380]
playing anywhere we have two open lines in date one and brownered five six seven oh five sixty

[01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:41.160]
pound five sixty on the mobile one line here's Kendall hello hey how you doing this is

[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:45.900]
a ride everyone from happy book today um football that got a little more and it's about the

[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:50.840]
L.A. King's color commentary nobody thank you um I thought George did a really good job yet today

[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:55.800]
yeah um I enjoyed he was pretty fresh you know he said what was on his mind then tried to

[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:02.320]
clear put around the city but he didn't everything see yeah and uh oh how about that see and uh

[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:07.060]
I thought uh one thing I want to say about is there's nothing I enjoy I love watching Michigan

[01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:11.340]
Williams but I hate root for Notre Dame yeah I hate it that's the only time I ever root for

[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:14.960]
Michigan is when they're playing Notre Dame in 80 they stuck the joint I'm telling it with the

[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.640]
worst tackling team in the history of college they couldn't bring down my grandmother and she's

[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:24.180]
been dead for 22 years and she's doing a jogging across the field that's right across the goal line

[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:28.440]
and I don't understand why Las Vegas wasn't on the list all the funnest time I ever had in my life

[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:33.260]
yeah I want to say hi and I'm good to have you back but George did do a pretty good job

[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:37.760]
excellent thank god okay see ya take it uh that's right that shows you how bogus this list is

[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.220]
because Las Vegas I guess you're not supposed to have too much of a good time maybe that's why

[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:48.040]
this list is a little restricted Dave County's open 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line

thank you see yeah thanks for the good news okay date your order this is brutal man I thought I

[01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:51.720]
yesterday George would have this audience worked up for me today and come back they'd be there'd

[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:57.020]
be an outpouring and it was the same I sat down here nothing nothing had a weedle and tweedle

[01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:02.620]
and twiddled these people like from the very get go today all three lines in date are wide open

[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:07.220]
and one and brown and fine of course it's the day after labor day every day that I've done this

[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:12.120]
show when we weren't given stuff away of course every other day 22 and a half years there's been

[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:18.220]
some excuse what is it today it's a full moon it's today after labor day it's a Monday it's something

[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:24.060]
something to excuse these people and we had one call today about Mark McGuire it's number 61

[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:28.580]
yesterday against the Cubs no against Mike Morgan with your nice high fastball air nothing

[01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:33.020]
the greatest moment in my lifetime in sports I would say except those forced

[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:38.720]
and they cubs the leaps one a lifetime ago unbelievable excitement and these people like and

[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:43.820]
I'm going to tell you right now if I have one negative comment about Mark McGuire I'm going to

[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:48.240]
go ballistic you think I did a lot of time on that pad from the racetrack with that program business

[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:53.680]
but I'll guarantee there's a bunch of old parts in this town for still ready to find something

[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:57.400]
negative about it because this guy you know ain't no babe Ruth or whatever they want to come up with

[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:02.420]
and by the way do I the guy was right last week back in those days in the 20s

[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:06.280]
when they had different rules when they didn't have the same ground rules when you hit

[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:09.900]
out like what would be a ground rule double that bounced into the stands that was a home run

[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:14.460]
and I have a feeling we have no way of knowing the records how many of them no it's

[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:19.180]
isn't to take anything away from baby Ruth but I'm sure that some of those 60 home runs in 1927

[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:22.120]
maybe some of them bounced into goddamn stands how do we know

[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:27.980]
Mark McGuire the one guy the one guy that kids can look up to they're not going to be out there doing

[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:32.040]
the andro and then I'm not going to be in hurricane andru and then I'm not going to be all like a

[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:35.840]
bunch of muscle bond freaks which how come the way he talks about Jose Konseko when it comes to

[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:39.840]
muscle bond freaks and steroids or it's because he's Cuban and he's from this town okay

[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.160]
and speaking of from this town let me say it again Alex Rodriguez I'll use sports experts

[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.820]
who talk on his station probably be the greatest shortstop in history of this game he's from

[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:53.800]
this town is anybody ever talk about him no because he's not Cuban he's from LaBri

[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:58.120]
public in the minicana like all the great baseball players like Sammy Sosa they're from LaBri

[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:02.040]
public in the minicana that's right that one big island one side of the island they're so

[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:08.120]
on the baseball the other side of the island they're hitting them that's right whatever the hell that

[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:15.800]
means here's a mobile in the for-later day oh hello great any you George did a great job by

[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:21.980]
the way but that's how I'm calling okay let me ask you a question are these people catching those

[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:27.960]
baseballs are they stupid given them back to Mark McGuire for a kiss shirt what do you mean by that

[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:33.040]
I mean I would not know they're not stupid they're giving they're doing whatever they want to do

[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:38.120]
when Roger Meris hit a 61st home run the guy that caught it came and brought it back to him and

[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:43.000]
Meris gave it gave it to him and he said get whatever you can for it the guy the guy got five grand for it

[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:48.060]
right but now they're saying that like the 60s back in it's gonna be like over a million I said I

[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:53.300]
would never I mean I'd go to the highest fitter and I'm a fan sure do you understand what I'm saying

[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:57.260]
to in other words like the little kids that got the ball and they brought them to him the kids here

[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:02.560]
and they didn't want money they were offered like thousand dollars by some guy who was like

[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:06.440]
standing right there waiting to intercept them and get the ball for like your fun and profit

[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:12.620]
they turned it down they didn't want money why why why because McGuire makes millions of millions of

[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:17.020]
dollars this gets paid from the middle wait wait a minute what does McGuire have to do with whether

[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:21.920]
or not they get something otherwise you think he should pay him for it yeah that's only because

[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:27.900]
he can pay him for the baseball you can't apply for middle income how do you know that they're

[01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:31.500]
from middle income housing whatever whatever that means how do you know how what they're from

[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:37.100]
all right you know he's a bit there with I mean to give away a couple hundred thousand dollars and

[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:41.340]
million dollars I mean it's like what are I'm gonna say I'm gonna say it to the same thing I said to

[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:47.540]

Neil yes sir I'm so glad you went to a break instead of letting you follow us two hours

[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:06.020]
these calls oh god they're a pathetic I mean what's the problem doing the right thing that's what

[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:10.060]
these people are doing they're giving the fall back to being nice guys they're actually missing the

[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:14.860]
game the guy that got the whole month on the first inning this cheering team it took them away

[01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:19.180]
yeah you get the rest of the game you had to watch it on TV right right so the face making a

[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:23.680]
sacrifice for him you see in a good giant you doing the right thing by giving it back and not only

[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:27.560]
that what is it this guy's business that he's telling other people what their values ought to be

[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:31.700]
if the if the guy wants an autographed baseball and a batter whatever they want him that's enough

[01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:36.740]
that's his business that's right and this guy this guy's knocking people who aren't greedy like he is

[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:41.480]
exactly from the men this playery that doesn't have a blotch on his I mean not one negative thing

[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:44.980]
you can say about him and these people got no interest in him down here because he's not

[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:49.440]
making that a big deal maybe this is first for the negative maybe there's so used to

[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:54.160]
all the universe I guarantee if Alan's proud regans was Cuban he'd be on the front page of the

[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:59.980]
front section of the Harold every god damn day let's see home run again just a second home runs

[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:06.120]

an open line in power at five six seven oh five sixty the Dow is now up a hundred ninety four

[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:27.740]

in Stewart hello hey Neil how are you okay sir good deal listen I was following in regards to the

[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:41.840]
market wise saying and you looked at the last couple of years there was no excitement what

[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:47.420]
the weather and baseball right I think this is fantastic I think it's LL's R&T Rose and going for

[01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:52.840]
4192 like 10 years or so ago I think it's about time all these people with the talent

[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:57.860]
forces you shut the hell up and start celebrating some fun again baseball I think maybe they should

[01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:02.600]
take up a hobby like Russian Roulette would be good for some of them yeah exactly a full of good

[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:08.360]
favorite crap limbaugh right hey thanks Neil I'll go have a great day pal we have an open line in

[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:14.660]
Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line there is nothing in all our sports I heard

[01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:21.100]
somebody call it in over the weekend on some show not here oh well you know there's records

[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:26.920]
that are more important than this a Joe D and there's no record in any sport that is more sacred

[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:30.860]
that is more significant I'm not saying there aren't there aren't achievements there are greater

[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:36.960]
but in terms of the significance with the public than that home one record period so it's only a

[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.380]
sport big deal at least it's something something we can be positive about something we can get

[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:45.660]
excited about we got the presidents getting ready to be impeached we got Dan Burton is admitting

[01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:52.340]
he father and illegitimate child back in the early 80s but nobody's talking about that we got

[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:56.640]
the goddamn sadoms over there they're six months they're going to be ready to start to do a nuclear

[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:00.440]
weapons or whatever they're going to be doing over in Iraq we got all kinds of crap going on all

[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:05.520]
over the world I mean the whole economy of the world is in a shambles and what are people negative

[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:11.660]
negative even if there's something good going on did I see Miami on his list by the way of the

[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:16.020]
top five thousand cities in the world of the top 60 thousand places to live no

[01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:25.560]
here's the Miami hello hello Neil yes sir how you doing okay I agree with you that the home one

[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:30.040]
record is probably one of the greatest things in sports but where I'll tell you where I disagree with

[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:35.360]
you yes I really think if you look at what's happening this year you have three people at a

[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:40.180]
hundred feet over fifty home ones yeah got the RBI records it's in jeopardy that's been around for

[01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:45.500]
more time I don't think so I don't think Gonzales got no chance you don't think so no what's what's he

[01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:52.020]
got the records 190 right I don't think it's that right yes it is it isn't what is he I'm about

[01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:59.080]
150 RBI's he's got 148 no chance what he good though but anyway I have 43 to break and there's

[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:03.680]
only like the I get you right I thought he was close with that why he pulled off like everybody else

[01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:08.440]
yeah well with pressure maybe whatever it is but I'll tell you I think the ball is a little

[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:13.700]
off top you know there's so many people that are hitting over 40 ohm ones this year three over

[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:18.360]
50 and I like Mark McGuire I think he's a great guy has anything to do with it I think the fact

[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:22.180]
that you got a lot of crappy pitching you think it's a pitching you got expansion you got Arizona

[01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:26.300]
you got Tampa Bay you got the Marlins which has got a little league pitching step you got very

[01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:30.020]
inferior pitching and that's why you have more and more home ones and I think there's a different

[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:36.420]
pitching okay all right okay thank you okay every great day is gagging on it okay see God

[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:47.220]
works in mysterious ways he's cooking on his own words 23 till we're all gagging on it we have

[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:53.040]
an open line indeed 56705 60 time 560 on a mobile one line that Joe was in here gagging on

[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:58.800]
pizza yesterday is the room where we heard that's right not just the topping either he was eating the

[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:07.740]
crust and was I picking out over the weekend oh damn right dammit I'm as big as a god damn walrus

[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:14.760]
you know I sat there I sat my hotel room yesterday morning in my underwear looking watching the

[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:19.140]
TV and it was like a mirror I mean not on a mirror but like a reflective glass

[01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:29.300]
yes and I sat there looking at myself sitting on that sofa on that cut a bed I have never been other

[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:33.700]
than when our gold thing came in here and tried to goose me your last ride I have never been so grossed

[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:38.720]
out and so it's because because when you're sitting you know how the fat kind of like

[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:44.060]
alt everything the drop the drone yeah everything like drops down and like is exaggerated but never

[01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:50.800]
less and I'm I swear to god I had hooters that were as big as grandma Moses on a bed and my

[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:57.080]
puppet was like hanging down there I looked at that and I thought good god that's one of the most

[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:05.260]
disgusting things I have ever seen in my life that was before lunch 22 till one of QA

[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:32.480]
thing he did the right thing for him if he wanted if money was all that important to him he would

[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:36.080]

somewhere or something that not not only that but you one thing that most of these idiots never

[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:05.360]
thought about and that is what makes collectibles valuable what makes a baseball worth a million

[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:09.940]
dollars what made baseball cards worth a lot of money when I was a kid collecting baseball cards

[01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:14.060]
I had shoe boxes full of baseball cards and one day my mother threw them all out when I

would pay why is it worth something these things are only worth something if some maniac

[01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:33.360]
besides that they want to pay a lot of money for it exactly exactly well why is that a fiber a

[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:37.740]

first goes on to level name it to run down pedestrian and hall at home section of the game

[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:58.760]
this leads your game police to battle and the player must come up with a different excuse to go

[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:05.520]
home and get his license there is off to the final leg of the board game higher in attorney go to

this god for sánchez with only ninety seven son centel readers out of twenty seven hundred

[01:55:36.420 --> 01:55:41.240]
picking him as the areas best news anchor wsv and channel sevens rick sánchez could use a few more

[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:47.380]
admirers but he won't find them among the sprawling pot luck nursery in david sánchez ordered more

[01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:53.960]
than a thousand dollars worth of exorers and lyreo pays i'm not a plant god the plant around his

[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:58.920]
Cooper city home for his 40th birthday party he also ordered a few sánchezia plants because

[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:03.980]
their name sounded like his according to a pot luck sales hole sánchez however never picked up

[01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:09.760]
the plants or paid for them could it be because the salesman didn't show up much enthusiasm when

[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:18.440]
sánchez asked for a channel seven discount said sánchez did i ask for a discount yes but not a

[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:23.480]
channel seven discount asking for a discount when you buy large quantities is not improper it's good

[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:28.720]
business whether you run television or the president says rick sánchez how do you like that

do a big bowl wasn't about money then yeah it's all big bucks today yeah they'll get you to

[01:57:53.620 --> 01:57:58.760]

[01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:21.600]
like how much whatever the market fair yeah and and that's it and your whole craft no that's not

[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:25.400]
no you know how powerful a craft why should these kids be the goat then though they're not the

[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:28.960]
ghost they could have asked for whatever they wanted they didn't want the money yeah but you're

[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:33.500]
telling you're telling kids get out of here they're innocent kids that's what they wanted they're

[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:38.640]
not dummies the guys did there with a hundred dollar bills after the one down here after 58 and 59

[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:43.140]
we're not interested in the money don't kid yourself these kids grow up at a mercenary guide

[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:47.720]
dam society they know what money's all about the first they don't say mommy your daddy anymore the

[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:52.040]
first thing they say after they start to speak is don't be fester that's right so don't give me

[01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:56.060]
this crap about their naive little kids they just aren't mercenary like you are sir

[01:58:57.480 --> 01:59:02.540]
air every time something good comes along we got assholes like this want to find the negative

[01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:07.460]
let's work overtime let's work ourselves up into a fever pitch to find something negative so

[01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:13.560]
we can criticize anytime somebody does something that might be admirable let's rip him for it okay

[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:18.020]
let's put the knock on him because they're stupid and naive you're the one that's stupid

[01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:24.780]
million dollars for a goddamn baseball and people you're crawling all over each other so

[01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:29.140]
you can get their hands on a ball it might be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars because the

[01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:33.080]
whole thing is and that's the whole point right there it's disintegrated none of them but dollars

[01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:38.940]
and cents and here's a whole thing that's going on a whole event that's taking place that has the

[01:59:38.940 --> 01:59:44.000]
country transfixed not because the goddamn baseballs are worth so much money but because of the

[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:49.840]
accomplishments of these guys so finally after all these still years we finally get something to be

[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:54.600]
enthusiastic about and we got a whole process the guys like this that's all they know is money money

it was all pretty chaotic it was it was friday and everybody wanted to get out of here well there were

[02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:59.500]
a lot of people in here looking at the videos and some of them implied they might want to borrow them

[02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:11.200]
so but only one person ended up borrowing them and who is that i nobody fat Joe who keeps shaking

[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:17.680]

george one on the uh this required thing yeah first of all i think i george it an admiral of job

[02:01:55.460 --> 02:02:00.940]
a bit monotone and i think he is personality i think uh i think you were all bought

[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:06.780]
upon him your personality i think he's trying to find a little bit like you as far as his uh

[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:13.400]
is uh his tone but uh did a good job for the first time i think great um another thing

[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:17.000]
i think everyone is uh about this required thing

[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:23.300]
they're being really polite because it's required in soza as far as giving them back the ball

[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:27.880]

[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:12.660]
line here's a mobile in Miami hello hi Neil yes sir hi i have a take on the umgoir sixty one

[02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:16.880]
six two balls for sale uh-huh i think they definitely should take the money and if i listen

[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:21.600]
hear me out you take three million dollars from somebody who very wealthy you take all that money

[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:26.620]
and you donate to charity some aguiers and charities of your choice you pay and if you have

[02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:32.460]
if you're just a minute didn't he already donate a million dollars cash to a charity for abused kids

[02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:36.220]
sure but why not doing more money to get the money yeah okay why don't they know i'd

[02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:39.440]
some more donate this okay the people that are looking for the money for and i'm looking to give

[02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:45.100]
it a charity you jackass yeah take the money and give it take what money that's the point there

[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:51.320]
isn't any money unless people demand money and let me say it again in 1961 a guy that caught Roger

[02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:56.920]
merriss's 61st on running Yankee Stadium took it to him after the game and gave it to him and

[02:05:56.920 --> 02:06:01.800]
merriss handed it back and said get whatever you can for it kid and the guy got five thousand dollars for it

[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:07.440]
but he brought the ball back and wasn't looking for anything but here we are 37 years later

[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:12.540]
and that's all we know we got we got to squeeze some money out of these people okay somehow some way

[02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:17.260]
and let me say it for the hundredth time that the people involved in baseball the owners and

[02:06:17.260 --> 02:06:21.660]
everybody connected with it should be done in our hands and knees kissing Sammy Sosa and Mark

[02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:26.480]
McGuire both on every cheek of their back dance right for bringing some interest back and making

[02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:30.980]
this excitement with an otherwise a terminal deadly boring sport that's what they ought to be doing

[02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:34.860]
after they slapped the public in the puts four years ago with that stupid strike

[02:06:37.900 --> 02:06:43.760]
here's your lady mobile in deer field hello yes meh yes man I totally agree with you about the

[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:49.780]
baseball thing they should give it back it's not their accomplishment why do they want to sell off

[02:06:49.780 --> 02:06:56.100]
something that's not there as he hits more home runs the prior ones become worthless the only

[02:06:56.100 --> 02:07:00.560]
one they're going to be able to get money for is the one key breaks the record that's a good point

[02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:05.860]
and it should go into the hall of fame yeah I heard a suggestion made somewhere I don't know if it

[02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:11.540]
was here I was up in Philly for the weekend and God forbid that they should take the picture of

[02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:17.220]
the person who touched the ball and put it in the hall of fame that'll be their 15 minutes of

[02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:24.560]
fame isn't that ridiculous but you know why a million dollars for a baseball come on even

[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:30.380]
even look why I was like I'm not paying for it it's it's not it it's ridiculous my accomplishment the

[02:07:30.380 --> 02:07:36.920]
ball is his not not only that but like I'm sure that somewhere in Cooperstown and baseball hall of fame

[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:42.960]
they've got a baseball representing the 61st baseball at Roger Maris you know the 61st

[02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:48.060]
home run who knows if it's the real baseball who's not in my look one baseball looks like all the

[02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:53.800]
other ones well they decided they're going to produce special balls that one of wire hits it's

[02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:59.940]
numbered or it has his name on it so nobody can come forward say I caught the ball each time he

[02:07:59.940 --> 02:08:05.740]
comes up now they have a special set of balls for him they have a special set of balls yeah wow

[02:08:05.740 --> 02:08:11.120]
it's a side point but they've developed they have made these balls and they have a certain insignia

[02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:17.780]
on them that when he hits if he hits one out they'll know that it is the one he hit and he should

[02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:21.800]
get was like on drugs they were stoned out of their mind which is why most people want to go there

[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:30.940]
they got the good stuff here's big pine key hello yes yes sir I for the self-appointed critics regarding

[02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:37.840]
George stellar performance yeah I don't know if anybody remembers when Adam was on for Rick and

[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:46.020]
I never realized I forgotten about that I tried to put it out of my memory well I never realized

[02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:52.680]
until I saw you on TV what's involved with that job yeah I mean it looks like one of the hardest

[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:58.180]
jobs it's there and talk for four hours let me put it to this way it's a stressful four hours

[02:08:58.180 --> 02:09:04.080]
it would be a good way to describe it you can't hide it it you can see that you're it's a stressful

[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:11.420]
job so kudos to George's stellar performance right regarding Rick Sanchez's account yeah

[02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:19.000]
uh lariope and plant material I'm a miserable rich at Shoe opera I've been doing this for 30 years

[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:27.680]
plant prices the price of a lariope back in 1973 was about two dollars you know it is now about three

[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:35.360]
dollars I mean this guy I mean oh what kind of a he's four nursery in nursery they're just

[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:39.820]
barely hanging on by their teeth now bokeh brown was telling me lariope is also called monkey grass

[02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:47.380]
is that correct yeah wouldn't that be perfect for Rick Sanchez's house yeah perfect sounds good to me

[02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:50.980]
and here he's bitching about the fact that this guy's trying to squeeze a couple of box

[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:55.240]
profit and he's looking for a channel seven discount I'll give him a channel seven discount

[02:09:55.240 --> 02:10:02.100]
don't trusty dollars the price of the plant if not I mean and and I'm speaking for all the

[02:10:02.100 --> 02:10:09.340]
weed pullers out there that call them to installation contractors uh or landscapers uh where weed

[02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:14.000]
baggots and and that's it I mean there's no money and I don't know why I've been doing I because I'm

[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.800]
brainless I'm sure but uh maybe the plant the price of plants has not

[02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:26.360]
for somebody to ask for a quantity discount pretty embarrassing I think the word you're looking for

[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:30.520]

before his career is over at least 700 oh months I don't have any idea how many he's got

[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:47.060]
yeah like I think close to 400 I guess does he well you know he's got a long way to go for seven

[02:11:47.060 --> 02:11:50.860]
hundred that's why I'm asking these guys what 35 years old maybe he could play another four or

[02:11:50.860 --> 02:11:56.340]
five years yeah four or five times and I have no chance even if if he had 50 year for four years

[02:11:56.340 --> 02:12:02.220]
that's 200 more I know exactly it's uh it takes it takes many many years of consistent the hitting 40

all right now first of all he has four hundred and forty eight home runs no chance then

[02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:29.580]
all right one more question he's got a chance at seven hundred and fifteen home runs I don't

[02:12:29.580 --> 02:12:35.140]
depends if you know you say if he plays for his forty five fifty till he's one he has forty five or

[02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:40.680]

[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:43.960]
in the stands and the guy doesn't want to give it back to anybody he just wants to he doesn't want

[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:48.760]
to sell it either yeah he wants to keep it and what about that what about it you know

[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:54.280]
it's the you know title to that why not of course I mean he could take the home there's nothing

[02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:59.480]
that forces him to give it back uh what and another thing would have you know my guard goes

[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:07.540]
to those slump and uh he's got a hit 62 yeah what about it then I guess he didn't uh hit 62

[02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:21.000]
60 on the 18 t line I'll tell you one thing too bad that they don't do like it wriggly field

[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:25.640]
every time the opposing team uh hits all them run they throw the ball back you talk about starting

[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:32.320]
an immediate riot can you see that hits number 62 night right there in the first inning in St. Louis

[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:36.260]

[02:13:36.260 --> 02:13:43.540]
throws it back on the field 47,000 people come pouring out of the stands mass grab ass ride

[02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:49.140]
out there running the goddamn field at Bush Stadium here's a mobile in Miami hello

[02:13:49.140 --> 02:13:55.540]
nail yes sir good afternoon sir how are you great uh call it the chain through the taxes uh and I want to

[02:13:55.540 --> 02:14:02.620]
kind of express this a last year I told my vehicle one of my cars and I'm told uh actually about

[02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:07.280]
five six thousand dollars under the value in the book how much I know that I love five six thousand

[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:12.220]
I told the car for the Volkswagen in 94 for about eight thousand dollars worth about 13 to four

[02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:18.960]
shapes I paid the sales I will actually I told it to the individual and uh they contacted me

[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:24.880]
about too much later from the State Department or actually Department of uh taxes and said that

[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:30.920]
I underpaid due to the fact that I sold the car for way less than it was in the book and I argued

[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:35.220]
that I basically told them to look this is a price that I wanted some well I didn't pay that they

[02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:40.160]
finally sent me three or four notices I'm gonna paint over two hundred dollars in late payments

[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:44.740]
on the difference is about three or four hundred dollars to believe me they could do whatever

[02:14:44.740 --> 02:14:50.580]
so in other words they just make up this new scan that you have to do what they they have a book

[02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:54.780]
and they go by what the book is yeah well let me ask you this what does their books say about a

[02:14:54.780 --> 02:14:59.600]
baseball yeah that's true what I'm saying they're telling you how do you determine what fair

[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:04.700]
market value is for a baseball that's involved in and breaking some kind of a statistical record

[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:08.240]
you're absolutely right just aren't you just how can they determine what I want to sell my car

[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:14.960]
right that's what I can't do it sounds like fascism to me and they get so taxual and I had to pay

[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:20.400]
the LLC and I had to pay the interest and the tax so you get screwed either welcome to America sir

[02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:26.180]
thank you dorsavidanya wow how do you like that and I thought they were cleaning out the guy

[02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:30.860]
damn IRS doesn't sound like it to me sure for nodding him that's like robin hood yeah that's right

[02:15:30.860 --> 02:15:34.240]
little man that's right and giving it to the guy damn government again so we can waste all the

[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:37.980]
money on screwing around and then Burton can to go make some more illegitimate kids and I still want

[02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:43.460]

[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:52.200]
jail and is called a president of scumbag we finally bring his ass out of the closet he's got

[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:56.040]
an illegitimate kid that he fathered back in the early 80s who's a teenager now

[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:03.520]

let me tell you pal the only balls you're gonna catch are in your mouth okay you're not catching

[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:35.940]
old baseball because the game is insane Lewis they're not playing any more games here this year

[02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:44.020]
it's everyone so on now I want you to understand if I were in a position if I were happy to be in

[02:18:44.020 --> 02:18:47.560]
the stands and I caught the ball you're damn right I'd take the million dollars if somebody was

[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:52.080]
stupid enough to offer it to me that's not the point you want to give me a million dollars okay

[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:58.280]
thank you small bills please but the point is that there are some people including these kids who

[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:03.120]
have got different set of values and attitudes about it and then they're saying no way and the only

[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:07.200]
thing we're hearing about in regards to this except for maybe two or three other calls is that

[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:11.080]
you know how much is the goddamn ball worth how much is this worth how much is that worth

[02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:17.940]
I'll tell you how much more to those calls are worth here's West Palm Beach hello hello Neil

[02:19:17.940 --> 02:19:24.940]
yes sir how you doing great I couldn't agree with you more it's just I believe what it is our society is

[02:19:24.940 --> 02:19:29.600]
so money hungry obsessed they're just like sick it's like a neurosis with these people that

[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:34.280]
when something like this does happen they're so shocked and you know what I mean no I don't

[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:39.460]
they're shocked that these kids have the why did I see when when somebody is this mercenary is

[02:19:39.460 --> 02:19:47.180]
there yeah and you know like yourself if I caught the ball I would get the money sure but it's

[02:19:47.180 --> 02:19:53.100]
great and it's a breath of fresh air to see the kids and especially down it four of them were hit

[02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:57.200]
in Miami and and these people are saying oh well these kids are they're just kids you know they're

[02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:01.940]
being misled and years from now I mean well maybe they were years from now say gee if I had to do

[02:20:01.940 --> 02:20:06.060]
it again but in the meantime they're not doing it that's true it's such a breath of fresh air

[02:20:06.060 --> 02:20:09.980]
and these assholes are just jealous they're just they're just psychotic wishing that they were

[02:20:09.980 --> 02:20:14.140]
the ones out there tromping around in centerfield getting the baseball so they could have some claim

[02:20:14.140 --> 02:20:19.540]
to fame you know I think the baseball players should take some advice from the kids I mean I got

[02:20:19.540 --> 02:20:23.040]
some money stashed away and it's not because I caught a baseball sometime in my life it's because

[02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:26.820]
I worked for it that's that's what it's supposed to be all about and I run around trying to

[02:20:26.820 --> 02:20:34.100]
cash in on souvenirs Neil one more complaint I have yes sir have you noticed lately especially

[02:20:34.100 --> 02:20:40.900]
here in West Palm Beach maybe in Miami nobody if you go to like a drive-through or something nobody says

[02:20:40.900 --> 02:20:45.040]
thank you nobody says have a good day anymore all right what's wrong with that well that's because

[02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:49.500]
this is South Florida it's unbelievable you're just catching on to that you go anywhere else it's

[02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:52.600]
completely different that's right I was away I was in Toronto over the weekend you get in the

[02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:55.980]
elevator with strangers good morning and whatever you walked on the hallway there's the

[02:20:55.980 --> 02:20:59.480]
maid you never saw before in your life uh good morning I mean really people just being

[02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:03.020]
friendly or nearly people not here is noticing more and more that's why the last time I heard

[02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:06.860]
somebody say have a nice day was when Sandy Peyton opened an ambitious will and got all been

[02:21:06.860 --> 02:21:13.200]
other show unreal and Neil how do we get what uh 69 in West Palm Beach with a good antenna all right

[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:17.800]
good luck pal how do they get whammy up there they're all seeing that thing on whammy we can't get any

[02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:22.920]
numbers out of that station even mash can't even squeeze out of I think they got squiggly lines his

[02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:27.460]
last time I check they got just little squiggly lines because people said not that Alan Alder again

[02:21:27.460 --> 02:21:33.740]
fat not that damn McLean Stevenson how many bombs did he have there's a guy how many different

[02:21:33.740 --> 02:21:37.500]
series the now seriously what do you have like 75 different series that they try to make a TV

[02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:42.820]
star out of McLean Stevenson did anyone want to pan out no how about Jamie far like I said the other

[02:21:42.820 --> 02:21:46.540]
they since the quiz shows went off don't see him no more and what do they have it on like four

[02:21:46.540 --> 02:21:54.180]
times a night on whammy as often as possible as often as the law allows here's the North Miami hello

[02:21:55.940 --> 02:22:04.120]
yeah yes sir Neil yes a about this ball business ball business yeah with my water uh-huh everybody

[02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:08.520]
should be able to do whatever they want to do that's what I said that's right so what the hell if

[02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:11.820]
you want to get the ball back fine if I got it I will take the money for it and not only that but

[02:22:11.820 --> 02:22:15.720]
this is such a tremendous accomplishment is this all we got to talk about is how much money

[02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:19.740]
people are going to get for the baseball why are people even worried about this it's good

[02:22:19.740 --> 02:22:24.480]
that someone our principal still all right but you have money this kid don't have money if I was

[02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:28.440]
if I was a kid I think the money but he that's what he's choosing not that's right it's up to him it's

[02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:34.180]
a free goddamn country there you go amen uh-huh see uh-huh what do you say uh-huh that's what I

[02:22:34.180 --> 02:22:39.200]
thought he said he's right he's absolutely correct all these people will stay and then not only

[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:43.720]
that but somebody told me a long time ago don't be a goddamn yanta okay what are you sticking

[02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:47.180]
your nose would you you're gonna get something out of it no no got a little commission coming out

[02:22:47.180 --> 02:22:50.560]
of it no what don't y'all worried and bet out a shape of a one the kids got money or not

[02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:56.400]
enjoy the moment you know soak in the excitement okay course the problem like I said before is

[02:22:56.400 --> 02:23:01.040]
that element of people they're not sports fans they don't root for teams all they do is make a god damn

[02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:04.600]
bett and if they can't catch a bet they don't give a flying crap about any of the rest of this

[02:23:06.020 --> 02:23:10.440]
if all yeah I'll tell you right now you cannot hockey all you want but is there anybody out there

[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:13.740]
with a grandma center if there's not gambling it goes on but is there anybody out there with

[02:23:13.740 --> 02:23:18.980]
brains that bets a lot of money on a hockey game no of course not people who are fans are

[02:23:18.980 --> 02:23:22.700]
certain of the sports they go there because they love the sport but like football they took all

[02:23:22.700 --> 02:23:26.660]
the illegal gambling out of college and professional football you think we'd ever see another game no

[02:23:26.660 --> 02:23:32.260]
there you go so let's get serious let's draw the line between people are really sports fans or

[02:23:32.260 --> 02:23:36.200]
people are like getting sucked in this because of the excitement of the moment and the occasion

[02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:41.280]
as opposed to those people are nothing but a bunch of chronic neurotic gamblers who can't sleep

[02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:46.880]
at night because they just lost the guy damn mortgage money Hollywood would pen question mark

[02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:51.840]
cello if we find an award for a game this year is what yeah we found me if I'm gonna win 40 games

[02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:56.640]
this year right that's not like Andy from Hollywood didn't it Andy from Hollywood let's hear it

[02:23:56.640 --> 02:24:00.480]
we didn't want his facts before even though we tried to compliment George yours and no thank you I

[02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:05.240]
consider the source you an asshole so Andy from Hollywood has to get his call in here even

[02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:09.380]
else almost hockey season I told him when hockey season starts it's only a couple of weeks away

[02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:13.500]
in a one of a few days away before we open camp with no goldpender by the way

[02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:20.020]
but Andy from Hollywood but I'm glad he mentioned that leave on god his brains bettered out there again

[02:24:20.020 --> 02:24:24.240]
give up nine runs or something like that in four and a third of things hey Andy you think leave on

[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:29.960]
it's gonna win 40 games this year I got to do it we'll be lucky to win 50 games this year they

[02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:35.000]
only got about 20 to go but be that as it may so wonder what so what do we solve here today we

[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:35.620]
decided George
