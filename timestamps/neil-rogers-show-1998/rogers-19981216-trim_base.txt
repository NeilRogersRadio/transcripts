[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.040]
The opinions of Neil, his guests call his or-

[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.100]
Anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisitions

[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.860]
or the Beasley Broadcast Group.

[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.920]
Now, Neil Rogers on Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.360]
It puts a large in the basket.

[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.160]
You know kids, everybody at the park, it's no big thing.

[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.400]
It's something natural.

[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.660]
Your parts are made of five cats.

[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.160]
Night-distance oxygen, carabass, hydrogen, and everything.

[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.080]
And everybody has to park some time kids.

[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.560]
That's why we should all sing this song.

[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.340]
Be free, some useful fruits, the violin, the violin.

[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.220]
Oh, you're too.

[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.420]
The violin's beautiful.

[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.220]
The panicking of three songs.

[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.460]
It's your thing.

[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.460]
It's in for me.

[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.600]
What is that?

[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.160]
It's something really exciting when I hit that.

[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.120]
Can I try that one more time just to make sure that it's probably one more time.

[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.300]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.260]
Okay, just checking.

[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.400]
Okay, I want to make sure that they heard it because that gets us off to a great start.

[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.960]
I'm, you know, before I say anything here today, I'm scrolling through this morning

[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.820]
and I'm finding just perfect for the holidays because I want to play a lot of stuff

[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.960]
that we don't need to play every day or every week or like in a long time.

[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.160]
And I found I discovered something.

[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.140]
We've never played this here, by the way.

[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.200]
And I'm sure a lot more entertaining than hearing these assholes.

[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.120]
Oh, Danny, listen, Jimmy, that, and Jimmy, this, oh, God.

[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.420]
Like I told you this morning, it's like that scene in a clockwork orange

[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.800]
where they got him locked up in that room up in the upstairs.

[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.660]
And the Beethoven music is blasting and the speakers are bouncing off the walls.

[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.340]
Danny, listen, Jimmy, that, and Jimmy, and Danny, and oh, God.

[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.180]
Like I said, this is a lot more entertaining even if you mean I'm a little bit...

[00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.020]
Well, Buffalo has a football team, the greatest in the land.

[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.480]
And everybody thinks that's great.

[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.360]
I say really hard.

[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.420]
The Buffalo Phil's not enough for what, see what I mean?

[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.320]
So just sing a little bit.

[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.740]
When you say Miami, when you say Buffalo, and you're that Buffalo Bills, Buffalo Bills,

[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.060]
the greatest team in the history of human race, data, Buffalo Bills.

[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.540]
Are you sure?

[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.040]
The greatest in the land, since sliced bread and canned beer.

[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.220]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.340]
And your chance up that redneck stuff, illicit that banjo.

[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.680]
Holy sweet God, listen to that.

[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.320]
When you say Buffalo Bills, it don't sound so redneck, you do it.

[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.500]
Everybody's singing along now.

[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.780]
Are you Bill Fad? Here we go.

[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.700]
Well, the Buffalo Bills, that are best teams.

[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.940]
They have the best record over the last five years.

[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.840]
And they went to the Super Bowl four times, which is what I can say for this,

[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.900]
since it comes to confusion.

[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.260]
And they're at the greatest.

[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.860]
Because I believe like that uniforms, they share his health, beats their heck.

[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.440]
I have have enough fish on the helmet, cuz they're that Buffalo homebills.

[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.160]
The best football team, what I ever seen,

[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.120]
they're history of my life, they are the Buffalo Bills.

[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.160]
The Buffalo Bills, the homogen, telling the greatest quarterfacin' to leave me.

[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.820]
Yeah, everybody, the Buffalo Bills, they're the Buffalo Bills.

[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.460]
And they've been around longer than the stinking rotten fish.

[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.360]
Well, they're the Buffalo Bills.

[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.360]
Buffalo Bills.

[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.980]
I'm going to play a track.

[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.360]
But you rather have as a pet, a Buffalo or a fish.

[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.000]
Yes, that's the Buffalo Bills.

[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.540]
What is a Buffalo Bills?

[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.320]
Bills fights on.

[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.540]
Well, that's what he was going to say, but whoever put that in the DCS chopped it off.

[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.760]
I can't imagine who that might have been, Robert.

[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.480]
But at any rate, we did the best we can.

[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.180]
Nice going, Airfield. Are you sure positive?

[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.780]
So anyway, let's see, the QA and Van today is going to be out at the pizza-loft plaza.

[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.500]
Is he going to be sitting up like right into plaza there, right behind Pier 1 Imports out?

[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.660]
Be good, there's lots of parking there.

[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.120]
Maybe we'll get you a few extra customers for lunch today.

[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.100]
Raise $2,100 in Coral Springs yesterday.

[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.640]
Oh, right. Let's hear it for Coral Springs, baby.

[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.960]
They'd be the best up there.

[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.980]
So we'll see if we can outdo that.

[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.160]
$88,096 plus whatever, maybe Carol will call you one of these days from center one.

[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.500]
Huh? You think she might call it because her fax machine, it's working on the outgoing,

[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.660]
but on the in-going, we got some kind of a problem here.

[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.060]
Because the construction goes on and on and on.

[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.140]
It goes and where it stops.

[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.100]
Nobody knows.

[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.700]
And as a result, they're diddling around in here.

[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.020]
The phone company may have done this and they may have done that and that sort of and so on.

[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.300]
So why don't think we can get any faxes.

[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.820]
But maybe Carol will actually call you like sometime this week and we'll get up to date like from last week.

[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.200]
Because I'm positive over 90 grand right now.

[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.400]
Which doesn't mean that people should like slack off and stop helping us out because we want to make sure we get over that 100 grand total.

[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.080]
Got the big game that I paid me.

[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.520]
We got, oh, it's speaking of that.

[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.660]
I don't hang stuff on today.

[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.260]
Because what is the reason for that is you just taking a day off or is it because it's got something to do with Hanukkah because it's right in the middle of it.

[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.000]
Who's Shambi will be here at two o'clock.

[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.140]
Then we got Kimba at six.

[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.620]
We got the Panthers pregame at seven to Panthers in the Penguin at the 7th or even night.

[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:21.000]
I'm driving home yesterday and I heard Hank say that I was wrong about the Edgar went through real thing and Hank usually got the inside information.

[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.360]
And it would be the first time that I was wrong like when we got stuck in by Paul Harvey Jr. on the John Henry deal.

[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.120]
Which by the way, John Henry did buy the Marlins.

[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.320]
They were a little bit premature evaluation, but nevertheless we got stuck in on that deal.

[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.620]
But interesting enough, all the other columnists that you read, even the anxious Greg Kotex in a hero this morning, basically are saying the same thing that I did.

[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:52.100]
And that even if they did get a couple of real good prospects and even if the deal was made because Edgar and a real was a bad guy and he didn't show up at the Christmas party or whatever the reason was, he wasn't going to the clubhouse.

[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.860]
It still smells of the same thing.

[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.940]
It's still the same smell of a rotting fish.

[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.060]
As in rotting Marlin rotting whatever kind of fish you want to put in fill in the blank.

[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.000]
And the fans, whatever number may be left are going to just say, we're not buying this.

[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.860]
Because it's like a cleansing experience.

[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.800]
Let's give everybody who might have been on that championship team two years ago and really piss off the fans and make up a good story in the song and a dance.

[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.560]
And I'm afraid that Hank got you know, stuck into the propaganda on that.

[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.840]
And as long as I'm responding to some of the stuff that was said yesterday, no, they're not the apathas and not having a suffering from poor attendance.

[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:32.320]
In fact, we do have 2000 unsolved seats for night's game, but nevertheless we've been averaging well over 17,000 a game for the home games.

[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:41.640]
Any other joint holds over 19,000, but when you're averaging over 17,000, how many did they have in Pittsburgh last night for the Penguin three two overtime went against Tampa Bay at 11,000 in some odd.

[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:49.800]
And the typical in the igloo in Pittsburgh where they're like desperate for cash where every empty seat is like a stake to the heart of that franchise.

[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.640]
So it's not the problem of the attendance, but the guy that called in yesterday in Hank show was absolutely correct.

[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.020]
There's no passion. They get up and they leave and then I find out they were leaving in the fourth quarter of the football game on Sunday night.

[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:09.320]
In that pivotal jets game that everybody was on their hands and knees and waiting with their tongues down to their puppets waiting for weeks for that event.

[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:18.640]
Would like two minutes left in the game that were still in it and they were like was 14 to 10 and make that miraculous comeback and more it not for that fumble running for the touchdown.

[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:27.500]
If they wouldn't try to get off that play before the two minute warning, who knows what would have happened and there were thousands of people leaving and evacuating like they had a bomb scare at the B.B. Park in the fourth quarter.

[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.980]
See, that's just the way the so called fans are in this town. There's no real passion. They talk a good game.

[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:40.620]
At least the football fans talk a good game. The hockey fans didn't even talk a big. They don't talk any game because they don't have any material to talk about because they don't even know the names.

[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:47.860]
As soon as the B's are left, that was basically it. They don't know the name is anybody. We do know Dean because I heard him this morning. How you doing Dean?

[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:56.180]
He's okay in our book. Keep him healthy. Okay. Keep giving him those valuable pills and keep him in shape because we need Dino badly, but other than that.

[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.960]
Other than Dino and Ray Whitney, we got real tourists, baby.

[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:10.140]
So we got that big income of 730 tonight. I'm sure that there'll be some people there. Maybe even some people bring by some checks for center one. I'll be there in my usual seats section 101.

[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.900]
I'll be sitting there waiting for your cash and checks and whatever else you got money orders.

[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:23.740]
And in the meantime, all of a sudden, and all these years, haven't I been telling you? And they laughed at me. They laughed. Oh, he's really funny that Nio, you know, but he sure exaggerates.

[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:35.360]
The threat of a bloodless coup by the right wing by these far-bisoned by these maniac right wing lunatics in this country. You could smell of coming. You could smell it. That's right.

[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:46.500]
And all of a sudden, just after the November elections, when everybody thought this impeachment thing didn't have a chance in hell and it was going away and they got the message. And did they get the message? No, of course not.

[00:08:47.100 --> 00:09:04.860]
All of a sudden somebody decided, hey, guess what? We got the votes, baby. And while we still got the votes in this Congress right now before the new year, let's rush this thing through there and let's everybody put on these phony speeches and proof in the pudding being that E-Clay Shaw office yesterday in the last couple of days inundated with phone calls,

[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:16.880]
asked over a thousand phone calls, emails and faxes yesterday. And you know what? Nio, overwhelming majority, by the way, against impeachment, but Shaw announced yesterday he plans to vote in favor of impeachment like most of his colleagues.

[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:24.900]
So in other words, they don't really care what you think or how many parades you hold or how many demonstrations or how many phone calls or how many faxes or how many emails.

[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:36.960]
Because just coincidentally, all of the same time, as if there was some new information that we just learned which we did not during any of the how judiciary committee, there was no information whatsoever. That was new.

[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:47.300]
But all of a sudden they just got this great revelation that the perjury constituted impeachable offense and they're going to vote to impeach and they're going to throw it over to the Senate and they're going to drag us through month of this bull crept.

[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:57.860]
And now of course, we even in limbo, they're waiting for Ramadan this Sunday and over there the Arabs. So if we're going to bomb Saddam, you know, we'd have to do it before Sunday or otherwise we'd piss off all the other countries.

[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:06.280]
But in the meantime, if we do that, then they're going to say, aha, look at this right on the even impeachment right now. Here we go. It's another diversionary tactic by all president.

[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:13.960]
So basically they're going to tie the hands of the whole goddamn government in every respect for months now in spite of what the people think they don't give a crap what you think.

[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:20.760]
Because they're a bunch of fascist lunatics and they are taking over the whole goddamn country. So I get down to the passport office if I were you today.

[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.840]
Come on, it's after 10 at 560 WQ.

[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.920]
I don't want to see that smelly home.

[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:59.980]
300 pounds of peace be putt and I'm hoisting that bitch on us. Everybody had enough of that big fat noise.

[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.800]
I don't really care about who she blows.

[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.680]
What else can we say about her everyday?

[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.120]
Just think that it's no way that she's that cold.

[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.020]
We got to go to the cold.

[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.920]
We got to go to the cold.

[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.800]
We got to go to the cold.

[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:34.380]
Don't want to hear a voice in real about her foot and her movie feels just a cold.

[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.260]
I don't want to hear a voice in real about her foot and her movie feels just a cold.

[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.900]
I don't want to hear a voice in real about her foot and her movie feels just a cold.

[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.440]
Yeah, they love the country.

[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600]
They will fall in love with this security.

[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:56.120]
Everybody will have what's in the holiday mood and they're busy with their Hanukkah and Christmas and with their New Year's and with their parties and Thanksgiving in between.

[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.180]
And all of a sudden when everybody was kind of like nodding off saying, okay, we did the election thing.

[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.820]
A few people actually went out and voted.

[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.240]
They shocked their crap out of people.

[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.160]
They got rid of Al the motto and a bunch of other Nazis.

[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.880]
And guess what?

[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:08.700]
Did it work?

[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.040]
No.

[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.640]
And just from nowhere all of a sudden, and like I said, it does make any difference.

[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.740]
I could sit here and give us back numbers and phone numbers and talk about that big demonstration.

[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.140]
They're having an affordable holiday all tonight.

[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.740]
And what's the point?

[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.080]
You have to look beyond that because it's very obvious.

[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.520]
They don't care what you people think.

[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.080]
They don't care what anybody thinks.

[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:39.060]
And they have just miraculously inspired all that testimony by all of those constitutional scholars who said there wasn't a lawyer in America who would prosecute this perjury case.

[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.240]
But all of a sudden they've come to the same conclusion that this is an impeachable offense.

[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.360]
It rises to that level of high crimes in this demeanors that the founding fathers had in mind, which clearly it does not.

[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.780]
Especially when you look at the context of what it has to do with.

[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.040]
See, this is what the right wing is famous for.

[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:02.820]
If they can't catch you on anything else, it's always a sexting because you can get almost anybody in this country, men especially on a sexting.

[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.360]
There you go.

[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.080]
So if we couldn't get them on file gate, we couldn't get them on white water.

[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.820]
They couldn't get them on travel gates. They couldn't get them on bubble gates.

[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.380]
They couldn't get them on anything else.

[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.700]
Under pearly gates.

[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.900]
But oh, we got that sexting baby. So let's run with that.

[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.760]
You know, and this business about he said in Israel the day that he didn't commit perjury.

[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.080]
You know, he said that he misled the people. Now, what do they want?

[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.860]
How many different ways does this man have to apologize?

[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.580]
Would they like to have a Jimmy Swaggerd, a careful, they want to get him on his hands and knees in front of the Congress there?

[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.800]
And do one of those Jimmy Swaggerd deals full with a hanky and a whole bit in the tears flowing?

[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.420]
This man has apologized.

[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.240]
Of course he was lying about his sexual pecker dillos.

[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.780]
And of course this bitch, you know, all of a sudden changed her tune.

[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:55.520]
Is this crazy bitch who admittedly went there with her presidential knee pads and dressed provocatively

[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.960]
who was leading him on and got what she was looking for at least in part.

[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.840]
But then when all of a sudden she realized that he wasn't going to leave Hillary and sweep her off her feet

[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.100]
and take her off to Disneyland or wherever it was going to be.

[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.460]
All of a sudden the whole goddamn government comes crumbling down because of some crazy bitch

[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.800]
and her two conspirators and crime Lucian Goldberg and Linda Trep, of course.

[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.460]
And all her illegally done recordings, tape recordings.

[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.120]
And the media, of course, doodifully keeps reporting all of this stuff as if it makes sense, which it does not.

[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.060]
It's as if we have convenient Alzheimer's again.

[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.080]
And we're supposed to forget all the hours and hours and days and weeks over the last 12 months now

[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.600]
that we've been treated to, like we didn't hear any of that.

[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.320]
Just like these moderate Republicans they call them.

[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:45.320]
They're just the Nazis in drag. That's all. They're just manipulated and owned, lock stuck in Burl by the radical right wing in a Republican party.

[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.540]
Just like they learned something new from these hearings. There wasn't anything new there.

[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.660]
It was the same story that was concocted before back in January when he said I held up the finger.

[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:01.720]
I did not have sex. I had my bye bye. I didn't have sexual relations. All I'm down the line.

[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.520]
To cover up a few blow jobs in a White House. That's what we're talking about.

[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.140]
And this constitutes an impeachable offense. Oh, well, he can't be above this.

[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.100]
See, well, you don't understand if the president can go out and if he were driving a car, which presidents don't drive cars,

[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.140]
but if he were, he could like, you know, do a drunk driving routine.

[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.280]
And be accused of manslaughter. That would not be an impeachable offense.

[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.700]
He could get in this car and go out and kill somebody. And it would not be an impeachable offense.

[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.660]
It would be a crime, but not an impeachable offense. It's not a crime against the government.

[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.980]
And all of these people putting on this big act, and that's all it is, man.

[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.280]
It should get like Academy Awards for each one of these guys.

[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.760]
Putting on this big song and a dance like they're really concerned about the implications of the Constitution

[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.760]
that upholding the lawful crap. Horse crap.

[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.000]
In addition to which the Paula Jones case has been settled, it was already thrown out of court.

[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.660]
It was settled before the appeal could be heard. And that said, it's over with the history.

[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:08.940]
And there wasn't a single shred of evidence, by the way, in that case, that there was anything done to this bitch

[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.660]
that prevented her from the, as far as job discrimination, it didn't exist. Sexual harassment.

[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.440]
She didn't get flowers on secretaries there, whatever was. That was her version of sexual harassment.

[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.540]
So we got to some bitch that pissed off because she had a big nose and she didn't get flowers on secretaries day.

[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:30.220]
And we got some other bitch who would have presidential knee pads, who had 600 pounds now, who went there, gave a few blow jobs.

[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.660]
And that's what we're going to bring the government down about. That's the best they could do with their 50 or 60 million dollars that they spent.

[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.600]
And they still can't convince the majority of the people that this is legitimate.

[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.920]
And they still got to go ahead and do it tomorrow and Friday.

[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:50.220]
So it's very obvious to me that you can make all the goddamn phone calls, and send the telegrams, and the emails.

[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.980]
And you can demonstrate, and you can march, and you can protest. And they still don't care.

[00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:02.800]
So that should tell you right there what this is all about. They know better than you do. They know better than all the American people what you do.

[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:09.540]
They know better than all those constitutional scholars that they had testified before them last two weeks. They know better than them.

[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:16.300]
And all these below me, these guys that come under, oh, this is the most gut-wrenching difficult decision of my life.

[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:21.920]
If I dread the day, but I mean, I'll give me a break already. Okay. 20 years for overacting for some of these guys.

[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:35.880]
The most difficult day of their freaking lives. The worst example of partisan politics and the country and the economy and the world can be damned is basically what they're saying to us.

[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:44.600]
Of this grace. And like I said, they cut every, they've cut the whole country with sleeping, sleeping at the switch.

[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:57.220]
And isn't it interesting that they, that there was such a big hurry now, such an urgency that they couldn't wait to carry over to the next Congress, or the Democrats have five more seats, because that might be too close.

[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.320]
They just might not be able to sneak it through there.

[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.220]
Here's a lady in Miami Beach. Hello. Yes, man.

[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.640]
Yeah, new. This is Sally. Yes, Sally.

[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:20.680]
Yeah, you're inspiring just really. You're right on target. Oh, thank God. There's someone like you that sees the reality.

[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.220]
And I have an article I want to read to you. Oh, no, I don't want you to read me an article. So I want to read about John Glenn.

[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:35.940]
I won't read. I'll just tell you that they sent him out there for patriotic and all the way array array and for nothing.

[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.420]
Yeah. And they have to do with anything, Sally. We already know that.

[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.160]
No, it has to do. We wanted to find out if an old fart.

[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:51.120]
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, the fart out in space. But what it has to do with they don't answer public what they want. They just go ahead and kill it.

[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.100]
Okay, Sally. Well, so you have a great life and say 100 Senator Glenn.

[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.000]
Open line in Broward, all three and date five six seven, oh five, 50, pound five, 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:05.740]
Here on a great Wednesday. Is it a great day for the Irish? No, for the Jewish? No, for the glam? No, no.

[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:13.920]
In birsen showdown. Oh, look at this. Replacing, investigating the president. Now it's showdown with Iraq that they have on CNN.

[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:22.440]
How can there be a showdown and say do we feel that just maybe Saddam knows that he's got this country over a barrel now?

[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:29.680]
Huh? Huh? Maybe he just realizes that it's a total, totally impossible situation.

[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.000]
Remember a couple of months ago when they were going to go over there and bomb the crap out of them.

[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.200]
And they were already accusing pulling the finger. Uh-huh. This is all politically motivated.

[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:45.380]
You're trying to investigate. You're trying to divert attention. So you can imagine now on the eve of the impeachment vote in the house.

[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:55.680]
They got their hands tied. They got a bound and gagged. They've got your whole government taken hostage by right wing lunatics.

[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:05.860]
Who hate Bill Clinton like poison, just like most of the people on the media, by the way, hate him like poison like Sam Donaldson and Kookie Roberts.

[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.800]
And it got them. Frank says no there. I'm CNN. Who the hell is he for?

[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:17.240]
I remember that night that they had that town hall meeting many, many months ago when we were first being treated all of this bull crap day after day, night after night.

[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.220]
And he was talking about well, when all the details started coming out, that's when it really was disgusting.

[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.920]
Yeah, Frank said no. I wonder who he's been doing. Okay. I wonder who's been doing him. I wonder how many illicit affairs he's had.

[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:37.980]
Another sanctimonious phony hypocrite in the media. It was disgusting. He was actually getting blow jobs. He was having phone sex.

[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.300]
He was touching his penis. Oh my god.

[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:59.100]
They said that Andrew Johnson, by the way, used to have a hero in the White House, not just one or two bimbos. He used to have a hero in there, which is why he was impeached by the way, but nevertheless, just we add that in there is the Leicester footnote to American history.

[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:09.300]
Along with Thomas Jefferson and the slaves and if the yarn is mistress and Eisenhower and his girlfriend and Nixon and his Chinese girlfriend and George Bush and it and on and on and on and on and on it went.

[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.680]
And Kennedy, of course, I mean, Kennedy's in a whole different league. They were the experts.

[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:23.820]
They brought it to it. They brought it to a new level. They perfected screwing around in the White House or jeez at the pool every time Jackie went out of town.

[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:33.940]
Did anybody care about it? Did anybody report it? Sure, there were people that knew about it, but they had the common sense that this is nobody's god damn business. It has nothing to do with running the affairs of government.

[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:42.320]
But thank the money, a super quits like Mary Bono and Dan Coates and Henry Hyde and all these other fakers who've been screwing everything that moves.

[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:52.740]
They're sitting there making judgments. He lied, he covered up this elicit affair with this young intern and we're supposed to be justice outraged and indignant as they are.

[00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:03.420]
Very sad day boys and girls. And like I said, I'd be lined up at the passport office if I were you. If you want to do this smart thing, that's where I'd be lined up this morning right now.

[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.700]
I wouldn't be lined up to be in some telegrams to Washington because it's obvious they're not going to listen.

[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.480]
26 after 10 at 560 WQM you were a bastard.

Your concertation with him on the boat

Okay, 12.45, you do realize had it not been for the blue dress?

[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:34.680]
Had it not been for the blue dress, the DNA, the stain on the dress

[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:37.420]
We wouldn't be going through any of this right now, you realize that?

[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.500]
I just mentioned that in passing

[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:41.500]
And whose idea was it?

[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:43.060]
Get that dress to me right away

[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:47.160]
Monica's mother, the one we were supposed to feel so sorry for

[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.660]
Remember when they interrogated and they grilled her in a beater and whipped her into a bloody pop

[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:53.000]
And she came out of there looking all frisled and not too happy

[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.120]
We're supposed to feel sorry for that damn bitch

[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:59.100]
Oh, get me that dress right away, I'll keep it for ya

[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:03.240]
So then we can write the book and the movie and the screenplay

[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:05.300]
And make millions of dollars bring it down to country

[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:12.880]
We have an open line indeed, 5.6705, 50.560 on the AT&T wireless line

Okay, thank you

[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.420]
How come we don't ever get a real caller in Hi Alia?

[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:30.040]
Two open lines in day, 5.6705, 60.560

[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.800]
Maybe there are no real people in Hi Alia, I think that could be the answer

[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.120]
There are no real people in Hi Alia, there's Ronald Martinez, like I said

[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:38.600]
Here's a pompe-no, hello

[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.060]

I've been here a year, you're way behind me

[01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:59.480]
I haven't been here in two years

[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:02.880]
I was paid for seven months before that for not working

[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:03.480]

[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:04.480]
Yeah, it was

[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:07.740]
So I'm flipping around last night

[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:09.680]
And I come along with Lamy

[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.100]
And I go look at this Arnold Stang out of show

[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:15.860]
Yeah, that's an old, that Lamy thing is going to be history real soon

[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:17.120]
Yeah, those are all V runs

[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:17.820]
Oh really?

[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:20.500]
It's an A-Coli TV station, huh?

[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.460]
Did you like doing that?

[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:21.900]
Well what do you mean?

[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:22.740]
I didn't do anything

[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:25.240]
They just used to come in here and take the tape to show every day

[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.740]
And then butcher it up and put it on TV

[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:27.220]
Yeah

[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:32.320]
Well, I'm just thinking, how can this crap be happening in this country?

[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:33.700]
I don't understand this

[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:40.380]
I mean, how come we get to hear evidence that was illegally a paint?

[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:40.680]
Right

[01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:42.200]
This is nuts

[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.660]
We got a thing going on in Ontario

[01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:49.420]
Which was just settled the speaker of the house of the legislature in Ontario

[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:52.480]
With suit for sexual harassment by former employee

[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:52.860]
Right

[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:56.340]
And he slept with her a few times

[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:58.680]
And then she decided not to

[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.100]
And he said, your job's on the line

[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:01.260]
So she sued him

[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:03.900]
This goes on for months and months and months

[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:08.960]
The speaker resigns his, he doesn't resign a seat, he resigns as the speaker

[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:13.260]
But maintains his seat in the legislature

[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:13.740]
Yeah

[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:16.920]
Months and months go by and then they settle it

[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.800]
For like $600,000

[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.680]
Now get this

[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:20.040]
Yeah

[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.500]
She gets paid a quarter of a million dollars

[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:28.320]
The legislature spends a couple of hundred thousand dollars on investigating the thing

[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:33.440]
And then they give him $130,000 to pay his legal bills

[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:34.380]
There you go

[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:35.940]
Everybody gets paid

[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.080]
Nobody is guilty

[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.820]
Nobody is innocent

[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:43.740]
Nobody is nothing except the taxpayers are at 600 grand

[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.020]
Well, at least he didn't molest any kids that may believe gardens

[01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:47.120]
Okay, that's one good thing

[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:47.800]
Wasn't that something?

[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.000]
There was no Graham James either

[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:49.740]
Right

[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:51.800]
Well, they letting him out during the daytime

[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.520]
Because there's a lot of young hockey players who need some assistance

[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:55.160]
That's right

[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:55.660]
But anyway

[01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:58.180]
Anyway, it's good to hear you on the air

[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.180]
I'm glad you're here, you must own this town by now

[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:02.980]
Yeah, I own it, yeah

[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:07.680]
That's like saying that I own two pieces of beef jerky left in my bowl here

[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:09.180]
Well, listen Rob, have a great life

[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:09.740]
Thank you, man

[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:10.560]
Don't lose your passport

[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.380]
And your visa or master card

[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:14.820]
Okay, we have an open line in Broward 2 and Zade

[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:17.760]
Yeah, they can't understand it, the Canadians don't get a day

[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:19.540]
What's going on down there, eh?

[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:20.800]
What's wrong with you people?

[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.620]
Good question, we just don't want to grow up

[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:27.780]
We just refuse to grow up or hang it out of our infancy

[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:29.260]
I mean, we're tenaciously hanging on

[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:32.000]
And even the people that do want to grow up, they won't let us do it

[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:36.640]
5, 6, 7, 05, 50, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:39.900]
Are these people worked up into a frenzy in the WQM audience or what?

[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:40.120]
How?

[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:43.320]
Are they, they're worried about, next week, Scott, they're in Dolphin, Denver game

[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.280]
And that's what they're worried about

[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.460]
It puts the lotion in the basket

[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:46.800]
Right

[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:50.160]
Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale, hello

[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:51.420]
Is this me?

[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:52.160]
Yes, man

[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:55.440]
I want to know, I agree with you 100% about the media

[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.260]
And what can we do about the media?

[01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:58.280]
I try, nothing

[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:03.280]
If we don't think Scott is finding short hairs, man, they've got us where they want us

[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.020]
They're playing us like a fiddle, they're exploiting this for everything they can get

[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:08.880]
And they're manipulating and twisting

[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:12.040]
And they present all of this stuff like it makes sense

[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:16.720]
Right, and they, because you know why I figure if they don't have anything to talk about, they're out of job

[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:23.800]
But now CNN has done this all of a sudden quick right turn and they've gone from investigating the imprisoned or the impeachment or whatever they're calling it this way

[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:26.240]
Showed down with Iraq, that's the new Marquino

[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.400]
And all they're talking about is Baghdad and how Saddam is not doing this and he won't do that

[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:35.920]
And then, so now they've got the world over a barrel waiting for the impeachment things going on tomorrow and Friday

[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:40.980]
Right, I need to nail them, let's call them, you know, but I can't do it alone and I don't know

[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:43.280]
As long as we keep listening, they're going to keep going

[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:45.860]
Yeah, well, what's the alternative?

[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.760]
That's what I've been calling you for

[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.520]
I say the alternative is check out Gotting Light today at 3 o'clock

[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:51.020]
Okay

[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.120]
Any chance for the hockey tickets?

[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:54.940]
Chance of what?

[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:58.180]
Are you giving away the hockey tickets for tonight?

[01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.380]
When did I say that?

[01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:02.020]
I thought you said, you have hockey tickets for tonight

[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:03.220]
I do, two of them mine

[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:05.360]
Okay, we have an open line in Brown

[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:08.100]
I never made any mention of hockey tickets

[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:08.920]
Did I say anything?

[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:11.640]
I said the penguins in the panthers tonight, I'll be there

[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:11.880]
No

[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.220]
Did I say that?

[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:13.500]
No

[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:16.260]
Yes I did, did I say anything about giving away hockey tickets?

[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:17.540]
No, you want some?

[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:22.980]
You know, here we are, here we are on the verge of the president being impeached

[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:28.540]
I got a woman that calls me to show you about freeloading bitches we have in this town

[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:33.760]
And why I have like, you know, we got all the men listening to this show where I'll set with men, so to speak

[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:36.800]
But women, we can't buy them for lover money

[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:40.520]
And this woman calls under the pretext of being concerned about the media

[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.580]
What are we going to do?

[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:43.700]
What if, and then, oh, could I have the hockey tickets?

[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.140]
It's like, Stan, midnight tonight there's going to be nuclear war

[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:51.380]
We're all going to be dead by 12.30 in the morning

[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:55.400]
And somebody calls in and says, well, long game will be over by 10.30

[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:56.280]
Can I have the tickets?

[01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:59.740]
Might as well go out with it, you know, have some excitement there

[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:03.720]
Was that incredible?

[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:06.840]
Even George just sunk into his chair with a look on his push

[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:09.040]
I couldn't even begin to describe

[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.360]
It was creepy

[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.560]
It was almost as creepy as

[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.700]
It was the large and in the basket

[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:15.380]
But not quite

[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:18.680]
How we doing over there at the pizza lot plasered by the way

[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.900]
With Chris and whoever he's got with him today

[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:25.060]
207 bucks at last count, pretty slow over there

[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:28.060]
And that's because I had told you we had 97,000 and 621

[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.720]
We're getting real close to the 100 grand psychologically

[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.000]
I should never have told you that

[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:34.860]
I should have lied and strung you along

[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:36.780]
And then come up with the real big number on Friday

[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.860]
Which by the way, don't forget Saturday

[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:41.840]
Noon to two will be at the borders out there in the plantation acres

[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.640]
Whatever that is

[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:45.400]
I'm going to write this right next to Amaco right next to Best Buy

[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.440]
The borders books

[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:49.460]
Noon to two this Saturday with all our best of stuff

[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:50.840]
We have an open line at date

[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:54.420]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:56.140]
Here's coconut creak hello

[01:25:57.380 --> 01:25:58.120]
Hello Nail

[01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:58.580]
Yes sir

[01:25:58.580 --> 01:25:59.600]
Hey this is Brian

[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:00.360]
How you doing Brian

[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.660]
I haven't talked to you in a couple years

[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:02.440]
Well here I am

[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:05.160]
I just want to let you know I stopped over there yesterday at Coral Spring

[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.440]
Then picked up the two CDs

[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.140]
Thank you

[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:08.480]
They are the best ever

[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.200]
Yes they are

[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:10.560]
I'll say anybody out there

[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:14.160]
Anybody out there is a Neil Fan that has not purchased these new CDs

[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.240]
You've got to get out there

[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:16.360]
They'll be peeing in their pants

[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:17.040]
That's right

[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.580]
By the way I've got a song here you requested

[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:20.840]
I think you might enjoy this

[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:21.120]
Okay

[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:25.020]
Before I play it I want to say hello real quick to Andy Berry at Aqualuck's Paint

[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:27.420]
And that other famous painter Steve McDonald

[01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:28.320]
Okay

[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:29.480]
Okay here we go

[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.180]
Don't forget to hitler too he was a famous painter

[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:33.940]
We get it on here

[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:34.380]
Uh huh

[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:36.400]
Oh we don't tell you what we don't want

[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.960]
This feature he's very good by the way

[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.480]
Perfect for the Atkins too by the way

[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:42.440]
Go ahead Brian

[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:45.040]
Ah!

[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:46.660]
Mixed rider!

[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:47.120]
Live!

[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:47.700]
Oh!

[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:58.180]
It's comprised of devil with a blue dress on, huh?

[01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:00.660]
What a top up you don't have to get to hear about that music

[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:03.040]
I still talk about the amp thing out there

[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:06.200]
You know what they said about Mitch Rider by the way

[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:07.120]
Thanks a lot Brian

[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:09.000]
I wouldn't be surprised if I had that back there

[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000]
I'm gonna look for it during the break

[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:14.760]
We're gonna play that non-stop all week long devil with a blue dress on

[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.340]
It was the stain on the blue dress

[01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:17.600]
That was the problem

[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:21.160]
Wouldn't it be something if the American government comes tumbling down

[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:24.900]
Because of a semen stain on a blue dress from some Jap

[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:26.320]
Wouldn't that be something, huh?

[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:26.660]
Uh huh

[01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:28.460]
Yeah you can say that again say it again

[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:29.480]
Uh huh

[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.600]
One more time

[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:31.000]
No

[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:33.340]
Oh my god

[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:34.480]
The stain on the dress

[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.480]
If we wouldn't have had that they would have had no evidence

[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.400]
It would have been he said she said it went

[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.640]
And we could have gone all over the life like we should have gone on

[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.820]
But we had that Nazi Kenneth star

[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.680]
That no good miserable right wing son of a bitch

[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:50.420]
With that sanctimonious look on his face

[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:55.280]
Who is enjoying who is relishing who is getting sexual excitement from every moment of it

[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:58.120]
Even you notice during the when he was testifying there

[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.460]
For the house judiciary committee his hands were on the table

[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:01.680]
He was squeezing himself

[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:03.460]
Every word that he said he was squeezing it

[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.540]
That's what excitement he was getting

[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:06.720]
He was relishing it

[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:08.820]
He was that's right even put relish on it

[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.180]
Misurable piece of turd

[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:15.920]
Putting on an act

[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.880]
An act that will net in in the history of Hollywood

[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.680]
There's never been an acting job like the one that he did

[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:26.600]
And then of course Sam dash walks away from this

[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:28.380]
A man that's got some respect around Washington

[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:30.620]
Because he said it was totally unethical what he did

[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:31.820]
Going there is an advocate

[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:33.280]
Not just presenting the report

[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:34.220]
Here's what I discovered

[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:35.620]
Here you do whatever you want with it

[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:36.880]
Like stick it in your recto

[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:37.600]
Whatever you want to do

[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:40.720]
Now he goes there selling the impeachment business

[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.200]
Because that's what he was put up to in the first place

[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.480]
That's what this has all been out of all about from the beginning

[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:48.940]
Couldn't get him on file gate

[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:49.780]
No travel gate

[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:50.620]
No white water

[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:50.840]
No

[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.540]
Any other gate

[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:53.660]
Monica gate there you go that's what we got

[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:54.500]
Monica gate

[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.980]
And Linda trip who just happened to tape those conversations

[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:01.160]
With the help of her good friend Lucy and Goldberg

[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:01.780]
That bitch

[01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:04.100]
That big fat cow up there in New York

[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:06.680]
Who was running around Jason George McGovern with tape recorders

[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:08.160]
About 20 some years ago

[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:12.200]
Eva Brown Jr

[01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:16.200]
That's when you know the sad part of this loose in Goldberg

[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.160]
Are we embarrassed?

[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:18.300]
The Jews apologize

[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:21.560]
Monica, thank God Linda trip ain't Jewish anyway

[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:22.480]
We got one going there

[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:23.380]
Thank God for that

[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:26.840]
Four minutes till noon at 5.50 WQM

[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:29.340]
And all the stress that's going on right now we need a break

[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:31.180]
Where's my Stogie? That's right

[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:33.600]
Put a big round one in your purse and just relax

[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.660]
Be criminalized pot in Florida

[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.100]
I've prosecuted for the fright

[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:47.940]
You're like a Nazi from the Overt's right

[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:51.740]
A prisoner's anus to find anything

[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:55.460]
Like women who I can in between

[01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:59.100]
What's your problem Kenny Stubbs?

[01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:02.400]
Don't you think you got too far?

[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:08.360]
Everybody thinks you are like Joseph McCarthy

[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:14.860]
If you know that Joseph McCarthy was gay

[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:18.900]
The kind of life he can't accept he never bays

[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:22.500]
He kept right close most by his side

[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:26.440]
Until he got fired with broken sides

[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:30.000]
What's your problem Kenny Stubbs?

[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.100]
It's been that and we're heroes gone

[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:39.060]
We would want to take you us like Joseph McCarthy

[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:42.580]
We preach, we preach, we preach

[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:44.640]
Orchid

[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:45.980]
We preach, we preach

[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:51.960]
We say 287 is that we've said dead or an adorned author

[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:54.300]
The pizza law flies on University Drive in Davy

[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:56.240]
Of course that was a location those guys picked

[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.480]
I picked Coral Springs yesterday

[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:01.100]
We raised over 2100 bucks there in Coral Springs

[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:01.680]
Nice going

[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.680]
I mean haven't we already pretty much exhausted the pizza law

[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.820]
Back when we did our first thing back in October

[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.800]
The very first couple of days didn't we already do that?

[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:12.780]
Not that I'm not saying we won't do okay

[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:16.960]
But I don't think we will 287 bucks in the crisis sitting out there real lonely

[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:19.040]
He's right there in the air with the QA in Van

[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.300]
You can't miss it between nations back in Pierreland imports

[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:23.600]
Right there on University Drive for Christ's Sakes

[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.620]
In addition to which now that I think of it

[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:30.380]
How far is that from University and Broward Boulevard where we just were a few days ago?

[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:31.220]
George

[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.360]
You could roll a goddamn stone

[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:39.720]
From where they are right now maybe maybe just you know Chris wants a free meal with pizza law

[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.960]
And then maybe tomorrow we'll go somewhere that might be some people

[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:45.100]
We just got finished draining that area a couple of days ago

[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:47.620]
We just sucked a blood out of that particular territory

[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:49.140]
No wonder it's slower in molasses

[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:52.120]
University and Broward Boulevard it's right about a goddamn corner

[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.120]
You dodo bird

[01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:00.660]
I say Weston I say tomorrow Weston okay how far is it from Weston that they can't go out there to Weston

[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:04.860]
I'm sure there's somebody that will feed him for free out there in Weston or whatever the hell

[01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:06.380]
Get him out there in Weston and Bob

[01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:09.260]
The Ben and Bob's will probably stick it to give him some food

[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:11.500]
Here's Miami hello

[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:13.000]
Hello

[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:13.580]
Yes sir

[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:14.340]
Hi Neil

[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:16.780]
21 years since I've spoken to you

[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:17.180]
Really?

[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:22.100]
Yes

[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:24.680]
I'm happy to see we've got some place after all this time

[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:29.000]
That's just the one item to thank you for your continued support

[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000]
The second item is regarding the presidency and this activity

[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:33.620]
Yes sir

[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:38.720]
The fellow that called in saying Bob Graham's group is divorced from reality

[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.180]
He has certainly a good point

[01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:43.240]
I send a correspondence to him

[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:49.060]
Asking him to act in behalf of the presidency and keeping Clinton there

[01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:52.200]
He has done a good job on his official capacities

[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.560]
And I got the most negative

[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:58.460]
I sounded like I was getting a Republican response

[01:32:58.460 --> 01:32:58.780]
Really

[01:32:58.780 --> 01:33:01.840]
But I guess when you get to a certain financial level

[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:04.100]
You do become Republican and you're thinking

[01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:07.620]
Yeah well Bob Graham has always been a real cast per milk toast

[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:08.820]
You know writing the middle of the fence

[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:13.280]
And on this thing he always has to make sure he tells us how repulsive his behavior was

[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:16.740]
And how unacceptable it was and all of the sudden but he never saw a freight train

[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:21.140]
Well it also comes around what goes around comes around

[01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:26.640]
Well I send a contribution to the president for his legal defense fund

[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:31.220]
And in the future if in fact this impeachment does come down

[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:31.440]
Yeah

[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:35.340]
I intend to support any Democrat

[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:37.740]
I don't care if they have a 10th grade education

[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:39.740]
And they can't do it

[01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:43.740]
Well I mean really just if they want to go that route

[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:45.880]
We can jeopardize the country this way

[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:50.120]
I voted for Republican presidents in the past, Bush and Reagan

[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:54.660]
And well everyone has to get the best efforts

[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:59.720]
But nonetheless I can turn around and just be as much of a surfeit the other way

[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:08.140]
So I'm in certainly an agreement with you and trying to separate the difference between sexuality

[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:12.620]
By the way when we elect the president we give them a home and an office in their home

[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:14.320]
And that's a private quarter

[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:16.960]
And what's the oral office anyway what's wrong with that guy?

[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:17.600]
Well

[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:18.600]
And have a great day

[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:19.500]
Yeah well

[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.780]
And happy holidays and we'll talk to you in another 21 years

[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:22.240]
Thank you

[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:25.480]
Okay we have an open line today 5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:27.180]
Palm 5 60 on the mobile one line

[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:30.560]
I'm not going to repeat what you told me before the by the way about that national public radio thing

[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:31.580]
Or should I repeat that?

[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.240]
I mean they're going to put these calls on here?

[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:34.580]
Huh?

[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:39.340]
They should put me on here not the goddamn calls they should put me on here

[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:44.380]
Telling it exactly the way it is I should they said it is goddamn not the Frank says no I'm seeing it right now

[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:51.180]
This sanctum only is goody too. She was hypocrite who probably don't even have a penis instead of him sitting there with his BDI looking

[01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:55.800]
Those goofy glasses that he's got on I got glasses that look better than that mister and evil in my goddamn

[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:59.400]
Pippa over by a four head here. I still could tell it a lot better than he is

[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:04.580]
To the American public listening to this spoon fed bull crap coming from the media

[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:07.280]
Which is all that it is

[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:12.600]
24 hours a day now we have non stop that's right because they got a lot of time to kill

[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:16.900]
Here's North Miami hello

[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:18.880]
Hello yes sir

[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:26.140]
Nail yes it's worth about this whole thing I don't know why the American public can't see it this crap went on the White House

[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:31.380]
It's a cool to talk yeah, that's what it is I mean I said that's what I said first thing this morning to bloodless school

[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:36.080]
Yeah, but bunch of cool stuff. Oh, no both. He was gonna do this is a bunch of crap

[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:43.860]
Yeah, thank you much. Okay. Thank you. The guy said it's a bunch of her so what's wrong with that he hit her right on the head

[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:52.260]
They'd lines all open by the way 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 animal mobile one line leave it to our audience. Okay, leave me in the lurch here now

[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:55.180]
They don't care. They got nothing to say about this

[01:35:55.860 --> 01:36:00.520]
They think I'm more important fish to fry. They got to worry about that Denver and Miami game Monday night

[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:04.460]
They got to worry about the points bread on the the Batavia Lee War game tonight

[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.140]
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello

[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:11.580]
Port Lauderdale Mr. Rogers. Yes sir. Hey, I

[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:12.980]
Can I get off the

[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:18.140]
There you can say whatever you like it's your moment in the sunshine. All right good

[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:18.820]
I

[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:22.360]
I thought that they had done away with these like in the 60s and 70s

[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:26.900]
I just had the Avon lady over here. Have you seen the Avon lady in the last 20 years?

[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:31.640]
I got news for when the Avon lady comes to my door. You won't see her no more. Hey, well take this down

[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:38.340]
It'd be an easy way to go ahead you take care of the wife you buy the the basket and everything it come right here

[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:41.060]
How should buy it up and it's done?

[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:44.680]
So I'm looking through there. You know kind of nail polish and perfume

[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:51.580]
What kind of stuff like that? But $89 worth of Avon. Yeah, so she's walking across the street

[01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:54.480]
I'm going through the basket and unbelievable but

[01:36:54.480 --> 01:37:01.460]
Stupid bitch. She forgot to put the lotion in the best. It puts the lotion in the basket

[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:09.740]
We have an open-line in brow. How did I know five six seven oh five 60 and pound five 60 on the mobile one line one more time?

[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:11.720]
It puts the lotion in the basket

[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:17.460]
All overcome people are asking one question. It's not about impeachment

[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:22.880]
They have one question that they want to know right now. What is a buffalo bill nine minutes after noon at five

[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:26.320]
60 WQ and the boaster for Hank they want to put another fat guy next year today

[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:30.980]
So he'll be over there at you will stay two at two o'clock and at six o'clock Kimba bo camp or briefly before

[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:37.240]
Panthers hockey man you can smell it in the air can't you that enthusiasm about the penguins bathers game seven thirty-night? No

[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:39.120]
My

[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:46.040]
Sports work

[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:11.520]
You're not a pick

[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:11.660]
Back

[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:16.340]
Now, and in charge, just with your demons.

[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.340]
Before we use our ass, pick a can of bells.

[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:22.480]
Oh, like that, that's right.

[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:24.980]
That's right, that's right, that's right.

[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:26.360]
You're waiting for me.

[01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:28.200]
That's right, that's right.

[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:29.560]
Yeah.

[01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:33.980]
You're waiting for me.

[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:35.720]
That's right, that's right.

[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:36.240]
Yeah.

[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:45.840]
I'm going to get a minute.

[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:47.020]
We'll finish right away.

[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:47.680]
There's a break.

[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:50.560]
I'll see if it can be.

[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:51.580]
I can be all the time.

[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:54.480]
I'll look for that thing.

[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:55.500]
Devil in the blue dress on.

[01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:56.060]
I guarantee you.

[01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:57.880]
If I don't find it there today, I'll be playing that tomorrow.

[01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:00.960]
And all during these speechment hearings, it's the God damn devil.

[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.100]
But the blue dress on her name was Monica.

[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:05.960]
She couldn't get picked up on Santa Monica Boulevard in LA.

[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:07.260]
I'll guarantee you that right now.

[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.400]
Here's the lady, especially the way she looks these days.

[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.500]
Here's the lady in four-letter day.

[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:12.680]
Hello.

[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:15.880]
Lady in four-letter day.

[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:18.080]
Which I heard the radio in the back blur in a way.

[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:18.980]
And I'm going, bop, bop, bop.

[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:20.380]
Are you there? Do you be there?

[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:22.760]
Now, she's just sitting there with a phone in her...

[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:23.120]
Brackdom.

[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:24.220]
Open line in Broward.

[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:27.400]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pawn 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:29.020]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:30.240]
Hello, now.

[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:30.900]
Yes, sir.

[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:32.020]
Hold on. Let me turn on the radio.

[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:33.680]
Turn on the radio.

[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:34.640]
The shower here.

[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.800]
I do have a life, and I hold on, you know, during the commercial and all that.

[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:40.360]
I sounded like you were holding on to it.

[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:41.860]
It's not too tight, though.

[01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:43.700]
Hey, let me ask you a question.

[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:46.100]
Who does the, uh-huh, and the nose?

[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:47.180]
Uh-huh.

[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:47.660]
No.

[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:48.280]
Larry King.

[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:49.100]
Both of them?

[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:49.500]
Right.

[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:51.700]
You couldn't even...

[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:52.940]
You can't tell that voice.

[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:53.700]
What the?

[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.080]
You can't tell that voice.

[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:56.740]
And then we'll do it that.

[01:39:57.260 --> 01:39:57.380]
Yeah.

[01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:58.940]
That I could tell, but the...

[01:39:58.940 --> 01:39:59.180]
No.

[01:39:59.180 --> 01:39:59.240]
No.

[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:00.280]
It was...

[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:01.980]
That's hilarious.

[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:03.940]
Um...

[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:04.840]
Phil Henry this morning.

[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:06.400]
That's a great radio.

[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:07.080]
Yeah.

[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.780]
With, uh, Brad the Booger, come on.

[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:09.880]
Where I wasn't at the best.

[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:10.380]
I forgot.

[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:11.560]
I forgot we had that in there.

[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:12.740]
Brad the Booger.

[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:14.360]
I was reaching to my nose while I was listening.

[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.140]
I didn't even know why.

[01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:19.120]
Let me tell you, now, it brings back so many good memories.

[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:19.500]
Yeah.

[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.080]
To Phil Henry and now...

[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:21.940]
Those were the age boy.

[01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:23.260]
They had a great thing over there.

[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:24.600]
They didn't know what they had in their hand.

[01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:26.440]
You guys would be dominant right now.

[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:26.780]
Yeah.

[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:29.780]
And any market, if you guys were, you know, the way you had it,

[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:30.920]
you guys were the best.

[01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:31.700]
Yeah, you're right.

[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:32.600]
It couldn't get any better.

[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:34.080]
Are you sure?

[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:34.720]
Positive.

[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:38.740]
And one thing, just calling to say happy holidays and all that good stuff to everybody.

[01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:41.080]
And also, if you could do, I mean, one...

[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:43.000]
Sure, it's all request week, man. It's the holidays.

[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:43.660]
What that?

[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:45.060]
I said it's all request week.

[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:45.740]
It's the holidays.

[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:47.480]
Um, Neil wakes me up in the morning.

[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:47.940]
Okay.

[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:48.380]

[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:48.920]
Okay, pal.

[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:49.600]
No, see the greatest.

[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:50.520]
Go wipe it off.

[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:50.880]
See it.

[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:51.340]
Okay.

[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:54.880]
Ah, Neil wakes me back to those day today.

[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:55.700]
That's what we need.

[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.800]
We need to bring in the bird for the impeachment hearings.

[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.340]
Neil wakes me up in the morning.

[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:01.080]
All right.

[01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:03.620]
Neil wakes me up with a smile

[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:04.920]
with a smile on it.

[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:06.440]
brings me my coffee

[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:08.000]
and lunch and I'm with you.

[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:10.460]
with Santa Barbara star.

[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:15.380]
Santa Barbara star, with Santa Barbara star.

[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:17.360]
with Santa Barbara star.

[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:21.980]
Why did you work in my room with a dolly male?

[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:22.100]
I started a guitar play a little when I killed.

[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:25.680]
With a pair of 4 on my dodge I'll hit with a pen.

[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.680]
David Opel is Motion.

[01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:58.320]
That's only one reason that George don't like here in the board on here.

[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.480]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:05.440]
Here's a lady mobile in Pemberpine.

[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:05.840]
Hello.

[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:06.860]
Hi, Neil.

[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:07.620]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:08.240]
How are you?

[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:08.680]
Great.

[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.880]
You never called the boxer before in my whole life.

[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:11.420]
OK.

[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:12.580]
Always the first time.

[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:13.820]
Always the first time.

[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:14.660]
And it could be the last time.

[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:15.000]
I never know.

[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:16.580]
You're going to think I'm an idiot.

[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.540]
But what does it mean when he says it

[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:19.820]
puts the lotion in the basket?

[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:21.920]
Oh, well, I'll have to play that whole bit for it.

[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:22.640]
From did you see style?

[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:23.920]
No, I mean, I've heard it.

[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:24.960]
And I pee in my pants.

[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:25.460]
I just fall.

[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:26.020]
I just fall.

[01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:27.880]
But you didn't have to do the styling to the lens?

[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:28.580]
Right.

[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:30.240]
Well, I never really saw that movie, though.

[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:31.840]
Now you've got to go out and read it.

[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:32.480]
And then you'll understand.

[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:33.440]
I can't, you have to get it.

[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:34.800]
I can't, I don't want to spoil it.

[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:36.740]
That'll make sense when I see the movie.

[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:37.300]
Absolutely.

[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:37.840]
OK.

[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.420]
That thing is just the funniest thing ever.

[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:41.520]
If you pee in your pants now hearing it,

[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:43.220]
without even seeing it, then it's great.

[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.160]
Go out and get it.

[01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:47.560]
It is just the funniest thing.

[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:48.480]
And I think you are great.

[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:50.120]
You just never run out of stuff to say.

[01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:50.660]
It's amazing.

[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:51.120]
Exactly.

[01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:52.640]
By the way, when you're full of it,

[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:54.700]
it flows out easily like a broken toilet.

[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:55.480]
It's just nonstop.

[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:56.400]
Now, it's your wonderful.

[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:57.260]
Have a great holiday, sweetheart.

[01:42:57.260 --> 01:42:58.660]
You're too near luck to your life.

[01:42:58.920 --> 01:42:59.020]
Bye.

[01:42:59.520 --> 01:42:59.720]
Bye.

[01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:00.820]
This is Debbie.

[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:01.700]
Hello, Debbie.

[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:04.400]
I'm interested in getting some operations done.

[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:05.200]
OK.

[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:07.520]
And some body contouring and some liposuction.

[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:10.300]
And I was wondering if it's from Tummy Talk.

[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:13.260]
And lip augmentation, cosmetic compresses,

[01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:15.300]
surgery, face mist for all of these things.

[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:15.940]
Uh-huh.

[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:17.140]
And you're just wondering.

[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:18.320]
What would you like to start with?

[01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:20.820]
Well, I need to get everything done.

[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:22.920]
Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed

[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:25.240]
is my thing.

[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:26.800]
OK, we don't do that.

[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.280]
No.

[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:29.180]
Could you do blasting plants, though?

[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:32.840]
It can be done, depending on how they would do right away.

[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:34.740]
The lotion in the basket.

[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:36.800]
How much?

[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:38.420]
5,000.

[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:39.140]
Excellent.

[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:41.520]
I'd like to have my skin resurface too.

[01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:43.360]
Laser surgery.

[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:47.300]
Have the lambs stop crying yet, mommy?

[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:48.580]
Excuse me.

[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.500]
Don't hurt mommy's little baby.

[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.020]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:56.760]
I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV.

[01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:57.660]
OK.

[01:43:58.060 --> 01:43:59.940]
Can you make me look more like a woman?

[01:44:00.340 --> 01:44:01.460]
Well, we'll have to see you first.

[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:03.880]
And then upon looking at you, we can tell you that when we see you.

[01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:07.920]
Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts, mommy?

[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:09.720]
If you'd like to.

[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:11.980]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:13.380]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:14.480]
Yes.

[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:15.320]
OK.

[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.120]
There is a $100 consultation fee.

[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:18.980]
That's fine.

[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:21.220]
OK.

[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:26.040]
My name is Buffalo Bill.

[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:26.540]
OK.

[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:27.880]
Let me get a little information from you.

[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:28.160]
OK.

[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:31.340]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:32.360]
I understand.

[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:34.880]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:37.220]
Do you want to come in for a consultation?

[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:41.080]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:42.100]
OK.

[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:44.300]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:45.260]
Or do you want to call me back?

[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:47.340]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:47.960]
I understand.

[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:49.720]
I got my skin suit and liposuction.

[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:54.800]
Like, you know, Bill, it puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.120]
I understand that.

[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:58.660]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.320]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:02.340]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:03.160]
OK.

[01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:04.100]
I will talk to you in the train.

[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:04.420]
OK.

[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:06.380]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:07.160]
Hello.

[01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:09.440]
OK.

[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:12.020]
21 pass known at 560 WQM.

[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:13.900]
We have an open line in day one in Broward.

[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.040]
560 705 60 55 60.

[01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:16.740]
OK.

[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:17.480]
Whatever he said.

[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:18.160]
What did he say to you?

[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:19.100]
FID doing FI.

[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:20.080]
I couldn't hear it.

[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:20.860]
Thank God.

[01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:22.420]
Open line in Broward to end date.

[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:23.780]
560 705 60.

[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:26.000]
I think it was Woody with a sock over it.

[01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:27.980]
Here's the mobile in Miami.

[01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:28.340]
Hello.

[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:29.940]
Hello, Neil.

[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:30.480]
Yes, sir.

[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:34.460]
Neil, you know, I'm a Republican.

[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:35.080]
Yeah.

[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:37.780]
I came here in the 1960s.

[01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:40.200]
And I followed the communist, the communist,

[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:41.660]
so I became a Republican.

[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:42.020]
Right.

[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:44.580]
But I'm jumping shit and I'm burning

[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:47.300]
by a border registration car

[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:48.460]
based on what I've been seeing.

[01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:48.980]
Good.

[01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:51.020]
So I'm jumping shit.

[01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:54.260]
This is disgusting what these Republicans are doing

[01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:54.860]
to the present.

[01:45:55.140 --> 01:45:56.900]
Yeah, we've lost the two party system.

[01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:58.700]
We now have the Democratic party, which is pretty

[01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:00.180]
on much on the weak side, but nevertheless.

[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:01.880]
And we got to be Republicans, which

[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:03.700]
have been taken over by the right wing element,

[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:04.840]
by the fascist.

[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.400]
And there's nothing else left there.

[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:07.700]
It's that they've disappeared.

[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:08.900]
Right.

[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:11.740]
The term the Ottoman Republicans become overnight

[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:13.660]
and oxymoron, and they don't exist anymore.

[01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:15.080]
You got that right.

[01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:16.440]
Neil, happy holidays.

[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:17.880]
And thank you for taking my call.

[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:18.600]
And back to you.

[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:20.100]
And thank you for making your call.

[01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:22.740]
We have an open line in Broward, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5,

[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:25.500]
60, 0.5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:28.460]
One thing I'll tell you, it feels a lot better

[01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:30.000]
when you tear up that Republican thing.

[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:30.900]
I don't know, because they never

[01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:32.580]
wasn't Republican and thank God for that.

[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:35.020]
But when you've made all of a sudden become a Democrat,

[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:37.220]
it puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:37.740]
You'll see.

[01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:38.240]
Believe me.

[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:40.980]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:41.340]
Hello.

[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:42.340]
Hello, Neil.

[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:42.940]
Yes, sir.

[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:44.940]
Happy holidays.

[01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:46.320]
Happy holidays.

[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:47.380]
Happy holidays.

[01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:49.300]
And all of the, if they go through

[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:51.600]
with this impeachment garbage.

[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:52.060]
Yes.

[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:57.720]
I would like to see the government facilities.

[01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:00.580]
Every bastard who speeds gets

[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:02.920]
court drunk driving, all these congressmen

[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:04.040]
senators, everything else.

[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:04.320]
Yeah.

[01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:06.780]
Every one of them, the first time they screw up,

[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:08.880]
will be the last time they screw up.

[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.580]
And let's throw them out.

[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:13.060]
You get these guys, the North Florida,

[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:13.520]
who pair the...

[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:15.640]
That means the very bulldozer's got to stop screwing

[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:16.860]
around with all these guys now or what?

[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.520]
No, about the guy in North Florida.

[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:19.320]
He passed the law.

[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:21.880]
He was instrumental in passing law

[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.000]
about not the John Law.

[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:25.720]
He can't pick up a hooker.

[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:28.120]
And he gets caught because he doesn't have enough money for.

[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:28.560]
Yeah.

[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:29.800]
He gets let off.

[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:31.740]
I mean, this is nonsense.

[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:33.360]
Well, he wanted to get off, and I guess he did.

[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:36.820]
I mean, yesterday is a time that the best line

[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:38.460]
from Odd Book Hall.

[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:38.900]
Yeah.

[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:40.540]
It's a game.

[01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:43.200]
It's just a political game.

[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:45.080]
And people can't get over it.

[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.260]
Yeah, it's an...

[01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:47.600]
It's unbeatable.

[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:51.240]
Yeah, he said there's over 60% of the people

[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:52.600]
saying, don't do it.

[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.760]
Well, these are our representatives.

[01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:56.280]
Are they supposed to listen?

[01:47:56.660 --> 01:47:58.720]
Well, they're listening to a more important power.

[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:00.760]
Yeah, I was just a full-time president.

[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:01.880]
There's always been one president,

[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:05.560]
and since Roosevelt, who got over 60% of the vote.

[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:06.160]
Yeah.

[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:08.900]
I mean, I guess these votes, you know, even...

[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:10.520]
It's just flicking.

[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:11.960]
OK, take two and call me in the morning.

[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:12.600]
OK, come down.

[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:16.260]
OK, we have two open lines in Dave County, 56670560,

[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:18.340]
0.560 on the mobile one line.

[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:19.940]
They're pissed off and fired up, baby.

[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:21.140]
Make no mistake about that.

[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:22.240]
Aren't they?

[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:22.980]
Are they pissed off?

[01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:25.960]
Pist off gets me fired up when I hear someone say that.

[01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:26.320]
Oh!

[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:26.820]
All right.

[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:27.760]
We're happy to hear that.

[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:31.140]
I mean, you can get fired off and fired up

[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:33.320]
about something more than just a kind of a stupid ball game,

[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:33.760]
can't you?

[01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:34.080]
No.

[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:35.900]
Here's a mobile and Hollywood.

[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:36.560]

[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:38.100]
Hey, nice to meet you.

[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:38.240]
Nice to meet you, sir.

[01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:38.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:39.060]
Fine.

[01:48:39.540 --> 01:48:40.500]
That's good to hear, sir.

[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:42.000]
I want to wish you a happy holiday season.

[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:43.120]
And say good stuff.

[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:43.740]
Happy New Year.

[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:44.300]
Uh-huh.

[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:47.600]
But who did that crank call?

[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:48.280]
Who did one?

[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:49.960]
The crank call at the lotion and the bathroom.

[01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:50.820]
I have no idea.

[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:52.320]
That's from one of our comedy services.

[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:53.040]
Oh, my God.

[01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:53.920]
That's the best, man.

[01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:55.680]
Some great, demented soul that we love.

[01:48:56.620 --> 01:49:00.340]
Is that the end thing I'm going to make it up to the West Palm area, by the way, James?

[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:00.980]
Is it one?

[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.120]
Is it going to make it up to the West Palm area?

[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:05.020]
I always think we go to Boka.

[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:08.120]
We're not going to make it all the way to West Palm, but I don't think we got any gifts for that.

[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:09.480]
You got a lot of listeners of that.

[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:11.500]
I always think in one day next week Boka would be good.

[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:12.220]
OK.

[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:14.280]
Uh-huh.

[01:49:14.380 --> 01:49:18.360]
Like I said, maybe point and beach, how's that?

[01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:19.060]
Uh-huh.

[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:21.380]
How about Lake Worth?

[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:25.120]
How about, uh, OK, Shelby Military?

[01:49:25.860 --> 01:49:26.100]
OK.

[01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:27.220]
How about having a nice holiday?

[01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:27.960]
OK, get out of here.

[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.660]
We have an open line in Broward to and date.

[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 50.

[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:32.500]
Open lines on the board.

[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:34.280]
We're not talking about ball games here today.

[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:36.660]
We're talking about the future of the goddamn human race.

[01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:39.380]
Future of the goddamn race.

[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:40.860]
I'm giving phone numbers out here today.

[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:42.600]
That's the kind of audience we got here in this town.

[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:45.240]
OK, that's the kind of people we got in this community here.

[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:47.920]
I'm giving out phone numbers.

[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:50.540]
National public radio is taping today.

[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:51.260]
How do you like that?

[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:53.300]
Which I think they must really be desperate.

[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:54.560]
OK, if they're taping these calls.

[01:49:56.620 --> 01:50:01.280]
Like I said before, they should be taping what I'm saying and putting it on there to all those pseudo-inletituals out there

[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.560]
who are listening all 20 of them.

[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:06.400]
And here from somebody that really knows which side it's buttered on.

[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:07.400]
Let me say it again.

[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:08.800]
The bottom line to all of this.

[01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:10.200]
The media are they.

[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:13.280]
These people have become the conduit for a bunch of right-wing lunatics

[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:15.960]
and they're giving them their legitimizing them.

[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:18.220]
Because this is what they've been hoping for all along.

[01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:21.580]
That's right.

[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:24.000]
If we can't do it one way, we'll package it another way.

[01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:25.780]
We don't care what we have to do.

[01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:26.960]
How are we going to do it?

[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:29.860]
We're going to get his ass out of there for every reason it might be.

[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:32.920]
Just because we hate him like poison or whatever the reason it might be.

[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:34.500]
We're going to get his ass out.

[01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:36.620]
We're going to show him a thing or two or three.

[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:41.400]
And the media are saying, OK, sure, whatever you say.

[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:42.560]
We believe you.

[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:47.480]
We believe all you grave robbers that you're really gnashing your teeth over this.

[01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:51.160]
That's why when 70 or 80% of your constituents call in and say no to impeachment.

[01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:53.260]
And just do a censure thing and get this over with.

[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:55.620]
That's why you say, well, I'm going to vote yes for impeachment.

[01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:58.000]
Does it make any sense?

[01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:58.440]
No.

[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.340]
1226 and 560 WQM.

[01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:07.920]
The Panthers and Pingwings pangleth, an actual car rental center tonight.

[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:11.660]
Join Chris Moore, Randy Muller and Steve Goldstein for the action.

[01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:14.800]
Panthers preview starts at seven on sports radio.

[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:16.380]
I got something to catch you better.

[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:17.920]
You better start for you after this bit.

[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:20.400]
You're not going to know where the screen will read your banana.

[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:21.160]
Deal Rodgers.

[01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:21.380]

[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:25.480]
Joel, are you really that stupid Joel?

[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:27.840]
Frank Einstein, are you really?

[01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:29.080]
That's it.

[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:29.840]
Goodbye.

[01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:31.380]
A young man.

[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:32.420]
Please see you.

[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:37.240]
Turn 28 is scored the sweetest bag.

[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:39.880]
I'll be on the next day.

[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:41.080]
All right.

[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:45.360]
Too many seeds in your dime bag.

[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:46.300]
Are you sure?

[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:48.600]
Getting to the party.

[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:50.760]
Two minutes to late.

[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:52.920]
Isn't it the chronic?

[01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:55.680]
Don't you think?

[01:51:56.900 --> 01:51:58.040]
It's not great.

[01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:04.360]
When you left on break, the free bath.

[01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:10.320]
When you're already baked, do it with me.

[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:14.140]
As you just did, it's a day.

[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.300]
Who would've thought you'd get it?

[01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:22.300]
Hard, brownie.

[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:24.680]
That you already ate.

[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:28.280]
A new, donut-dine.

[01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:30.840]
A lot that you've raised.

[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:36.600]
It's like 10,000 joints when all you need is a light.

[01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:39.520]
It's like having the feel of your dreams.

[01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:42.240]
And then finding out you saw 10 delight.

[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:45.080]
And here's a new surprise.

[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:45.460]
The chronic.

[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:48.200]
Don't you think?

[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:51.780]
A little too much chronic.

[01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:54.740]
Yeah, I really do think.

[01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:56.100]
It's not great.

[01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:02.580]
When you left on break, the free bath.

[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:08.420]
When you're already baked, do it with me.

[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:12.200]
As you just did, it's a day.

[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:16.880]
Who would've thought you'd get it?

[01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:19.100]
23 of 560.

[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:19.840]
WQM.

[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.200]
You're in a lot of station for the 90s.

[01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:23.200]
We fit in like a rubber glove right inside your...

[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:27.040]
So anyway, well, we got 293 bucks over there at the Apeatsiloft class.

[01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:27.620]
It's a very weak.

[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:29.180]
So Chris is thinking of moving the Q&A.

[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:30.880]
Did he move or is he thinking of moving?

[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:31.740]
Is he doing it or is he?

[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:33.800]
Oh, he's done route now.

[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:34.460]
He ought to be there.

[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:35.080]
He's done route.

[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:36.460]
He's gone back to that shell station.

[01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:47.940]
We got $1,200.

[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:48.000]

[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:48.000]

[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:48.000]

[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:48.000]

[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:48.580]
He's going back to the corner of the city.

[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:51.380]
He's going back to the corner of the city.

[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:53.760]
He'll be there momentarily at the shell station there.

[01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:56.400]
We got $1,200.

[01:53:56.860 --> 01:53:58.360]
So maybe there's a few bucks left in that neighborhood.

[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:01.240]
In fact, if you're coming out of that veterinarian next door,

[01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:03.680]
if they left any money in your pocket, give it to Chris.

[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:07.220]
No, my old veterinarian has read the plantation animal hospital

[01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:08.400]
is right next to that shell station.

[01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:10.700]
I used to go there, but...

[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:11.500]
Okay, we have two...

[01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:13.120]
So anyway, here's the story.

[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:15.840]
You better strap yourselves in if you're driving,

[01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:16.960]
pull off the side of the road.

[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:21.880]
Maybe you long-time list is a recall a guy named Joel,

[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:23.940]
which I used to call him Frankenstein,

[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:27.320]
back from the old days when we were on in Tampa.

[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:29.640]
I guess it was before that, because he was over here

[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:30.840]
and then he moved over there.

[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:32.000]
Where were he is?

[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:34.780]
He's an asshole.

[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:37.020]
Well, I mean, you know, he was a chronic.

[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:39.200]
And he was okay, I thought, in his own business.

[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:41.220]
He's a big guy with like a nut in his forehead.

[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:44.440]
He looks like one of the monsters or Frankenstein on a bad day.

[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:47.600]
So anyway, Joel calls up George about ten minutes ago.

[01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:50.220]
After I said, you know, the guy calls and asks me

[01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:52.380]
where that bit comes from, where the guy is saying...

[01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:54.340]
It works the lotion in the basket.

[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:56.040]
You know, Buffalo Bill from Silence of Lens.

[01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:57.840]
And it's a comedy bit.

[01:54:58.020 --> 01:54:59.360]
I mean, anybody would have brained you here,

[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.240]
the phony phony, and Joel says,

[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:02.700]
oh, don't you know where that guy is?

[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:03.380]
No, where that came from?

[01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:04.860]
It came from Silence of Lens.

[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:12.280]
And he was serious.

[01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:14.340]
That's the best part.

[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:16.840]
He was getting serious.

[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:18.800]
Oh.

[01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:21.080]
It works the lotion in the basket.

[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:23.300]
But anyway, hey, we have two open lines in date.

[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:26.600]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:29.940]
Joel, I was going to say you could use a lobotomy,

[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:31.100]
but it looks like it's too late.

[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:31.980]
He beat us to it.

[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:33.500]
Here's Sport Myers.

[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:33.840]
Hello.

[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:35.200]
Hello, Neil.

[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:35.660]
Yes, sir.

[01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:36.220]
Happy holiday.

[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:36.860]
Back to you.

[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:38.400]
Listen, I got your tapes.

[01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:39.220]
Yes.

[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:41.480]
Actually, I got the two tapes for a current.

[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:43.720]
I got the Neil Rogers 96.

[01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:44.260]
Great.

[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:44.840]
And the nuggets.

[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:45.440]
Uh-huh.

[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:47.560]
You know, I called Center One, and they were really nice,

[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:48.460]
because I was busy.

[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:49.180]
I didn't call back.

[01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:50.280]
They called back the next thing.

[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:50.940]
That was great.

[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:53.440]
Listen, I'm pissed off and fire it up.

[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:53.860]
Good.

[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:57.040]
This Congressman I've got over here, I called their office last week.

[01:55:57.340 --> 01:55:58.760]
I don't, you probably don't know Porter Goss.

[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:00.300]
What are you, Porter Wife?

[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:01.120]
Porter Goss.

[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:04.400]
No, he's married, I think, in the Mellon family.

[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:05.380]
That sounds familiar.

[01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:05.800]
Uh-huh.

[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:06.360]
Mellon's Kate.

[01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:07.780]
Uh-huh.

[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:08.160]
Uh-huh.

[01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:12.520]
I reminded people in his office about his behavior when he was on the ethics committee,

[01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:14.360]
when Newt Gingrich was being investigated.

[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:14.840]
Yeah.

[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:15.780]
You recall what he did?

[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:16.240]
No.

[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:20.060]
Send a letter of recommendation around to his fellow Republicans.

[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:23.180]
When they were thinking about dumping new calls to these problems,

[01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:27.020]
in the middle of the investigation before it came out that he had, you know,

[01:56:27.140 --> 01:56:30.740]
used, diverted those tax exempt funds into campaigns.

[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:31.260]
Uh-huh.

[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:33.480]
So that's the kind of guy we got over here.

[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:36.300]
That's another sanctimonious hypocrite.

[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:36.720]
Exactly.

[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:37.420]
Exactly.

[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.400]
Um, by the way, your picture was on this.

[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:42.120]
I didn't know what you looked like, but you don't look that bad.

[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:43.140]
Don't get any ideas.

[01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:43.660]
No.

[01:56:44.060 --> 01:56:44.160]
No.

[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:46.600]
What's I get that little thing moved over my eyebrow?

[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:47.440]
I'm going to be beautiful.

[01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:48.780]
Oh, I look just like Brad Pitt.

[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:52.240]
Listen, I've heard you say use a term that I use.

[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:54.040]
I've never heard anybody else use it.

[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:54.440]
Yes, sir.

[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:55.420]
Dead is a door nail.

[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:56.100]
Uh-huh.

[01:56:56.540 --> 01:57:00.040]
I think I must have got that from my father, who is from Jersey tonight.

[01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:00.920]
He's a Northern term.

[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:01.640]
I don't know.

[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:03.260]
Maybe it's a, I've heard that all my life.

[01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:04.240]
Is that something new down here?

[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:05.160]
Dead is a door nail.

[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:07.200]
And I said, oh, ancient.

[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:08.060]
I haven't heard it.

[01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:08.540]
And I'll have to go on.

[01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:09.800]
I think you can Abraham once said that.

[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:10.680]
Never ask about it.

[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:15.840]
Do you think it meant like, uh, wooden nails for the, uh, door nail?

[01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:17.920]
Okay, well listen, have a great new year and a good holiday.

[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:18.500]
Okay.

[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:19.140]
Okay, we have an open-line.

[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:23.640]
It's Broward to end day five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line.

[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:25.440]
It's from the silence of the lambs.

[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:25.920]
Don't you know?

[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:27.000]
Don't you know that?

[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:29.120]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:31.520]
Oh, Joel, Joel, poor baby.

[01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:32.240]
Poor baby.

[01:57:32.380 --> 01:57:34.080]
Spent too much time over there on a west coast.

[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:36.100]
Too much time at a tapasain pit area.

[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:37.580]
I'm telling you, man.

[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:39.260]
You could go over there and you could be a genius.

[01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:41.780]
Six months, you'll come out of there going, lim lim lim lim lim like that.

[01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:44.800]
Not that he was a genius, but the only way he's doing that.

[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:47.580]
Here's a mobile in North Miami.

[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:47.920]
Hello.

[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:50.680]
Hey, you know, I can tell you about dead as a door nail.

[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:52.280]
I'm a carpenter, but you don't want to hear that.

[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:53.420]
Let's talk about the impeachment.

[01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:54.540]
Speechment?

[01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:54.840]
Okay.

[01:57:55.640 --> 01:58:03.440]
Uh, the, uh, the whole thing here, if the Republicans are dead set on committing suicide with this thing,

[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:05.240]
why don't we let them do it?

[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:08.180]
Why don't we give them this reckless hillbilly horn dog?

[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:10.280]
Well, I'll give you an example right now.

[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:13.240]
They're still hucking away on this showdown with their racking on here right now.

[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:17.280]
And we need to address that situation and do something about it before Sunday,

[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:20.520]
because that's the beginning of that big Muslim holiday that Ramadan thing,

[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:21.680]
Ramallah Medingong.

[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:27.020]
And, uh, and you got a government with their hand side now, because no matter what this government does,

[01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:31.800]
what this president does, they're going to accuse them of trying to divert attention away from the impeachment thing.

[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.220]
And so we're like in limbo.

[01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:35.460]
They're going to have us do in the limbo rock for months now.

[01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:36.420]
Exactly.

[01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:38.800]
That's what he got himself into.

[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:40.380]
But let's give him to him.

[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:41.060]
Who needs him?

[01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:42.600]
I mean, how bad did Gordi?

[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:48.200]
So in other words, you're willing to let the right wing just topple the government.

[01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:49.100]
It doesn't bother you.

[01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:52.600]
When your enemy's destroying himself, don't stand in his way.

[01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:54.340]
Right?

[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:55.580]
Okay, have a great life.

[01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:57.200]
Okay, there you go.

[01:58:57.300 --> 01:58:59.280]
He's whistlein' along with a happy song on his push.

[01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:01.340]
We have an open line in Broward two and a half days.

[01:59:01.380 --> 01:59:02.600]
Very weak on his phone over here.

[01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:05.100]
This time, you better find a station with an audience that's got something to say.

[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:06.680]
Okay, you people in National Public Radio.

[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:09.260]
Our audience, they got nothing to say about any of this or anything else.

[01:59:11.020 --> 01:59:15.640]
560-705-60, pound 560 on a mobile one line, 21 before 1 in QAN.

[01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:17.620]
I mean, at least we take it seriously on this show.

[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:19.680]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:19.980]
You know.

[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:22.480]
Listen, I'm going to launch your show.

[01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:25.260]
Just as you'd like.

[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:28.240]
Any question?

[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:32.620]
Yeah, I knew it.

[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:34.780]
Yeah, I knew it.

[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:37.420]
Yeah, I knew it.

[01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:40.860]
Oh, there was a good man.

[01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:44.380]
Oh, there was a good man.

[01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:45.560]
That is too bad.

[01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:50.100]
There is a good man.

[01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:54.340]
There is a bad man.

[01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:56.420]
There is a good man.

[01:59:56.660 --> 02:00:00.900]
There is a good man.

[02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:05.680]
On his cash did I see.

[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:08.040]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:10.240]
Means that he won't.

[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:16.960]
But then he more helpings all this radio.

[02:00:18.900 --> 02:00:19.980]
Well, the dead.

[02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:21.980]
In Grace's life.

[02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:22.780]
What?

[02:00:24.020 --> 02:00:25.980]
There is an exit.

[02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:27.140]
There is an exit.

[02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:31.700]
There is an exit.

[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:37.860]
You weren't feeling quite right.

[02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:42.400]
Then your face turned all white.

[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:47.520]
And you turned blue.

[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:48.760]
And you turned blue.

[02:00:50.940 --> 02:00:53.980]
Good bye to you.

[02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:53.980]

[02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:58.400]
Forever.

[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:04.320]
I said you're still alive.

[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:08.080]
But in a certain evidence.

[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:14.740]
Every night I'm at home.

[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:19.180]
And I'm watching TV.

[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:23.020]
Oh, my absence.

[02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:28.360]
All this dumb movies.

[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:31.440]
And listen to them.

[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:33.640]
Well, the dead.

[02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:36.880]
Whenever they're dead.

[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:39.920]
They're hard to prove.

[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:44.560]
It's now or never.

[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.620]
But as I watch his flicks.

[02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:56.120]
And I look at all those chicks.

[02:01:56.700 --> 02:02:01.460]
I wish I knew if they knew.

[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:03.380]
Who is the little girl?

[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:07.700]
Oh, let's just little girl.

[02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:31.540]
I push you through.

[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:31.540]

[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:31.540]

[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:31.540]

[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:31.540]

[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:31.540]

[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:31.580]
I push you through.

[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:31.580]

[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:31.580]

[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:31.580]

[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:31.580]

[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:32.100]
I push you through.

[02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:32.120]
I push you through.

[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:33.760]
I push you through.

[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:34.360]
I push you through.

[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:37.680]
I push you through.

[02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:39.700]
I push you through.

[02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:39.740]
I push you through.

[02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:39.740]

[02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:39.740]

[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:41.280]
Here's Miramar.

[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:41.620]
Hello.

[02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:46.540]
I think you're taking your audience's intelligence

[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:48.640]
a little bit for granted here when you're talking about the

[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:49.080]
impeachment.

[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:50.500]
What's going on with Iraq?

[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:55.720]
You're trying to lump together.

[02:02:55.720 --> 02:02:59.820]
and say, well, if there's any kind of military involvement in Iraq, everybody's going to say

[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:01.280]
it's to take away from the impeachment.

[02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:02.280]
Of course they're going to say that.

[02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:03.360]
But that's not the case, Neil.

[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:06.900]
Of course they, when they were, when they were threatening to do it two months ago, they

[02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:10.840]
were talking about it was a diversionary tactic and the timing of it with suspect, et cetera,

[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:11.280]
and so on.

[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:14.620]
And that's certain long before there was going to be any impeachment to vote in the house.

[02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:17.000]
Yeah, but the reality of the whole thing.

[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:18.120]
What is the reality of the whole thing?

[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:21.060]
The reality of the whole thing is that something's got to be done with Iraq.

[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:24.920]
They've, they've stepped away from what the United Nations granted.

[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:28.040]
Of course something has to be done, but you know as well as either if they start bombing

[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:30.580]
them into the stone age, which I'm all in favor of and they should have done a long

[02:03:30.580 --> 02:03:33.080]
time ago and Bush should have finished him off a year ago.

[02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:33.500]

[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:36.700]
But if they start doing that tonight, you know these right wing lunatics are going to

[02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:39.060]
say, see we told you this is all being done.

[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:40.060]
He made it up.

[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:41.060]
And you know what is that?

[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:44.740]
Neil, if that's the case, those same people are going to have to get in front of their

[02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:48.120]
voters and they're going to have to next election explain why.

[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:52.640]
If this isn't the mandate of the people, you know, these people who are voting for impeachment,

[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:56.660]
which you know everybody in the media likes to say this is not what they want, this is not

[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:57.160]
what they want.

[02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:58.740]
These people, these people, these people.

[02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:01.020]
What do you mean everybody in the media likes to say that?

[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:01.700]
What does that mean?

[02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:07.240]
Well, what are, what are, are the people in the media making up the number of the calls that

[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:08.700]
are coming in and telegrams an email?

[02:04:08.780 --> 02:04:09.780]
No, absolutely not.

[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:10.560]
Absolutely not.

[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:11.640]
So what does that mean?

[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:18.040]
What that means is if, if this is not what the quote unquote people want, then these elected

[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:20.940]
officials have to confront them in front of the next election.

[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:21.200]
Right.

[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:24.340]
And that's two years away.

[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:32.260]
So what is two years in the aspect of history and whether or not that this president who

[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:36.220]
put his hand on the Bible and lied in front of the people who voted for him lied to them?

[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:36.580]
Yeah.

[02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:39.860]
He doesn't deserve any time.

[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:41.400]
I mean, if you did it, you would go to jail.

[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:42.620]
He lied to them about what?

[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:44.860]
About having an afternoon, about getting blow jobs from an intern?

[02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:47.360]
He doesn't matter if you put your hand on the Bible under.

[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:49.780]
Oh, listen, take your Bible and go sit on it.

[02:04:49.820 --> 02:04:50.060]
Okay.

[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:51.420]
He put his hand on the Bible.

[02:04:52.620 --> 02:04:55.300]
This guy and the, and where, where, where was that call?

[02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:58.940]
Was the, where was that call from hunger from outer space from your ainus from your rectum?

[02:04:59.020 --> 02:04:59.880]
Where was that call from?

[02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:01.700]
I don't mean what city.

[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:03.520]
I mean, like, but what planet was that from?

[02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:04.700]
Well, what is he smoking?

[02:05:05.860 --> 02:05:07.300]
He put his hand on the Bible.

[02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:08.800]
This guy's all over the place.

[02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:11.820]
Who, does anybody, can anybody decipher what he just said?

[02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:12.080]
No.

[02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:13.940]
No, and that's why I can't deal with one more word of it.

[02:05:13.940 --> 02:05:14.180]
Okay.

[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:18.480]
You know, I, I think I'm having a conversation.

[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:19.680]
I'm listening to what he's saying.

[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:22.860]
I think I understand that all of a sudden he's like all over the, put his hand on the Bible.

[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:24.380]
I'll put your hand in your rectum.

[02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:24.600]

[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:26.700]
And pray you don't have hemorrhoids.

[02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:28.500]
Maniac.

[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:33.500]
Sounded, sounded like a little bit to Jewish to me.

[02:05:33.580 --> 02:05:34.340]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:36.860]
Yeah, but I must have been your friend David's boyfriend.

[02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:38.420]
Your accountant.

[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:42.200]
No, you could hear him squeezing his titsus.

[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:44.660]
They're 433 over there, by the way, at the new location.

[02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:47.200]
So they're doing better over there at University and Brown?

[02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:47.600]
Yeah.

[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.400]
Well, they're afraid if they go in that pizza lot,

[02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:52.420]
plans that just going to come out and twist their arm and try to sell them some food they don't want.

[02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:54.380]
433 bucks.

[02:05:54.480 --> 02:06:00.320]
We got the QA and Pan on the Corn University and Brown again at that cell station right next to plantation animal hospital right across the street.

[02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:02.360]
I mean, that's great, but we're winding up.

[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:03.100]
That's all right.

[02:06:03.380 --> 02:06:06.800]
If we, if it was going to be really tense to get that hundred grand, which it looks like it's not,

[02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:08.120]
but it was going to be nip and tuck.

[02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:11.560]
I'd be like psychotic saying, why are you wasting another whole day in the same place?

[02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:13.620]
They must have got some good crap over there the other day.

[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:15.140]
That must be it.

[02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:19.140]
Maybe there's some good chicks that came by over there and Chris wants to revisit the scene of the Islam of crime.

[02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:22.100]
Here's a mobile in sunrise.

[02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:22.460]
Hello?

[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:23.780]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:24.260]
Yes, sir.

[02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:26.260]
What do you call an eight day blow job?

[02:06:26.620 --> 02:06:28.600]
Okay, we have an open line into a two open line.

[02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:29.020]
I know.

[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:30.200]
Okay, old line.

[02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:30.700]
Okay.

[02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:32.100]
Happy harmonica.

[02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:32.500]
Okay.

[02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:33.460]
Whatever it is.

[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:36.220]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[02:06:36.220 --> 02:06:36.560]
Hello?

[02:06:37.900 --> 02:06:38.700]
Lady in Miami.

[02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:40.160]
Okay, she's gone.

[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:40.680]
She'd be gone.

[02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:41.540]
I think I did that.

[02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:42.940]
I think I just chopped you off.

[02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:43.280]
Sweetheart.

[02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:44.600]
I put my finger in the wrong spot.

[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:45.600]
Give it another try.

[02:06:45.860 --> 02:06:47.280]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:49.220]
Palm 5 60 on a mobile one line.

[02:06:50.660 --> 02:06:51.560]
Maybe that's her again.

[02:06:51.620 --> 02:06:53.060]
W Q a M talking.

[02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:53.340]
Neil.

[02:06:53.500 --> 02:06:54.140]
Oh, it's not her.

[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:54.380]
Yes.

[02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:54.860]
Go ahead.

[02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:55.280]
Oh, Neil.

[02:06:55.740 --> 02:06:56.060]
Pick you up.

[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:56.240]
Cool.

[02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:57.440]
Because I thought it was at the 1980.

[02:06:57.680 --> 02:06:58.540]
I'm not unbelievable.

[02:06:58.780 --> 02:06:59.100]
Yeah.

[02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:01.760]
Well, I have got all these other people waiting and they're not too happy about you.

[02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:02.600]
So say something good.

[02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:03.900]
Hey, how many white girls do you know?

[02:07:03.940 --> 02:07:04.420]
Name, Clarice?

[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:04.660]
Okay.

[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:05.740]
We have an open line in day.

[02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:07.760]
5 6 7 0 5 60 in Palm 5.

[02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:09.500]
That's tomorrow we're doing the names again.

[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:09.780]
Okay.

[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:14.440]
And by the way, you know, speaking of strange names, I was watching Channel 7 briefly.

[02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:17.280]
I mean, very briefly during the Channel surfing this morning.

[02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:20.980]
What kind of a name for a newscaster person is spilkeys in the ray?

[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:21.660]
Huh?

[02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:23.640]
What kind of a name is that?

[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:26.920]
I get spilkeys just watching that thing for a few seconds.

[02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:30.900]
And I, oh, let's go to spilkeys in the ray now at the, at the hysteria center.

[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:32.960]
Okay.

[02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:34.640]
Here's North Miami.

[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:35.000]
Hello.

[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:35.640]
Hey, Neil.

[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:36.060]
What's happening?

[02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:36.720]
How you doing, sir?

[02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:37.260]
All right.

[02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:38.960]
Listen, we're just reading an article yesterday.

[02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:42.560]
And the hero, did you get to catch it where it says allow the teams and the NHL are losing

[02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:42.820]
money?

[02:07:43.140 --> 02:07:43.360]
Yes.

[02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:44.380]
I talked about it yesterday.

[02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:45.520]
I had no response, of course.

[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:47.100]
Oh, well, maybe I'm a little late.

[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:47.860]
I think they're losing money.

[02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:48.940]
They're saying that all the teams were losing money.

[02:07:49.020 --> 02:07:49.820]
It said there were a lot of them.

[02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:50.500]
They're losing money.

[02:07:50.780 --> 02:07:53.000]
Well, what do you think they're leaving going to end up in a few years?

[02:07:53.620 --> 02:07:54.160]
In the toilet.

[02:07:54.660 --> 02:07:55.340]
Oh, that's terrible.

[02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:58.860]
Listen, you just got a quick request if you can place a Dix Decks for me.

[02:07:59.220 --> 02:08:00.480]
And I'd like to call somebody a douchebag.

[02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:00.860]
Yeah.

[02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:03.740]
Mike, from the ultimate textiles, you're still a douchebag.

[02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:04.580]
Dix Decks?

[02:08:04.700 --> 02:08:05.040]
Yeah.

[02:08:05.380 --> 02:08:06.020]
Or Decks Dix?

[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:06.620]
Decks Dix.

[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:06.880]
Okay.

[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:10.080]
We have an open line of data.

[02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:11.140]
566705.

[02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:13.640]
It goes to the shore where their mind is at in Dade County, okay?

[02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:14.660]
Decks Dix.

[02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:16.160]
That's what they're thinking about in Dade County.

[02:08:17.340 --> 02:08:18.920]
Here's a mobile in the homestead.

[02:08:19.020 --> 02:08:19.160]
Hello?

[02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:20.540]
I need you.

[02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:20.980]
Yes, sir.

[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:22.100]
Happy holiday.

[02:08:22.380 --> 02:08:22.920]
And back to you.

[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:25.380]
Hey, I'm just calling to say you have a great show.

[02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:30.260]
And my wife was going to talk a little while ago, but she refused to because she's scared.

[02:08:30.380 --> 02:08:30.980]
She's right here.

[02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:32.100]
She's scared of what?

[02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:32.880]
I don't know.

[02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:33.640]
She's scared of the ones.

[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:33.940]
Get on the truck, then.

[02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:34.440]
Huh?

[02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:34.960]
Oh, yeah.

[02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:38.640]
No, she just noticed the talk she's wanting to ask you something.

[02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:39.320]
Yeah.

[02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:39.980]
I guess.

[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:41.540]
Well, put her on there.

[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:42.560]
Put her ass on there.

[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:44.640]
Okay, we've got to get this thing in the show on the road here.

[02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:45.480]
Okay, hold that.

[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:47.320]
Put her fat ass on there and let's get with it.

[02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:47.840]
Right?

[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:49.520]
I know.

[02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:50.440]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:51.000]
Hi.

[02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:51.580]
How are you?

[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:51.940]
Great.

[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:52.340]
How are you?

[02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:53.180]
Good.

[02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:54.060]
I like your show.

[02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:54.760]
It's funny.

[02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:55.800]
And see, I don't fight.

[02:08:56.800 --> 02:08:57.400]
Not yet.

[02:08:57.760 --> 02:08:59.920]
I can strip out because you make fun of a lot of people.

[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:01.640]
So I didn't want to make fun of me now.

[02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:03.140]
I wouldn't make fun of you in that accident.

[02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:04.060]
I wouldn't make fun of that.

[02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:06.920]
Well, maybe you can answer me a question that I've been on top of my husband.

[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:08.460]
I've been trying to ask him what's a Yanta?

[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:10.040]
You've been on top of your husband?

[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:12.000]
I do.

[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:14.400]
A Yanta is a woman who gets on top of her husband and goes,

[02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:15.600]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap,

[02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:15.880]
like that.

[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:17.900]
And have a great holiday so you don't get out of here.

[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:21.860]
We have an open line in the Broward and two in date, five, six, seven,

[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:23.500]
oh, five, 60, pound, five, 60.

[02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:25.220]
I get the feeling, by the way.

[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:30.780]
I could be wrong, but I get the feeling that this audience isn't taking these matters very seriously here today.

[02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:32.920]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:33.340]
You know what?

[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:36.160]
I could be wrong about that, but I get the feeling.

[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:38.280]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:42.500]
But these people just haven't discovered a magnitude of what we'd be talking about here today.

[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:42.800]
Okay?

[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:44.480]
Spilky's in the Ray Myass.

[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:49.280]
Five, six, seven, oh, five, 60, pound, five, 60 on the mobile one line.

[02:09:49.580 --> 02:09:51.520]
And that Marilyn Mitchell with the cat eyes.

[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:55.000]
And you wonder why I sit here talking about America's crazier than a bed bug?

[02:09:55.620 --> 02:09:56.660]
Turn on the newscast.

[02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:57.300]
You got some woman.

[02:09:57.440 --> 02:09:58.760]
She's got like cat eyes on her.

[02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:00.220]
And she's hot going to try to find me.

[02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:04.900]
It looks like she's got a goddamn, like Sally left the vibrator and she's got to stuck two feet up inside her.

[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:05.240]
Correct him.

[02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:06.080]
Jesus, God.

[02:10:07.940 --> 02:10:10.600]
I'm getting all wound up just thinking about that channel.

[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:12.760]
Your hysteria channel.

[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:17.180]
And CNN, a far behind boy, showdown with Iraq.

[02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:18.600]
They got this Ruben guy on here.

[02:10:19.620 --> 02:10:21.520]
He's been on here for like an hour already.

[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:23.620]
Everything that happens.

[02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:25.400]
A rainstorm and buffalo.

[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:29.740]
No matter what it is, they got a big headline on here and CNN and they're like psychotic.

[02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:33.620]
Making it into a big major blown up event.

[02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:36.220]
Like Baghdad ought to be very soon.

[02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:37.680]
A major, big blown up.

[02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:38.780]
Like that thing we were out of that.

[02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:39.740]
I got facts last week.

[02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:40.100]
Remember that?

[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:40.820]
Baghdad.

[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:41.540]
What Baghdad?

[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:42.340]
There you go.

[02:10:43.460 --> 02:10:46.340]
As they say at the Abal games, baby, it's in the Baghdad.

[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:49.700]
Here's the mobile in the adventurer.

[02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:49.980]
Hello.

[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:50.980]
How are you?

[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:51.520]
How are you doing?

[02:10:51.620 --> 02:10:51.840]
Great.

[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:53.760]
She says, great colors.

[02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:54.480]
Let me tell you that.

[02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:57.100]
Yeah, these people are going to be on national public radio.

[02:10:57.480 --> 02:10:58.200]
Oh, brother.

[02:10:58.660 --> 02:10:59.100]
Unbelievable.

[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:00.100]
Two things.

[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:02.000]
First, I'll go with a butterfly net over here.

[02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:08.260]
Are you aware of the info commercial for the Bill Clinton watch every 10 seconds?

[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:08.900]
Is news gross?

[02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:09.620]
No.

[02:11:09.860 --> 02:11:10.660]
No, I have not.

[02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:13.380]
It's hilarious, the number one.

[02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:16.440]
That is true, though, on August 17th when he came on national television.

[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:19.020]
I mentioned that the next day he was doing that Pinocchio thing.

[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:20.540]
His nose kept getting longer and longer.

[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:20.940]
That's true.

[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:22.120]
Longer and longer.

[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:22.520]

[02:11:22.700 --> 02:11:25.560]
And they still for like $29.99.

[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:26.300]
Yeah.

[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:27.580]
You know, you know what?

[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:29.100]
That's probably going to him, so.

[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:38.080]
Second thing, we're debating of making a move between plantation palms and also up at acres.

[02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:41.500]
And we were curious what your, what your, what your, what is it?

[02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:43.300]
I don't even know what plantation palms is.

[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:44.980]
I think it's off of Knob Hill Road.

[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:46.780]
It's off of Knob Hill and like, Cleary.

[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:47.680]
Knob Hill and Cleary?

[02:11:48.140 --> 02:11:48.420]
Yeah.

[02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:50.320]
But you got a big public's in a big wind dixie there.

[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:50.860]
That's something.

[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:51.760]
There's nothing else there.

[02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:52.180]
But you got that.

[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:56.340]
They have like a naker and a half of property each on, on each of the, uh,

[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:59.260]
a little bit over in acre on each of the, uh, on each of the, uh,

[02:11:59.260 --> 02:11:59.700]
on each of the lots there.

[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:02.600]
That's a good place to be because you're right close by $5.95 there.

[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:02.920]
That's good.

[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:03.800]
Right.

[02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:05.460]
You don't want to come out there too much of the acres.

[02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:06.360]
You'll be too close to me.

[02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:07.580]
Oh, really?

[02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:08.580]
Plus we got a denny's.

[02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:09.360]
You don't want to be out there.

[02:12:09.580 --> 02:12:10.180]
You're on the acres?

[02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:10.600]
Yeah.

[02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:11.880]
I'm out in the acres for a long time.

[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:12.880]
Do you like it out there?

[02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:14.080]
I love it.

[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:16.280]
So like I said, you like that other place a lot.

[02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:17.340]
There we go.

[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:17.700]
Okay.

[02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:18.400]
One more last thing.

[02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:22.640]
So what do you think about the, uh, you know, you know, how the NHL does

[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:26.000]
they're officiating with their two line crew up in the front there?

[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:26.280]

[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:27.260]
The referees.

[02:12:27.260 --> 02:12:30.400]
What do you think about the NFL doing the same thing almost and then if they have to,

[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:31.520]
they would have to go to replay.

[02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:34.180]
I think what the NFL ought to do is just eliminate the referees.

[02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:34.440]
Okay.

[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:37.460]
I thought all the officials just get them off the, seriously, because if they voted

[02:12:37.460 --> 02:12:40.740]
no for the playoffs, it goes to show you they don't take it seriously enough.

[02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:41.960]
Well, we'll wait till next year.

[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:42.740]
We'll get a straightened out.

[02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:43.400]
We don't want to do enough.

[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:43.820]
Okay.

[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:44.120]
Fine.

[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:47.020]
So what they're basically saying to you is that the playoffs is super goal.

[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:48.580]
It's not important enough to get it right.

[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:49.540]
Let's just get it over with.

[02:12:49.660 --> 02:12:50.320]
That's what they're saying.

[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:50.760]
Okay.

[02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:52.740]
So they're saying it's not important.

[02:12:52.780 --> 02:12:53.420]
And I agree with that.

[02:12:54.140 --> 02:12:57.680]
Three and a half to one at five sixty WQM Booster for Hank at two.

[02:12:57.860 --> 02:13:00.100]
Kimba from six to seven o'clock and a Panthers.

[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:03.340]
The pregame at seven o'clock then at seven thirty turned down the sound on your radio.

[02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:05.460]
It's the Panthers in Penguins on sports channel.

[02:13:06.460 --> 02:13:12.520]
The Neil Roger show now on five sixty WQM Miami Fort Lauderdale.

[02:13:12.620 --> 02:13:14.240]
It's not just the one to two hour.

[02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:15.580]
It's a phenomenon.

[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:22.020]
I want to give you a kiss.

[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:25.460]
She wasn't in town for the president.

[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:27.360]
Really on.

[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:31.060]
She wasn't sure what it meant, but he would show her.

[02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:31.560]
Oh.

[02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:34.260]
She should show her.

[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:39.180]
She took her on a tour of the oval place.

[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:43.800]
And when they were through, we had a biophanace and he said no.

[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:45.580]
No.

[02:13:45.820 --> 02:13:45.820]

[02:13:45.820 --> 02:13:46.260]
No.

[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:49.040]
No.

[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:49.700]
No.

[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:50.000]
No.

[02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:50.680]
No.

[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:50.680]

[02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:51.220]
No.

[02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:51.220]

[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:52.020]
No.

[02:13:52.900 --> 02:13:52.900]

[02:13:53.420 --> 02:13:54.140]
No.

[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:54.160]

[02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:55.300]
No.

[02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:55.860]
No.

[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:55.880]

[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:02.740]
We're down as c**t anywhere to around.

[02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:06.260]
She fell to a knees and she swallowed him down.

[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:07.600]
He said slow.

[02:14:08.860 --> 02:14:08.860]

[02:14:08.860 --> 02:14:09.220]
Slow.

[02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:10.140]
Slow.

[02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:10.500]
Slow.

[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:11.980]
Okay.

[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:13.420]
Slow.

[02:14:13.540 --> 02:14:14.080]
Slow.

[02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:16.380]
Before his bubble burst.

[02:14:16.820 --> 02:14:19.640]
And a little intern had a terrible burst.

[02:14:19.940 --> 02:14:20.960]
He was a slow.

[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:21.880]

[02:14:22.420 --> 02:14:22.680]
Slow.

[02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:23.380]
Slow.

[02:14:23.380 --> 02:14:24.120]
Slow.

[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:26.120]
Slow.

[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:27.360]
Slow.

[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:28.360]

[02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:30.460]
Slow.

[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:31.200]
Slow.

[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:31.240]
Slow.

[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:31.320]
Slow.

[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:32.540]
Slow.

[02:14:34.060 --> 02:14:34.260]
Slow.

[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:34.960]

[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:36.840]
Slow.

[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:40.060]
Well, she's c**t conversations on the phone.

[02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:43.180]
Choking about a billy phone.

[02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:46.860]
And when it came, it had it in his head.

[02:14:47.140 --> 02:14:50.200]
But she said, feeling fine, gonna take the skin.

[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:53.460]
Yeah, that's it, I'm not the world for curious man.

[02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:55.180]
But for what I hear.

[02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:57.920]
I understand she was a g**.

[02:14:59.500 --> 02:15:01.320]
G**, g**, g**, g**, g**.

[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:04.480]
G**, g**, g**, g**.

[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:05.460]
Go, wah.

[02:15:11.020 --> 02:15:12.220]
Flow, wah.

[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:15.680]
Flow, wah.

[02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:15.740]
Slow, wah.

[02:15:17.460 --> 02:15:19.040]
Flow, wah.

[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:24.280]
I have searched, I can't find it.

[02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:27.220]
I'm going to be the perfect song.

[02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:27.960]
I'm going to be playing that.

[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.460]
That's going to be the new answer for the next five or six months.

[02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:31.460]
But I did find.

[02:15:34.500 --> 02:15:36.040]
Hey, it's almost there is appropriate.

[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:37.040]
Huh?

[02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:40.380]
And it's by the capital tunnel.

[02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:41.660]
That's kind of fits inside.

[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:47.560]
Well, it's the only goddamn thing I could find.

[02:15:52.420 --> 02:15:53.060]
Quartz, Quartz.

[02:15:56.700 --> 02:16:01.480]
Okay, three minutes after one at five, 60 WQM, all music all day, all the hits, baby, for the holidays.

[02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:04.580]
Oh, here's a call in the Grove.

[02:16:04.820 --> 02:16:04.940]
Hello.

[02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:06.780]
Hello, now.

[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:07.320]
Yes.

[02:16:07.660 --> 02:16:14.460]
Hey, I tell you, these people in Washington, I don't know what, what, what are they having to brains?

[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:18.340]
You know, they look so much like the old, they've got to brain that problem.

[02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:22.660]
You know, they have, they have the same mentality as the old folks that are here in Domino Park, you know.

[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:24.660]
In fact, Domino Park, I mean, what's up?

[02:16:24.820 --> 02:16:26.860]
Well, you know, having never got blown or blown somebody.

[02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:27.720]
What's wrong with that guy?

[02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:28.060]
I don't know.

[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:29.100]
Both, if you ask me.

[02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:29.500]
Yeah.

[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:31.660]
I've never heard of this guy for a state.

[02:16:32.340 --> 02:16:33.660]
Tomas, yeah, I've been here.

[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:35.340]
Somebody called about him the other day, as a matter of fact.

[02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:36.200]
What's he hockin' now?

[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:37.200]
Did you hear what happened with him?

[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:37.440]
No.

[02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:38.380]
Anyway.

[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:39.740]
But what they said they took him off the air because he was there.

[02:16:39.740 --> 02:16:44.180]
They took him off the air and he, oh, because the guy said, yes, what's wrong with having right

[02:16:44.180 --> 02:16:45.660]
for the case on here in Dave County?

[02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:45.920]
Right.

[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:48.080]
Anyway, so he has, he has a radio station.

[02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:51.000]
Well, it must have been impressed by those 80 banana boat people that showed up in the

[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:51.220]
radio.

[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:53.520]
Well, it's another embarrassing for these stupid assholes.

[02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:53.980]
Uh-huh.

[02:16:54.060 --> 02:16:58.300]
Anyway, so he has a TV show just like the one you had in Watt, Grammy.

[02:16:58.460 --> 02:16:59.020]
Oh, a bad one.

[02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:00.380]
They jacked him out of both places.

[02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:01.360]
How do you like that?

[02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:02.040]
I think he's an opinion.

[02:17:02.740 --> 02:17:03.400]
Isn't that something?

[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:04.440]
I'm freaking believable.

[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:04.620]
Yeah.

[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:05.240]
Well, you're a police.

[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:06.240]
I'm a big ass in Wayne, man.

[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:07.480]
Can you play two bits for me, please?

[02:17:07.580 --> 02:17:07.780]
Okay.

[02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:14.440]
Um, um, if you see K and um, now you, is that a bittersy dispelling it?

[02:17:14.540 --> 02:17:14.900]
Yeah, okay.

[02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:16.120]
No, one more, no.

[02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:16.500]
I won't wait.

[02:17:16.580 --> 02:17:18.060]
What was the other guy that wanted to hear?

[02:17:18.140 --> 02:17:19.740]
Did I play that thing that I did?

[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:20.300]
Okay, go ahead.

[02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:24.120]
And what's the one we lost Liberty or, um, freedom's dead?

[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:24.660]
Freedom's dead.

[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:25.220]
Freedom's dead.

[02:17:25.380 --> 02:17:25.460]
Perfect.

[02:17:25.740 --> 02:17:25.900]
Excellent.

[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:26.460]
Thanks, buddy.

[02:17:26.540 --> 02:17:26.740]
Okay.

[02:17:27.260 --> 02:17:29.300]
Well, I better play this box as I think you would say.

[02:17:29.420 --> 02:17:31.580]
And if you see that, it's at the sky or high.

[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:33.080]
And it's at the sky or low dot or end.

[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:33.800]
Okay, et cetera.

[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:36.360]
I had a chip named K.

[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:42.400]
One day she flew away to Tijuana, where the movie is?

[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:44.600]
The movie is the movie.

[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:47.100]
Well, I did all right in the censorship.

[02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:49.740]
There are words in mustn't slip.

[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:53.540]
Who do we tell you how I feel for K?

[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:55.540]
That's it for K.

[02:17:56.660 --> 02:17:57.060]
Oh.

[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:06.040]
If you see K and K, you wanna, that's the U of T, you wanna, too.

[02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:10.820]
Now it's your CK, tell her I miss her, he's safe.

[02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:13.780]
And the FCC won't let me sing this.

[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:18.060]
So I'll night roll, she's day now, if you see K, take her hand.

[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:23.160]
Tell me, say, that after this transmission, I'll be out in 90 days.

[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:29.760]
Oh, if you see K and K, then I'll see you with Tijuana.

[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:33.920]
Go, wanna, go, fuck out of T with Tijuana.

[02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:34.600]
Go!

[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:40.680]
It works for a road trip in the basket.

[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:43.000]
Yeah.

[02:18:43.940 --> 02:18:45.320]
Six minutes after one.

[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:48.180]
Mr. One, all music all day.

[02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:50.100]
It's the Larks and the Jerk, baby.

[02:18:50.460 --> 02:18:52.120]
They're Jerk and it's Washington's word.

[02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:53.680]
Yeah, they're doing it.

[02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:56.700]
Oh yeah.

[02:18:56.780 --> 02:18:59.420]
I gotta get a copy of Mitch Ryder, Devil with a Blue Dress on.

[02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:01.540]
Absolutely positive, they got it ahead of me before.

[02:19:01.780 --> 02:19:03.100]
We gotta have that for tomorrow, baby.

[02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:06.340]
If I gotta go out and buy it myself and the song, too.

[02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:09.060]
Okay, here's a taberniere. Hello.

[02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:10.480]
Good afternoon, Nia.

[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:10.940]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:11.020 --> 02:19:11.560]
Buenos Tullia.

[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:12.220]
Buenos dias.

[02:19:13.380 --> 02:19:16.940]
Listen, there's absolute proof that they're hypocritical last night.

[02:19:17.420 --> 02:19:20.940]
When they were talking today, Chase, they asked them...

[02:19:20.940 --> 02:19:24.980]
Chris Shazier, Connecticut, who put on a charade for everybody last night.

[02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:32.180]
He made a statement that, well, I was against it, but if he talks to me, I might be swayed if he could be apologizing.

[02:19:32.740 --> 02:19:35.280]
And he got asked, if you don't have grounds for...

[02:19:35.780 --> 02:19:40.300]
If you don't have grounds for impeachment, how's him coming out and admitting it?

[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:40.640]
Yeah.

[02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:41.560]
Going to change it.

[02:19:41.660 --> 02:19:43.440]
You don't have a legitimate grounds for...

[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:44.380]
It's interesting.

[02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:50.440]
These are the people before that were saying he was playing some magical games like it depends on what is, is, and what he was.

[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:54.440]
But now it's like, if he says that he misled the people, and he was...

[02:19:55.060 --> 02:19:57.080]
He's got to use the word purgeery, okay?

[02:19:57.260 --> 02:19:57.380]
Right.

[02:19:57.380 --> 02:20:00.300]
And then if he says purgeery, then they'll say, he's got to use some other word.

[02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:03.360]
I mean, what the hell difference does it make? We all know what happened. We're all like adults.

[02:20:03.580 --> 02:20:04.320]
You and the kids are adults.

[02:20:04.380 --> 02:20:07.920]
He's not getting away with anything. If he did something wrong, he'll do it after the president.

[02:20:08.020 --> 02:20:08.180]
Right.

[02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:09.980]
And then I saw this guy outside the...

[02:20:09.980 --> 02:20:12.400]
He's the favorite laundry girl anyway to clean that damn dress.

[02:20:12.780 --> 02:20:12.960]
Right.

[02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:15.540]
Have you ever seen this guy Gary Bauer?

[02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:18.040]
Oh, is he a frightening twiglet eye or what?

[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:18.640]
He's not real.

[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:19.180]
Move!

[02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:20.060]
He's from another side.

[02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:21.640]
Why would I, would I swastika, baby?

[02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:24.380]
Yeah, isn't this guy reed? The guy that put him up to this?

[02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:26.640]
Now Ralph Reed is like, he's the small potatoes now.

[02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:31.040]
Oh, I mean, this is scary. He's about to look at this guy. I looked at many eyes. They're marbles there.

[02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:32.700]
Even Papa Bauer is nervous about him.

[02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:33.360]
It's scary.

[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:33.940]
Okay, probably.

[02:20:33.940 --> 02:20:34.920]
Well, he'll have a happy holiday.

[02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:36.420]
See you with the little Papa Porto.

[02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:36.900]
Okay.

[02:20:37.020 --> 02:20:38.620]
Okay. We have an open-line in Broward.

[02:20:38.740 --> 02:20:42.160]
5'6, 7'0, 5'60", 5'60", on the AT&T wireless light.

[02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:47.660]
Boy, I like this song a lot.

[02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:50.840]
The Joe Jeffrey groove.

[02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:52.280]
How are they doing? Have you heard from them lately?

[02:20:52.560 --> 02:20:53.440]
No. They'll be back.

[02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:54.860]
Don't think we'd back?

[02:20:55.080 --> 02:20:55.280]
No.

[02:20:55.960 --> 02:20:58.280]
Come on already, Jesus. It's only a four-hour show.

[02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:00.600]
I woke up this morning, baby.

[02:21:00.900 --> 02:21:01.200]
Right.

[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:05.120]
I'm just one of my...

[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:06.940]
I woke up this morning, baby.

[02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:10.100]
Listen, I'm not sure all the trouble to dig into these old ACDs. I might as well, you know,

[02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:12.080]
put a few seconds on there, something that I like.

[02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:15.780]
Can't find the devil with the blue rest on.

[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:17.960]
That's Monica Lewinsky. Make no mistake about it.

[02:21:18.100 --> 02:21:20.360]
She is the devil with the blue rest on.

[02:21:20.500 --> 02:21:21.260]
The horn devil.

[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:23.280]
When they say the devil was horny, that's what they said.

[02:21:24.300 --> 02:21:26.840]
And I bet you're under those 600 pounds of study light.

[02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:28.920]
I bet you she's got horn somewhere, okay?

[02:21:30.420 --> 02:21:32.440]
Monica Lewinsky, the bitch that brought...

[02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:34.080]
That she brought the president down?

[02:21:34.180 --> 02:21:34.900]
That's f***ing bit.

[02:21:35.060 --> 02:21:35.920]
In more ways than one.

[02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:39.360]
Misrable, miserable jab.

[02:21:40.360 --> 02:22:04.240]
sinner off the spacecraft.

[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:05.500]
omsai forbid that has simply only hungry...,

[02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:05.500]

[02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:08.120]
The creates them would be tastelessly appetizing to spit on you once again.

[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:08.120]

[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:08.440]
Uhhhhhhh hghhh.

[02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:09.340]
Maryf pare rryουμε

[02:22:09.340 --> 02:22:10.820]
And the sea.

[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:18.380]
Breathe in, breathe in, and very high.

[02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:20.400]
Listen to me, man.

[02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:25.680]
Breathe in, breathe in, and very high.

[02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:36.120]
Live!

[02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:42.740]
這樣的 music is right, i should say.

[02:22:44.620 --> 02:22:46.200]
That's what they are consisting of people, who are getting

[02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:47.920]
the whole Congress at the same year.

[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:50.480]
They brought some of them up and bringing them there

[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:52.260]
in shackles and chains.

[02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:54.840]
And having eggs, like crying and waiting, like Jimmy swagired.

[02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:57.000]
And the whole uh, it's Congress in just singing.

[02:22:58.120 --> 02:22:58.520]
Yeah.

[02:22:59.740 --> 02:23:00.140]
Yeah.

[02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:00.720]

[02:23:01.420 --> 02:23:03.260]
I can't make it just for you.

[02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:04.540]
And the Kurobaka is doing it.

[02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:06.000]
Get out of here already.

[02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:07.100]
Spitting Beatles routine.

[02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:07.700]
I like that.

[02:23:07.780 --> 02:23:09.740]
That was another medley of their smash and other one hit group.

[02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:10.560]
1961.

[02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:11.520]

[02:23:11.740 --> 02:23:11.940]
Four?

[02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:13.480]
Huh?

[02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:14.880]
Three, four or something like that.

[02:23:15.380 --> 02:23:15.660]
Okay.

[02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:16.180]
Where are we going?

[02:23:16.280 --> 02:23:17.800]
Here's a mobile in North Miami Beach.

[02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:18.000]
Hello?

[02:23:19.180 --> 02:23:20.280]
Neil, how you doing?

[02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:20.660]
Great.

[02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:23.640]
Uh, bought one of your CDs first off.

[02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:24.200]
Thank you.

[02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:25.760]
It was an excellent CD.

[02:23:25.940 --> 02:23:26.380]
Thank you.

[02:23:26.420 --> 02:23:27.640]
I love those charities.

[02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:28.340]
It was excellent.

[02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:29.060]
Well, you're welcome.

[02:23:30.820 --> 02:23:33.340]
Um, you know, what's going on with these Republicans?

[02:23:33.380 --> 02:23:40.400]
What I'm trying to want to figure out is logically, what are they trying to accomplish with all their...

[02:23:40.400 --> 02:23:41.780]
When in doubt they want them out.

[02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:42.960]
They want him out.

[02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:44.280]
If it's the last thing they do.

[02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:47.180]
And now I think this last election instead of teaching them a lesson,

[02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:50.100]
what it did was make them even angrier and more furious.

[02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:54.000]
And now they're determined as long as they got this last month that they can do their dirty damage,

[02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.280]
now they're going to do their damage to get them out.

[02:23:56.740 --> 02:23:57.740]
What if they're going to release you?

[02:23:57.840 --> 02:23:59.380]
Drag him through another major ordeal.

[02:23:59.740 --> 02:24:01.400]
So what are they trying...

[02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:02.280]
What are they counting on?

[02:24:02.380 --> 02:24:05.460]
Now we have short memories that we won't remember any of them.

[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:06.660]
That's exactly right.

[02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:08.440]
Well, this is sad.

[02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:09.620]
This is a sad situation.

[02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:14.320]
You know, Mayor Lincoln, New York City's mayor, made a great comment on, uh,

[02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:17.880]
for all the other day on, uh, for all the revaders, yeah.

[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:25.880]
He said, as Clinton would have been stopped doing 55 and a 50 mile an hour, you know,

[02:24:26.020 --> 02:24:27.060]
street trap.

[02:24:27.320 --> 02:24:27.420]
Right.

[02:24:27.580 --> 02:24:29.800]
He would have said, no, I was only doing 49.

[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:31.500]
Yeah, yeah, I saw that.

[02:24:31.940 --> 02:24:33.420]
Would we have tried to impeach him?

[02:24:33.940 --> 02:24:35.800]
The Republicans would have been glad he was lying.

[02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:36.300]
That's right.

[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:37.440]
Lying under oath.

[02:24:38.020 --> 02:24:42.300]
This is the whole process of this wonderful moral, you know,

[02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:45.200]
and I love the, uh, I love the, uh,

[02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:51.060]
the group of people who's doing all this to, you know, this is such a wonderful,

[02:24:52.220 --> 02:24:53.100]
powerful moral, right?

[02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:53.520]
That's right.

[02:24:53.620 --> 02:24:54.080]
That's right.

[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:55.120]
Who never stole a freight train.

[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:56.400]
They only screwed around a lot.

[02:24:56.540 --> 02:24:57.240]
Okay, listen, pal.

[02:24:57.320 --> 02:24:57.700]
Good luck to you.

[02:24:57.760 --> 02:24:58.180]
Good new phone.

[02:24:58.580 --> 02:25:02.060]
Okay, we have an open line in Broward 567-0560, pound 560.

[02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:05.820]
On the AT&T wireless line.

[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:07.720]
Oh, boy.

[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:09.380]
Thank God they got that hockey game tonight.

[02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:10.900]
Are we whipped up into a friendship about that?

[02:25:11.020 --> 02:25:11.140]
No.

[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:11.840]
You know, I'm sure.

[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:13.340]
Bob, we got Mike Lang is here with us.

[02:25:13.420 --> 02:25:14.060]
Pittsburgh Penguins.

[02:25:14.180 --> 02:25:14.740]
How are you doing, Mike?

[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:16.500]
Saw that game last night.

[02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:17.560]
Pretty coma inducing.

[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:22.740]
They just look at a blue and two nothing lead against the Tampa ball teams against a whole redness against the girls team.

[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:24.220]
Oh, snooze inducing.

[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:25.720]
Snooze inducing.

[02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:27.300]
Marty Strachel look great last night.

[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:29.660]
Oh, and Alexei Morozov.

[02:25:29.660 --> 02:25:30.320]
He looked pretty good.

[02:25:30.500 --> 02:25:31.080]
Other than that.

[02:25:31.460 --> 02:25:33.080]
And Robert Lang, he got a nice cooler.

[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:35.180]
And then they blew it and they had to go in overtime.

[02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:36.720]
And Kevin Hatch got a greasy cooler.

[02:25:36.860 --> 02:25:38.780]
And they pulled it out against Tampa 3 to 2.

[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:39.720]
The penguins.

[02:25:40.980 --> 02:25:46.240]
Who had 11,000 some out there in the civic arena last night, even though they got that $20 million loan from the foreign bank.

[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:47.860]
And they can just as quick out their payroll.

[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:49.820]
You mark my words.

[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:50.560]
I'm telling you.

[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:53.500]
I'm the one I told you about the right wing bloodless coup takeover.

[02:25:53.620 --> 02:25:54.120]
You laughed at me.

[02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:55.180]
You thought I was exaggerating.

[02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:56.300]
I was whipping up in the frenzy.

[02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:57.460]
I told you that years ago.

[02:25:57.500 --> 02:25:58.680]
And here we are on the eve of it.

[02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:00.420]
We're on the press of piece of it right now.

[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:05.060]
And I also told you about sports about five years ago about how they were shooting themselves in the feet.

[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:08.760]
And they were going to destroy everything that they build up with these crazy salaries.

[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:11.420]
And with their goddamn greed and show enough here we are.

[02:26:12.620 --> 02:26:15.540]
Playing games up there in Carolina with a pretty good team by the way.

[02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:17.880]
They won again last night with a shutoff three nothing over Edmunds.

[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:22.620]
And pretty good team those hero coons playing in front of like 1500, 600, 900 people a game.

[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:23.680]
Nice call.

[02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:25.200]
I'm Gary Betman. You jackass.

[02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:28.700]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[02:26:28.980 --> 02:26:29.400]
Yeah.

[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:30.420]
Yes, sir. How you doing?

[02:26:30.580 --> 02:26:30.820]
Great.

[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:34.280]
Want to get your opinion on something less serious than the Clinton scandal.

[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:35.560]
Probably just as comical.

[02:26:35.820 --> 02:26:36.020]
Yeah.

[02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:38.620]
The whole thing with you and more and crying.

[02:26:38.620 --> 02:26:40.280]
Have they mismanaged their money?

[02:26:40.540 --> 02:26:42.200]
How they how they are agents to this?

[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:43.200]
How they're over descending?

[02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:44.200]
Yeah.

[02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:47.500]
I can't stand the eye hope that the A never comes back.

[02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:48.440]
And I'm not basketball.

[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:50.840]
I'm going to tell you after we finish our center one campaign.

[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:53.400]
I'm going to take up a fundraiser for Alonzo.

[02:26:53.620 --> 02:26:54.700]
The hell I like saying.

[02:26:55.100 --> 02:26:56.200]
The hell was though.

[02:26:56.380 --> 02:26:56.560]
Yeah.

[02:26:57.040 --> 02:26:59.060]
And I don't not only that, but now he's got it.

[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:00.980]
They got to start with this racist bull crap again.

[02:27:01.100 --> 02:27:01.640]
Oh, what a threat.

[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:04.200]
90% of the goddamn players in the league are black.

[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:05.740]
They're all overpaid millionaires.

[02:27:05.900 --> 02:27:09.180]
OK, but it's a racial thing because the owners are saying enough crap already.

[02:27:09.420 --> 02:27:11.280]
Don't they always use the race card when they need to?

[02:27:11.300 --> 02:27:12.280]
Every single time.

[02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:15.280]
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if John and Cochrane get to back into this.

[02:27:15.540 --> 02:27:16.900]
Oh, I can't stand that asshole.

[02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:17.220]
Yeah.

[02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:21.780]
I think Larry King and Lope with Ross P. Row is the best man.

[02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:23.780]
But I just find it ridiculous how morning's bitching.

[02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:24.400]
He should be lucky.

[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:27.140]
He's not a regular guy working for $30,000 delivering.

[02:27:27.220 --> 02:27:31.520]
No, he should kiss the ground that he's not the one saying fries with that.

[02:27:31.620 --> 02:27:33.520]
You know, in McDonald's when you go through the drive-through,

[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:34.480]
that's what he should be doing.

[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:35.460]
And what about you and the ground?

[02:27:35.660 --> 02:27:36.160]
What about you?

[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:37.180]
Yeah, what about him?

[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:39.020]
I think he's going to be spending the whole summer at the New York

[02:27:39.020 --> 02:27:40.380]
Museum of Natural History.

[02:27:40.460 --> 02:27:41.880]
Did you hear what Kobe Bryant couldn't do?

[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:42.700]
They're missing a link.

[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:47.420]
He couldn't eat lobster because he has to watch his money expenditures now.

[02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:47.920]
Exactly.

[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:52.700]
He's only making 18 million a year this big shfoll and he's got to watch his budget.

[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:53.940]
I can't stand it.

[02:27:53.980 --> 02:27:54.860]
I hope the whole season is it.

[02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:55.780]
I hope they never come back.

[02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:58.340]
Let's allow them stand on the three corners with a cup, OK?

[02:27:58.660 --> 02:27:59.560]
Let me tell you something, Neil.

[02:27:59.600 --> 02:27:59.760]
Yeah.

[02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:00.820]
You know what, though?

[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:02.100]
The same thing is going to happen with baseball.

[02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:03.860]
What do I mean, going to happen?

[02:28:03.860 --> 02:28:05.160]
It's already, they killed it.

[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:08.180]
When they did the Kevin Brown deal the other day, that was the end of baseball.

[02:28:08.380 --> 02:28:09.520]
That was the end.

[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:12.360]
I think the end happened in 96 when they gave, I mean,

[02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:15.800]
I just, one was it would an Albert Bell sign that one deal for eight million a year.

[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:15.940]
Yeah.

[02:28:15.940 --> 02:28:16.860]
But with the white stock.

[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:17.160]
Right.

[02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:18.460]
That's when it all started.

[02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:21.560]
Albert Bell, that disgusting man.

[02:28:21.700 --> 02:28:23.540]
A not just a crap disderber, right?

[02:28:24.260 --> 02:28:26.020]
They're going to give back that eight million.

[02:28:26.460 --> 02:28:27.360]
What's Kevin Brown work?

[02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:28.560]
He's actually a good citizen.

[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:29.740]
Any bus is out playing.

[02:28:29.940 --> 02:28:30.120]
Yeah.

[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:33.100]
If anyone deserves the money throughout, but no one deserves 15 million.

[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:34.640]
You know, Hank, the Bahag made a good point.

[02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:37.660]
Kevin Brown made $3 million two years ago in this town.

[02:28:37.900 --> 02:28:39.840]
He's won 20 games once in his career.

[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:43.180]
He won zero games in the world series last year against the Yankees.

[02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:47.320]
He's worth $15 million a year for a guy that plays every four or five days.

[02:28:47.380 --> 02:28:48.120]
Oh, I disagree.

[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:51.300]
But if anyone's going to get it, even though Kevin Brown never won.

[02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:52.040]
Sure, let me tell you.

[02:28:52.100 --> 02:28:52.920]
They're all going to get it.

[02:28:53.020 --> 02:28:53.200]
OK?

[02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:54.980]
You know where they're going to get it right in the old press me.

[02:28:54.980 --> 02:28:55.260]
Right, go.

[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:56.860]
And that's going to be a themicand dance.

[02:28:56.960 --> 02:28:57.600]
We can have a party.

[02:28:57.980 --> 02:28:59.120]
What happened with sports, Neil?

[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:00.760]
What's going to happen with sports?

[02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:03.280]
Well, we'll find something else to do like orgies, something like that.

[02:29:04.020 --> 02:29:05.120]
Something more entertaining.

[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:08.920]
And like I started to say about that game last time at Pittsburgh in the Tampa Bay.

[02:29:09.180 --> 02:29:12.040]
I mean, snooze inducing the one of those people stayed home.

[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:14.860]
I mean, comatose, coma inducing.

[02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:16.660]
Very, very weak.

[02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:21.100]
Overpaid jocks, very, very bad entertainment most of the time.

[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:24.480]
And we're supposed to pay big bucks and pretend that we're really enthused.

[02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:25.600]
That's why they keep going.

[02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:28.120]
I got to keep playing God and Gary Glitter over and over again.

[02:29:28.120 --> 02:29:32.440]
Because if it just depended on what we're actually seeing out there for the price they were paying

[02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:36.240]
and the overpriced food, most of it could put you in a longer fan link.

[02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:36.780]
OK?

[02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:38.180]
Yeah, here we go.

[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.220]
Give it a rest already.

[02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:41.740]
Kill it.

[02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:42.380]
Shoot it.

[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:44.120]
Thank you.

[02:29:45.940 --> 02:29:46.340]
God.

[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:49.660]
I'm not even going to do it.

[02:29:49.700 --> 02:29:51.700]
We have an open-line in Broward 5, 6, 7.

[02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:52.580]
How are we doing on that thing?

[02:29:52.660 --> 02:29:52.900]
That's right.

[02:29:53.260 --> 02:29:53.260]

[02:29:53.740 --> 02:29:54.280]
There you go.

[02:29:54.420 --> 02:29:55.160]
Slow but sure.

[02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:59.000]
We're not going to do like two grand today, but we'll do close to a thousand bucks out of that.

[02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:02.920]
Which by the way, that amount puts us, what did I do with that thing?

[02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:05.300]
Yeah, that puts us well over 98 grand.

[02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:07.260]
And we're talking about actual monies in hand.

[02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:10.900]
This doesn't count like yesterday today and the Monday at the borders.

[02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:13.840]
And whatever else coming down the internet, neo-ranges.com.

[02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:16.840]
And direct mail orders from center one five.

[02:30:17.140 --> 02:30:17.720]
What is it?

[02:30:17.720 --> 02:30:21.300]
5, 6, 3, 3, 6, 100, 9, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 100.

[02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:22.960]
So put that all together.

[02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:24.880]
We're going to go away over 100 grand.

[02:30:25.220 --> 02:30:25.800]
Thank you.

[02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:28.920]
And thank you profusely for really getting off your ass and doing it here with the best of neo-stuff.

[02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:32.640]
No fill Henry stuff, no recon-tudge stuff, no best of a gildy stuff.

[02:30:33.060 --> 02:30:39.020]
And somehow all by ourselves here, George, we managed to put this stuff together to get this thing on the road

[02:30:39.020 --> 02:30:42.560]
and to force some momentum here and we'll raise over 100 grand.

[02:30:43.180 --> 02:30:44.600]
So where's the yet?

[02:30:45.660 --> 02:30:46.260]
Where's who at?

[02:30:46.460 --> 02:30:46.600]
Chris?

[02:30:46.600 --> 02:30:47.360]
I don't know.

[02:30:47.780 --> 02:30:50.500]
Corner University and Broward Boulevard there in the Shell Station.

[02:30:50.500 --> 02:30:52.180]
Hey look, don't start pushing, okay?

[02:30:52.400 --> 02:30:52.980]
Enough is enough.

[02:30:53.400 --> 02:30:54.540]
Don't get the pushy, Chris.

[02:30:54.920 --> 02:30:55.040]
What?

[02:30:57.940 --> 02:31:00.460]
I guess you didn't hear about Tracy doing more than one job here.

[02:31:00.580 --> 02:31:00.900]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[02:31:01.320 --> 02:31:01.960]
Where are we going?

[02:31:02.100 --> 02:31:02.720]
Here's Miami.

[02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:03.100]
Hello.

[02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:05.120]
Miami.

[02:31:06.340 --> 02:31:06.940]
Buenos dias.

[02:31:07.640 --> 02:31:08.160]
Are we there, Jay?

[02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:08.840]
Up your ass.

[02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:12.340]
Okay, we have an open line at day five, six, seven, oh five, six, five, six, five, six,

[02:31:12.340 --> 02:31:13.740]
and one of the most interesting on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:31:14.040 --> 02:31:15.500]
Thanks for waiting in Miami, by the way.

[02:31:15.700 --> 02:31:17.280]
I guess it was time for the dominoe game, huh?

[02:31:18.460 --> 02:31:19.640]
Here's a mobile-informed Myers.

[02:31:19.800 --> 02:31:19.940]
Hello.

[02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:21.820]
Yeah, hi.

[02:31:21.940 --> 02:31:22.480]
This is Scott.

[02:31:22.760 --> 02:31:23.140]
Yes, Scott.

[02:31:23.960 --> 02:31:25.580]
I'm not sure what you thought.

[02:31:25.760 --> 02:31:28.460]
I agree with you completely on your sports ideas.

[02:31:29.460 --> 02:31:30.800]
Baseball is already dead.

[02:31:31.020 --> 02:31:31.220]
Yeah.

[02:31:31.700 --> 02:31:35.360]
And basketball, they're in deep trouble.

[02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:36.100]
They're in deep trouble.

[02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:36.800]
Yes, but...

[02:31:36.800 --> 02:31:37.640]
You better stay hard.

[02:31:37.840 --> 02:31:41.600]
But as far as Monica being a devil and a blue dress,

[02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:44.980]
I know the Lewinsky fan, but I mean, how can you say that?

[02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:47.800]
And not blame Clinton, at least a little bit.

[02:31:47.860 --> 02:31:48.860]
He was there, too.

[02:31:49.040 --> 02:31:49.760]
blame him for what?

[02:31:49.940 --> 02:31:50.760]
She went there with it.

[02:31:50.860 --> 02:31:51.920]
She bragged it on the tapes.

[02:31:52.060 --> 02:31:52.760]
Haven't you heard the tapes?

[02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:55.560]
Haven't you read the transcripts that she went there with her presidential knee pads?

[02:31:55.840 --> 02:31:58.360]
And she dressed provocatively, knowing that he was a real momentizer?

[02:31:58.680 --> 02:32:01.380]
And she went there to walk away up on her knees?

[02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:02.640]
Yeah, all right.

[02:32:02.700 --> 02:32:03.640]
He didn't want to say no.

[02:32:03.740 --> 02:32:04.460]
He liked...

[02:32:04.460 --> 02:32:06.300]
He's married to an ice princess.

[02:32:06.460 --> 02:32:07.640]
He's married to a frigid bitch.

[02:32:07.740 --> 02:32:09.400]
Okay, he wants to get those locks off.

[02:32:10.240 --> 02:32:11.200]
What's wrong with the president?

[02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:12.640]
I want to get off the owner, huh?

[02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:14.120]
I'm not a fan of Hillary.

[02:32:14.120 --> 02:32:14.880]
No, there you go.

[02:32:15.100 --> 02:32:20.080]
They haven't had sex in 14 years, and you wonder why this guy is horny all the time?

[02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:22.480]
Well, then, feel a little more discreet about it.

[02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:24.620]
Man, don't be doing it in the Oval Office for a second.

[02:32:24.620 --> 02:32:26.900]
You know, he thought it was the oral office.

[02:32:27.020 --> 02:32:27.440]
He's from Arkansas.

[02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:28.640]
He don't know how to spell it.

[02:32:28.660 --> 02:32:29.120]
Okay, pal.

[02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:29.820]
He'll have a great life.

[02:32:30.340 --> 02:32:31.240]
Get a hotel room.

[02:32:31.340 --> 02:32:31.940]
He don't have time.

[02:32:32.040 --> 02:32:33.040]
He's busy as the president.

[02:32:33.220 --> 02:32:33.440]
Okay?

[02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:35.480]
He's got the secret service following him.

[02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:36.940]
He's got Betty Curry out there going...

[02:32:36.940 --> 02:32:37.680]
Like that.

[02:32:37.900 --> 02:32:38.560]
He don't have time.

[02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:39.600]
He wants to quicky, okay?

[02:32:39.960 --> 02:32:41.080]
Anybody out there ever get a quicky?

[02:32:41.220 --> 02:32:41.820]
Here you go.

[02:32:43.100 --> 02:32:45.420]
And like I said before, nobody wants to be first up to this.

[02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:48.800]
If it wouldn't have been for that goddamn stain on the dress of the DNA evidence, there

[02:32:48.800 --> 02:32:49.740]
would have been none of this.

[02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:51.080]
That's the only thing they had.

[02:32:51.300 --> 02:32:51.800]
They could talk.

[02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:52.360]
All they want.

[02:32:52.520 --> 02:32:55.980]
They could have 20 million pages of reports and bullcrap if they didn't have the dress.

[02:32:56.240 --> 02:32:57.340]
They would be no mess.

[02:32:58.680 --> 02:32:59.140]
That's right.

[02:33:01.480 --> 02:33:05.820]
Two open lines in Dave County, which really pains me tremendously to see the fact that you people

[02:33:05.820 --> 02:33:09.140]
in Dave don't give a crap that your governments are on the verge of being toppled here because

[02:33:09.140 --> 02:33:12.140]
Iliata Ross Layton has got you by the short hairs and you're all brainwashed.

[02:33:12.280 --> 02:33:14.680]
Do you think that she's not screwing around, huh?

[02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:18.260]
I'll guarantee you there might be somebody out there that might touch you.

[02:33:18.260 --> 02:33:21.400]
I probably don't know who they are, but there might be somebody out there that would think about

[02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:21.960]
Diddling her.

[02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:51.940]
560, 560, 05, 60, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50, 05, 50,

[02:33:58.340 --> 02:34:17.580]
05, 50, here's a), uh, a, uh, a, however,

[02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:21.880]
doch like, number, Alice, and cut though, cut the new, I cut the bull...

[02:34:23.380 --> 02:34:29.020]
Well, he's got my butt, who is it? I had quite a lot.

[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:38.840]
Police got my butt, police got my butt, but that's alright with me,

[02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:42.180]
cause it was brave without a quad.

[02:34:42.180 --> 02:34:56.860]
Very brave, but...

[02:34:56.860 --> 02:34:57.420]
Alright.

[02:35:12.180 --> 02:35:14.280]
They're all good.

[02:35:42.180 --> 02:35:44.280]
I don't wish them a Merry Christmas.

[02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:47.640]
I want to wish them a Merry Christmas,

[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:50.340]
I'm smoking all at my time.

[02:35:54.380 --> 02:35:57.160]
Here you go. This one fits in like a rubber glove, baby.

[02:35:57.800 --> 02:35:59.320]
It's Johnny Otter's show.

[02:36:00.460 --> 02:36:02.300]
Look, Roy, the hand-shot's going.

[02:36:02.580 --> 02:36:04.800]
I know, get this way, I will it.

[02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:07.360]
Oh!

[02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:09.760]
Get the cool little fixing rock in, do it.

[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:10.280]
Oh!

[02:36:18.660 --> 02:36:22.140]
There you go, 133-560-WDQM.

[02:36:22.300 --> 02:36:24.680]
Yeah, couldn't they have found a room like at the motel six?

[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:27.300]
Couldn't hold Tom Bodeck taking care of them?

[02:36:27.700 --> 02:36:28.100]
There you go.

[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:35.080]
You have an open line in date, 5-670-560, and 0.56 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:37.360]
Here's a Tamarack, hello.

[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:39.280]
It is my birthday.

[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:40.280]
Yeah.

[02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:42.700]
I was talking with Wayne last Sunday.

[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:43.620]
You what?

[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:45.160]
I was talking with Wayne last Sunday.

[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:47.680]
I can't hear you.

[02:36:47.820 --> 02:36:48.640]
I was talking with Wayne.

[02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:49.780]
You were doing Wayne?

[02:36:49.940 --> 02:36:51.360]
Yes, I was doing Wayne last Sunday.

[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:53.060]
I said with a great half-time show he had.

[02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:56.620]
He said, yeah, the show was good, but what was between it wasn't with a shot.

[02:36:57.240 --> 02:36:57.440]
Yeah.

[02:36:57.800 --> 02:36:58.740]
And that's what he thought about today.

[02:36:58.740 --> 02:37:01.200]
Okay, thank you, and I take away the happy birthday. Take it away.

[02:37:01.820 --> 02:37:03.920]
We have an open line in date, one, and an hour, five, six.

[02:37:04.020 --> 02:37:05.780]
I'm not sure who that was, that was one of the...

[02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:07.000]
I think it was the fact that guy.

[02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:08.160]
Oh no.

[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:10.040]
Oh no.

[02:37:10.740 --> 02:37:11.240]
That guy.

[02:37:11.620 --> 02:37:13.720]
Well, I'll see him at the game tonight, and I'm going to tell him cut the crap.

[02:37:13.900 --> 02:37:14.800]
Okay, I don't think that was him.

[02:37:15.740 --> 02:37:17.300]
No, this guy was even worse than him.

[02:37:17.860 --> 02:37:21.860]
Open line in date, county, 5-670-560, 0.56 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:24.720]
If you move quickly now, national public radio wants your input.

[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:25.420]
Your output.

[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:29.760]
They want to hear the brilliant things that this audience has to say about being on the verge of losing democracy.

[02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:30.140]
Okay?

[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:34.020]
Of losing all of our freedoms and being taken over by a cabal of right-wing lunatics.

[02:37:34.020 --> 02:37:34.440]
Okay?

[02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:36.220]
Anybody concerned about that?

[02:37:36.340 --> 02:37:36.500]
No.

[02:37:36.660 --> 02:37:37.200]
Thank God.

[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:40.260]
Let's get out of the important stuff.

[02:37:40.420 --> 02:37:41.380]
Okay, let's not worry.

[02:37:41.700 --> 02:37:43.800]
Let's not worry about silly little fervulous stuff.

[02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:44.540]
We'll get by this.

[02:37:44.580 --> 02:37:46.020]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:47.460]
Here's North Miami.

[02:37:47.460 --> 02:37:47.880]
Hello.

[02:37:48.180 --> 02:37:48.920]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:49.180]
Great.

[02:37:49.540 --> 02:37:53.560]
I'm a little worried about making this phone call, but I got pissed off enough to make it anyway.

[02:37:53.700 --> 02:37:53.900]
Yeah?

[02:37:54.300 --> 02:37:54.560]
Okay.

[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:57.020]
I know your stance on Christianity.

[02:37:57.020 --> 02:37:58.120]
I've listened to you for years.

[02:37:58.640 --> 02:37:58.820]
Okay?

[02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:00.260]
And I'm a born-of-acrystion.

[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:02.000]
What about all religion in general?

[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:02.400]
I don't know.

[02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:03.040]
I've taken questions.

[02:38:03.100 --> 02:38:04.580]
Although it's an easy target, yes.

[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:08.480]
Let me make a point as a born-again Christian who graduated from a local Bible college.

[02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:09.080]
Okay?

[02:38:09.500 --> 02:38:13.400]
I was told when I was in Bible college, how can you say you're a Christian and be a Democrat?

[02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:20.680]
And my answer to that was, I'd rather roll for a party that gives a crap about people than a party that, just like they're doing now.

[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:21.560]
Well, what does that mean?

[02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:22.700]
How can you be a Christian?

[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:24.000]
What does that mean?

[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:28.120]
That because Rush Limbaugh has taken over Christianity by the most part.

[02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:29.780]
Every Christian I know listens to him.

[02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:31.740]
You think it was God speaking the Moses on the mountain?

[02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:33.820]
In other words, there is no more Republican party.

[02:38:33.980 --> 02:38:34.620]
It's just a religion.

[02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:35.960]
Or is it the other way around?

[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:36.820]
There is no more Christianity.

[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:38.280]
It's just politics.

[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:39.200]
I guess.

[02:38:39.740 --> 02:38:40.760]
What does that come in?

[02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:47.440]
It came with Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell and all these other people who are nothing but Republicans using religion to raise a lot of money,

[02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:54.220]
sneaking the money in the back door to prop up their candidates who will further their programs, their programs, and do their thing.

[02:38:54.220 --> 02:38:57.920]
And abortion and fags and whatever whatever the agenda is, that's what it's all about.

[02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.780]
The Christian coalition has a bunch of crap.

[02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:00.480]
Of course.

[02:39:00.600 --> 02:39:03.320]
Christians should be individuals who vote individually.

[02:39:03.580 --> 02:39:03.740]
Yeah.

[02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:04.680]
Individually.

[02:39:04.980 --> 02:39:06.580]
And I look at all the hypocrites.

[02:39:06.580 --> 02:39:12.560]
Well, you know something when you look at this last election evidently they are because a lot of those born again, fanatic candidates all took it right up the old uh...

[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:13.080]
How rectum?

[02:39:13.220 --> 02:39:13.600]
That's right.

[02:39:13.740 --> 02:39:16.080]
Well, look at the hypocrites that are pointing the finger Clinton.

[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:16.700]
Yeah.

[02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:19.520]
Who set Monaco and whiskey there to begin with?

[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:22.860]
You look at the guy who the uh...

[02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:25.080]
Not Henry had the star.

[02:39:25.620 --> 02:39:25.900]
Yeah.

[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:30.560]
Conflict of interest between their law office and Paula Jones office.

[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:30.660]
Right.

[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:32.560]
You look at all the bullcrapces going on.

[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:38.620]
And they just glossed that over just like they glossed all the leaks over just like they glossed the illegal taping by a delineate trip.

[02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:44.640]
All of their stuff that made you just glosses over, we hear a little bit about it every few weeks and then it just goes into the background and it will work.

[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:46.500]
And we keep putting the spotlight on again.

[02:39:46.620 --> 02:39:50.480]
He didn't use the right word. He pissed them off. He didn't say perjury. He didn't say this.

[02:39:50.980 --> 02:39:53.400]
And we just, they talk about him playing the semantical games.

[02:39:53.580 --> 02:39:56.740]
They're all playing semantical games with the future of the goddamn government in the world.

[02:39:56.800 --> 02:39:58.840]
And in the meantime, we got this lunatic over there.

[02:39:58.980 --> 02:40:03.040]
I've built them all kinds of chemical and nuclear weapons over there and bagged that.

[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:04.840]
And we're sitting here talking about blow jobs.

[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:05.480]
Listen to this.

[02:40:05.860 --> 02:40:06.500]
They're here for a bit.

[02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:09.120]
Thank God there's no blow jobs at those Christian schools by the way.

[02:40:09.380 --> 02:40:10.660]
Every one, while you're the raw son.

[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:11.440]
Oh, well.

[02:40:11.620 --> 02:40:14.580]
Every one of them.

[02:40:14.580 --> 02:40:17.900]
They're almost every one of them that's ready to impeach is a hypocrite.

[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:18.820]
Almost every one of them.

[02:40:18.820 --> 02:40:18.960]
Yeah.

[02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:20.200]
And let me show you one thing.

[02:40:20.340 --> 02:40:21.260]
Let me tell you one thing.

[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:21.520]
Yeah.

[02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:23.640]
What they're doing that they call themselves Christians.

[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:24.320]
Okay.

[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:26.920]
They're contradicting the Bible to begin with.

[02:40:27.140 --> 02:40:28.800]
And all I have to do is look at Romans.

[02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:30.140]
Do you know you got your Bible there?

[02:40:30.180 --> 02:40:30.740]
Look for it.

[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:31.940]
Romans chapter 13.

[02:40:31.940 --> 02:40:32.280]
Yeah.

[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:33.360]
And it's on politics.

[02:40:33.780 --> 02:40:35.360]
And we're not supposed to be involved in.

[02:40:35.380 --> 02:40:36.340]
I know my Romans, man.

[02:40:36.620 --> 02:40:37.860]
We're not supposed to be involved in.

[02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:39.280]
Romans chapter 13.

[02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:39.660]
Yeah.

[02:40:39.740 --> 02:40:42.480]
And this is a bunch of crap that makes me sick to my stuff.

[02:40:42.500 --> 02:40:43.000]
Uh-huh.

[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:43.800]
It really does.

[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:44.520]
I believe it.

[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:45.660]
And you know what?

[02:40:46.020 --> 02:40:49.340]
Wait until, wait two years from now, that be all, all Democrat.

[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:51.920]
Get every one of them pieces of crap out of there.

[02:40:51.940 --> 02:40:52.920]
Oh, it's going to be overwhelming.

[02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:54.700]
It'll be a landslide no matter what happened.

[02:40:54.740 --> 02:40:57.300]
Even if they wind up getting them out of office, they will guarantee.

[02:40:57.500 --> 02:40:58.620]
Girl will be in there for eight years.

[02:40:58.620 --> 02:41:00.580]
And you're going to have an overwhelmingly a Democratic Congress.

[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:03.320]
And like you've the guy said before, maybe it's a blessing in this guy.

[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:06.360]
And I was leaning towards what you were saying about Bush and Texas.

[02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:06.960]
Yeah.

[02:41:07.060 --> 02:41:07.780]
That George Bush.

[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:09.220]
And forget it.

[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:10.040]
He's blown it.

[02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:12.520]
Well, since all of us, they're going to go to hell anyway.

[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:13.640]
We might as well forget about him.

[02:41:13.900 --> 02:41:15.000]
Okay, God bless you, sir.

[02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:17.520]
Okay, 22 before two.

[02:41:17.580 --> 02:41:17.880]
That's right.

[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:19.660]
There's no blow jobs in those religious.

[02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:20.480]
It's a fact.

[02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:21.160]
It's a true.

[02:41:21.220 --> 02:41:21.700]
It's Jim Baker.

[02:41:21.820 --> 02:41:22.260]
He'll tell you.

[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:23.940]
Why, weiner doesn't whistle.

[02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:35.740]
It's a good question.

[02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:37.220]
Those are games you play.

[02:41:37.740 --> 02:41:40.360]
It's not so very hard to do.

[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.920]
The name of the game is the Bible.

[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:47.020]
That's the human purpose and the way we do.

[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:49.040]
The people you know the way.

[02:41:50.340 --> 02:41:52.880]
If I jump into your house.

[02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:56.060]
Make that possession the way.

[02:41:57.500 --> 02:41:59.660]
And then you burn it down.

[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.760]
You can get somebody to believe anything.

[02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:08.640]
If you make the Bible say it's true.

[02:42:09.540 --> 02:42:13.000]
No matter what you do, you can be the reason.

[02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:15.600]
The Lord's the lowest forget you.

[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:17.540]
Think up a poison in his name.

[02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:21.160]
And I will say, wave it all around.

[02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:22.780]
Okay.

[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:24.440]
Find the fortune's limit.

[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:26.380]
The Bible says,

[02:42:26.580 --> 02:42:28.160]
And shoot a doctor down.

[02:42:28.980 --> 02:42:30.900]
Everybody clean water with me.

[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:31.500]
Okay.

[02:42:36.100 --> 02:42:38.820]
Come on, you dumbass publicer.

[02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:45.980]
Feet the tribe out of your kid.

[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:49.780]
Your do the right of the doubt.

[02:42:49.780 --> 02:42:51.780]
The Bible says,

[02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:56.840]
And it's not the Bible says.

[02:42:57.060 --> 02:42:58.340]
The Bible says,

[02:42:58.760 --> 02:42:58.760]

[02:42:58.760 --> 02:42:59.360]
And it's not the Bible says.

[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:01.880]
The Bible says,

[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:02.320]
And it's not the Bible says.

[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:03.320]
You make a sacrifice.

[02:43:04.940 --> 02:43:06.060]
Yeah, not so many years ago.

[02:43:06.480 --> 02:43:09.240]
Richard Diggery and Jerry Fallwell and Amoral majority.

[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:10.440]
Any oral majority.

[02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:13.300]
And then Pat Robertson and they used all of these tax exempt funds

[02:43:13.300 --> 02:43:15.340]
that they're getting because it's under the name of religion.

[02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:16.720]
And it's got nothing to do with religion.

[02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:18.100]
It's got nothing to do with Christianity.

[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:19.500]
It's got to do with politics.

[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:19.880]
Okay.

[02:43:20.020 --> 02:43:21.300]
It's got to do with agenda.

[02:43:22.180 --> 02:43:23.400]
The right wing agenda.

[02:43:24.600 --> 02:43:27.500]
And now all of a sudden, like overnight, they, you know, they had a,

[02:43:27.500 --> 02:43:29.900]
they had a foothold in there and then it kept getting stronger and stronger.

[02:43:29.900 --> 02:43:33.040]
And we woke up one day and voila, they take it over it entirely.

[02:43:33.380 --> 02:43:34.880]
One of the two major parties in this country.

[02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:36.280]
Now, it's total takeover.

[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:38.800]
That was the first bloodless coup.

[02:43:38.980 --> 02:43:42.000]
Was the takeover of the Republican party by the right wing fanatical elements

[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:43.300]
and they've got them all by the short hairs.

[02:43:43.580 --> 02:43:45.240]
Maybe they got naked pictures of all these guys.

[02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:47.340]
Is it possible?

[02:43:47.580 --> 02:43:47.980]
Uh-huh.

[02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:51.640]
So Joe Lockhart's up there holding the press conference in the White House

[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:52.540]
of the new press secretary.

[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:57.580]
And they said, is it, uh, is the truth that the president is saying in private things that

[02:43:57.580 --> 02:43:58.940]
is what he said.

[02:43:59.300 --> 02:44:00.200]
Well, did he say no?

[02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:00.740]
And they said no.

[02:44:01.820 --> 02:44:04.320]
They, and no, certainly he needs Hillary King to do the drop in.

[02:44:04.340 --> 02:44:04.500]
No.

[02:44:05.580 --> 02:44:06.500]
Here's a pompano.

[02:44:06.500 --> 02:44:06.700]
Hello.

[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:08.140]
Great show, Neil.

[02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:08.820]
Yes, it is.

[02:44:09.220 --> 02:44:11.240]
Your comments are just so right on.

[02:44:11.420 --> 02:44:13.660]
You are the true definition of a great American.

[02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:14.580]
Dale, good on.

[02:44:14.580 --> 02:44:17.800]
Hey, I was listening to NPR on the way in the work.

[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:18.640]
Oh, you're the one, yeah.

[02:44:18.720 --> 02:44:19.520]
Yeah, I'm the one, right?

[02:44:19.700 --> 02:44:24.580]
And a lot of folks, um, particularly men for some reason, not a lot, but a few are calling

[02:44:24.580 --> 02:44:27.080]
up and they're using this, well, what do we tell our children?

[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:27.780]
Excuse.

[02:44:28.380 --> 02:44:29.720]
Tell their children to mind their own business.

[02:44:29.940 --> 02:44:33.740]
These are the same people who tell their children that if they're not good all year round,

[02:44:33.900 --> 02:44:35.160]
Santa Claus ain't going to bring them nothing.

[02:44:35.340 --> 02:44:39.820]
Yeah, and stick the tooth under the pillow because the tooth fairy, the only good fairy is the tooth fairy, right?

[02:44:40.020 --> 02:44:43.720]
I mean, that's just, you know, these people, they lie to their children all the time.

[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:46.000]
And they want to know what to tell their children.

[02:44:46.220 --> 02:44:48.320]
All of a sudden, America is so uptight about lying.

[02:44:48.500 --> 02:44:49.900]
I mean, most people lie about their sexualized.

[02:44:49.900 --> 02:44:51.460]
Most people lie about a lot of things.

[02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:53.820]
And if it isn't something that harms anybody, who the hell cares?

[02:44:54.060 --> 02:44:54.760]
Or the secretary.

[02:44:55.060 --> 02:44:59.620]
Yeah, I mean, if he would have abused Monica Lewinsky, if he would have forced himself on her, that's one thing.

[02:44:59.940 --> 02:45:05.140]
If, uh, Apollo Jones indeed would have been denied a job or advancement because of a sexual harassment,

[02:45:05.140 --> 02:45:08.960]
which is totally bogus, all she did was not get flowers on secretary's day one day.

[02:45:09.140 --> 02:45:11.800]
But other than that, uh, so what are we talking about here?

[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:14.400]
Well, that's why I say your comments are so right on.

[02:45:14.500 --> 02:45:14.960]
Yes, they are.

[02:45:15.020 --> 02:45:20.400]
And one thing real quickly, um, Governor Grant, um, far former governor, now Senator Graham.

[02:45:20.600 --> 02:45:21.620]
Senator Bubblehead, yeah.

[02:45:21.760 --> 02:45:24.420]
He will be one of the few Democrats to vote for impeachment.

[02:45:24.620 --> 02:45:25.340]
You think so? I know.

[02:45:25.420 --> 02:45:27.580]
I know Senator Burr, that sanctimonious old part.

[02:45:27.700 --> 02:45:28.660]
I know he's going to vote for it.

[02:45:28.680 --> 02:45:29.900]
Here's the reason why I say that.

[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:35.460]
I sent him a letter and I got back from a form letter with him basically saying, you know,

[02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:41.500]
I'm going to vote to him, teach the guy and I couldn't understand why he's one of the few Democrats that is not.

[02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:42.660]
Supporting Clinton.

[02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:48.320]
Now remember back in 92 when Clinton ran for president, he had a vice presidential choice,

[02:45:48.500 --> 02:45:49.620]
narrowed down to two people.

[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:50.000]

[02:45:50.260 --> 02:45:51.100]
One was our goal.

[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:52.220]
Guess who the other one was.

[02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:53.200]
Bobby, give Graham right.

[02:45:53.660 --> 02:45:54.040]
Hey, back on.

[02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:55.760]
And he sure some made the right choice.

[02:45:55.960 --> 02:45:56.380]
I'll tell you that.

[02:45:56.420 --> 02:45:58.880]
Yeah, well now Graham's going to pay him back for that little choice.

[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:00.740]
You want even be a contest?

[02:46:00.980 --> 02:46:01.780]
I'm telling you right now.

[02:46:01.900 --> 02:46:02.800]
Oh, don't even be close.

[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:03.840]
No, it won't.

[02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:04.720]
They need two thirds.

[02:46:04.860 --> 02:46:06.000]
They need 67 votes.

[02:46:06.140 --> 02:46:08.840]
They haven't got a Chinaman's chance in hell getting 67 votes.

[02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:11.840]
And I don't care what, what's his name from Kenenjo Lieberman says.

[02:46:12.100 --> 02:46:13.480]
They haven't got any chance of getting that.

[02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:19.860]
Well, I think the guy from Princeton who addressed the committee hit the com hit a hit the nail on the head when he said the Henry hide.

[02:46:20.380 --> 02:46:21.780]
History will hunt you down.

[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:22.500]
Right, exactly.

[02:46:22.780 --> 02:46:23.320]
I'm a great thing.

[02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:23.960]
And back to you.

[02:46:24.380 --> 02:46:25.500]
History will hunt him down.

[02:46:25.660 --> 02:46:27.540]
And the guy in Weston's going to hunt him down too.

[02:46:27.660 --> 02:46:29.040]
The one at whose marriage that he broke up.

[02:46:30.140 --> 02:46:30.500]
Yes.

[02:46:31.340 --> 02:46:32.700]
863 and dead are the new door.

[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:34.180]
Oh, there's that door now.

[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:34.540]
Sorry.

[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:35.880]
Older than a door nail.

[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:38.340]
Okay, 860, three bucks per cent of one today.

[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:40.020]
And they're still over there in the corner University of Brock.

[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:43.800]
We need another 137 bucks in the next 12 minutes to get to 1000.

[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:44.840]
We're going to do that to the end.

[02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:48.460]
Oh, but in the meantime, the 863 puts us over the $98,000 mark.

[02:46:49.460 --> 02:46:52.500]
So tomorrow on this show, I have a feeling very strongly.

[02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:55.980]
If we can crawl our way along here today and get a couple of other more over there today.

[02:46:56.620 --> 02:47:01.840]
I got a feeling tomorrow that no matter where we go, for sure, we're going to go over 100,000 right on the end of the show tomorrow.

[02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:02.880]
There you go.

[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:07.380]
Show those goddamn right wingers and that asshole buddy Nevin's a finger too.

[02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:10.360]
That we can raise some serious money right here on the show for a worthwhile cause.

[02:47:11.500 --> 02:47:15.780]
And we don't need to have no statues or monuments or anybody kiss our ass and exchange for it.

[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:16.840]
Like Wayne Hypinga.

[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:18.100]
He's an asshole.

[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:19.540]
Here's Miami.

[02:47:19.580 --> 02:47:19.900]
Hello.

[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:20.840]
Oh, Wayne Hypinga.

[02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:22.860]
Yes, sir.

[02:47:23.700 --> 02:47:24.380]
Speak to me.

[02:47:24.860 --> 02:47:25.500]
Are you speaking?

[02:47:25.800 --> 02:47:26.280]
Oh, that's it.

[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:26.860]
That was his thing.

[02:47:26.960 --> 02:47:27.480]
Wayne Hypinga.

[02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:29.480]
Oh, that was Wayne Hypinga.

[02:47:29.620 --> 02:47:30.640]
Here's a lady in Hollywood.

[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:31.000]
Hello.

[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:31.620]
Hi.

[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:32.380]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:33.140]
How are you?

[02:47:33.340 --> 02:47:33.500]
Great.

[02:47:34.020 --> 02:47:34.800]
I'm so great.

[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:37.800]
You were speaking out for this event, you know.

[02:47:37.980 --> 02:47:38.660]
Thank God for me.

[02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:39.100]
That's right.

[02:47:39.700 --> 02:47:42.220]
I'm the voice of reason and sanity and it's otherwise an exception.

[02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:44.440]
I'm so upset when I watch the television.

[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:45.580]
Can you believe it?

[02:47:45.700 --> 02:47:46.600]
Can you believe this craft?

[02:47:46.940 --> 02:47:47.760]
I couldn't believe it.

[02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:55.440]
And you say, when Henry Hypinga was doing a fair conduction about hearing, he won't even let people answer.

[02:47:56.060 --> 02:48:07.060]
You know, when they ask all these people who have been sent a question and he won't even allow them to answer.

[02:48:07.220 --> 02:48:07.640]
Oh, that's okay.

[02:48:07.760 --> 02:48:08.700]
Only the Republican.

[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:09.140]
Yeah.

[02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:14.800]
And who was Henry Hypinga to Jack saying, you know, Clinton is right.

[02:48:14.800 --> 02:48:17.040]
He's a big fan, hypocrite, is doing every odd thing.

[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:17.320]
I'm right.

[02:48:17.420 --> 02:48:20.660]
He's a big fan, a big hypocrite, that lied to the woman said he wasn't married.

[02:48:20.860 --> 02:48:23.980]
So he messed up his own god, they married, screwed up this other poor guy's marriage.

[02:48:23.980 --> 02:48:25.340]
And he's a phony below him.

[02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:27.760]
And then lied about that by saying he was just a young guy.

[02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:30.440]
So he was, oh, he was 41 years old, which ain't no young teenager.

[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:30.700]
Right.

[02:48:30.820 --> 02:48:33.860]
He was a 41-year-old full adult who knew damn well what he was doing.

[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.360]
He's a goddamn liar and a hypocrite in the phony.

[02:48:36.500 --> 02:48:41.420]
And he's sitting up there, passing judgment and also lying and passing himself off as this great diplomat.

[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:42.140]
Like, yeah, right.

[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:44.180]
There's no partisan politics involved.

[02:48:44.300 --> 02:48:46.240]
How are you, kiddin' you, Nazi bastard?

[02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:48.920]
Anyway.

[02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:51.980]
Well, hey, listen, you got to get out of your system because...

[02:48:52.100 --> 02:48:54.520]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:57.280]
10-4-2 at 5-60-WQ-S.

[02:48:57.380 --> 02:48:57.540]
Yeah.

[02:48:57.780 --> 02:49:00.080]
Oh, thank god for that.

[02:49:00.460 --> 02:49:02.880]
By the way, tell Joel that might be from the silence of the land.

[02:49:03.740 --> 02:49:04.820]
I'll never get over that.

[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:06.800]
I'm not sure which has got me more distraught.

[02:49:06.860 --> 02:49:09.020]
Not knowing that that asshole is Andy at the hockey games.

[02:49:09.300 --> 02:49:10.360]
Or did that Joel called?

[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:15.500]
Dr. Frank Einstein to tell us to announce to us, oh, it's Joel.

[02:49:15.740 --> 02:49:19.520]
I'm telling you, man, just a couple of weeks in Tampa will fry your brain and your living proof.
