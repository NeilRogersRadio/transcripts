[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.820]
Well, Levin is now able to keep the ball away from him pretty consistently tonight.

[00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.580]
He has made some real good pitches.

[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.140]
And the ball is here high and deep as ever.

[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.740]
Youngwood is fading, looking up.

[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.880]
Heck Wilson, move over.

[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.540]
You have been tied.

[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.780]
Mark LeWire with number 56, all and he has tied the National League record.

[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.200]
And now going berserk and pro-bear stadium.

[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.780]
Look at this crowd.

[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.860]
Oh, right.

[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.000]
So he and Heck Wilson are lying side by side.

[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.180]
And it's tied for the record in the National League, home-monger in a single season.

[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.540]
His next will break it.

[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.720]
And now he's hit the deep center.

[00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.680]
He did it.

[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.420]
He did it.

[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.520]
He did it.

[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.320]
Number 57.

[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.760]
Unbelievable.

[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.180]
Oh, my.

[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.960]
And they are going crazy in South Florida.

[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.100]
Barry White's back with his new R&B chartbuster.

[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.140]
Love putting.

[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.000]
You like a donut with no one.

[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.540]
Every in the middle.

[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.560]
Ask me if you were them home.

[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.040]
The master of sensuality that turns to the sea that was more loved than any one person can hand them a doll in.

[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.920]
Can't get enough.

[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.780]
Play those synabels if you love playing.

[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.120]
Also, the dream is new number one now.

[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.740]
The Apolloting Lost of Hologin Oliver.

[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.420]
You followed an ice cream.

[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:55.660]
How beautiful it is that he somebody get me a four good spary white love pudding available now in the frozen food section of your local grocer.

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.220]
They're thinking about putting me back on in Fort Myers.

[00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.240]
Let's hear about that Greg.

[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.220]
Oh, we're looking at Greg brought down Georgia's bonus check today.

[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.740]
Not.

[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.540]
They had a good spring rating book over there.

[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.740]
And I think it's because of me they're about to tell David Kate in the AFA to stick it where the moon don't shine.

[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.020]
And put it back on her maybe over in Fort Myers.

[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.420]
So there's really good news and even better news is in spite of Sam the scam.

[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.420]
We got our masters already thanks to our friend at track master for the best of CDs this year.

[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.500]
Boy, that was the fast look at that.

[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.160]
Georgia's got him right in this push right now.

[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.480]
That's the fastest section.

[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.300]
We just did that like a few days ago.

[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.880]
We put that all together and like almost overnight.

[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.740]
Thank you Sam.

[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.080]
We couldn't have done it without you sweetheart.

[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.400]
Thanks Greg for the good news.

[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.960]
See nothing but good news today.

[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.940]
Markets up a few points up 300 points yesterday.

[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.520]
Everybody's in a good mood today.

[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.580]
Mark McGuire hits two big ones last night.

[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.680]
Those two little kids didn't want to hold about your money.

[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.820]
What the hell's wrong with life?

[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.420]
Here's Pembroke Pines with 10 questions marks.

[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.700]
Hello.

[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.320]
Back by popular man.

[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.800]
Yes.

[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.100]
Yeah.

[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.220]
Oh gone by popular.

[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.080]
Maybe you didn't have a chance to say a nice going George.

[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.540]
That was any but he never had a chance to say it.

[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.760]
Back by popular demand.

[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.720]
George said it sounded like some drug and do stasel on there.

[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.500]
And I said you know what?

[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.320]
He's an asshole.

[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.140]
And I was right.

[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.840]
We have an open line in Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60 and power 5 60 in a mobile one line.

[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.460]
Thank you Eddie.

[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.080]
Here's a western hello.

[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.420]
Nail.

[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.920]
Yes sir.

[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.880]
How are you doing buddy?

[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.040]
I'm doing okay palie.

[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.580]
Hey I'll tell you what.

[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.040]
Don't trust anybody who says palie.

[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.080]
Hey palie.

[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.840]
I know you don't like that.

[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.520]
I'll tell you what.

[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.180]
I'll tell you what.

[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.620]
That was it had chills running down my spine.

[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.140]
I'll tell you what the crowd was going absolutely berserk.

[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.220]
They've shot.

[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:44.360]
I mean it was like last year when they were beating San Francisco Atlanta and had that

[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.540]
type of feeling to it.

[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.940]
Yeah 37,000 tickets they sold for last night.

[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.400]
I'm not sure they all showed up but nevertheless.

[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.080]
Can you imagine how many people would have been there the last two nights without Mark McGuire?

[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.720]
Exactly.

[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.240]
And tonight they that place ought to be jammed to the rafters because who knows who

[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.720]
is what he's going to do tonight and we're not going to be able to see it.

[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.140]
Oh by the way they are showing brave menace against Randy Johnson due to

[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.880]
them I think.

[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.140]
I think that's the matter.

[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.040]
I agree with you.

[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.540]
I agree with you.

[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.320]
I agree with you.

[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.880]
Oh well 1000% much rather the history they made.

[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.440]
I mean the brave Houston games got no significance.

[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.220]
I mean Houston's got the division wrapped up.

[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.080]
The Braves got there's long since wrapped up.

[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.120]
I mean you know two great pictures there but what's the comparison between that and the

[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.540]
guy who's broken the national league record who any day now is approaching 60 and 61 and

[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.700]
62 and 65.

[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.180]
I think he's going to do 65.

[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.120]
Absolutely correct sir.

[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.320]
Right.

[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.200]
Just to let you know I just saw the back door boys on a rig.

[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.940]
I missed that.

[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.500]
Ron was telling me that it was on it.

[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.500]
I think I was something.

[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.960]
They're ugly.

[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.380]
No.

[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.400]
Besides I don't know about them being ugly.

[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.180]
Now they're good guys.

[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.180]
They are talented.

[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.820]
They're great.

[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.820]
They are.

[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.320]
I mean these guys can sing.

[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.600]
They walk up to the microphone.

[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.880]
Yeah.

[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.860]
No music.

[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.360]
Right.

[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.700]
No instruments.

[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.520]
I mean nothing.

[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.200]
Well even those people who rip them other than George admit that they can sing that they're

[00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.640]
great singers.

[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.860]
So what can I tell you?

[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.460]
I can't tell you what.

[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.900]
What are you laughing about?

[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.580]
There they are.

[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.020]
They're a very talented guy.

[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.360]
See he's in there.

[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.120]
They hope he has equal time.

[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.400]
Monday.

[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.900]
Have a great day.

[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.880]
I love you.

[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.480]
Love you.

[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.680]
Well yeah.

[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.820]
Monday you can rip the backstreet boys for four hours.

[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.140]
Okay.

[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.480]
I have a young girl.

[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.240]
Everyone has ears.

[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.600]
Everyone has ears.

[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.780]
So that's why that album has been on her for longer than any other album than the top 15.

[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.040]
Any other one in the world.

[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.220]
All those teeny boppy little girls.

[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.420]
Yeah.

[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.880]
All those teeny boppy little girls.

[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.200]
You know something you only wish.

[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.620]
You knew those teeny boppy little girls.

[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.980]
Okay.

[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.400]
You better start liking the backstreet boys a lot more.

[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.040]
Mr.

[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.360]
Why your wife's out of town?

[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.880]
Here is Miami.

[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.260]
Hello.

[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.060]
Miami.

[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.120]
Hello, Neil.

[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.780]
Yes sir.

[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.580]
What?

[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.540]
What kind of a phone?

[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.960]
What kind of a phone is that sir?

[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.960]
I know it's a mess up.

[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.180]
It's my first time phone.

[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.680]
I like to show it not on my computer.

[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.940]
You know?

[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.300]
I'm going to a Solomon had a better phone than that.

[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.260]
I'll be with you.

[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.560]
You can see that this guy's having a new phone.

[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.800]
Okay.

[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.580]
This guy, he's going to our guy's sock over it.

[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.660]
And what over the phone too?

[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.060]
Anybody ever put an our guy's sock over it?

[00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.440]
Uh-huh.

[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.840]
We have an open line and dating you.

[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.580]
That means he said.

[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.160]
Okay.

[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.600]
There you go.

[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.920]
We got a guy that's got a bunch of y'all.

[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.840]
You know, I was thinking I was watching the shows which were great on Wami last night.

[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.060]
By the way, if I say so myself.

[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.800]
Man, was I busy with that TV?

[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.020]
I was clicking it in the ankyent and twisting it and the remote too.

[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.640]
I'm watching the best of a shlameel on there on Wami.

[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.080]
I'm watching Mark McGuire.

[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.420]
I'm watching David Wells.

[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.940]
That big fat David Wells.

[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.700]
I'm watching Sammy Sosa who kept striking out and smiling about it.

[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.720]
And hey, he's doing a best he can.

[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.040]
Okay.

[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.740]
He's a Dominican Republic guy.

[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.560]
What does he want?

[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.500]
And those shows were pretty damn good last night.

[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.660]
Too bad we can't find an audience.

[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.720]
But talking about good news, we finally got the magic bullet, baby.

[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.840]
The magic bullet on Wami.

[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.000]
And that is that as soon as the public out there discovers that mash is on 200 times tonight,

[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.440]
it might just draw some people to that station.

[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.440]
See, during those cartoons in like on a weekend, they've already got the kids.

[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.100]
The kids are like way ahead of the adults.

[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.560]
The kids are locked in on Wami.

[00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.000]
They're like whamming it all day long.

[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.540]
With those cartoons in the middle three studios crap and the monsters.

[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.300]
But in prime time at night, we can't find an audience with a goddamn search party no matter what we put on there.

[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:16.020]
But now that we got mash on 6.30, 7.30, 11 o'clock, 11.30, you don't mean magic is gone, do you?

[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.000]

[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.300]
little arrows long as it's popping up that's only care about any year old to

[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.440]
here's my any hello

[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.100]
hello new yes or

[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.220]
uh... you know what's calling because i believe it was yesterday the day before

[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.660]
i'm not exactly sure uh... some gentleman called in

[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.620]
you were saying how he was like a woman called on the show

[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.200]
yeah farfetched

[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.680]
you were saying how he was like uh... broadcasting major

[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.500]
and you know right off the bat you were telling him don't do it but

[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.880]
and you know i've heard of the kind of hard time

[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.260]
on that profession but i want to know what the school

[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:33.520]
because

[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.880]
you know what's the scoop with what

[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.640]
what do you think about

[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.560]
the business

[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.520]
what in like the aesthetic of the people in general or uh... because it's run by

[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.240]
people have no idea what it's all about

[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.900]
because uh... it's a grand and now it's even worse than ever with a handful

[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.960]
of companies that bought up all the station and they don't give a crap and

[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.940]
they never used to care about people too much but now they care less about

[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.360]
people and people get toppled on and stepped on and they just keep

[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.040]
changing formats and blowing everybody out the door in five minutes

[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.840]
uh... if this were a while business run by people who are real broadcasters

[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.800]
then it could be a lot of fun and would be a great business you courage people

[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.520]
to get into it

[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.460]
but i can't do that with a clear conscience

[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.360]
what would you say to like people that are

[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.840]
kind of starting to edge their way in that path and you know i'd say edge my way

[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.700]
out of the path

[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.940]
i mean you know people with the kids i'd say edge my way in anything else

[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.880]

[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.740]

swooning and jumping off tall building i don't care that i used to be a big football fan but quite

[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:55.080]
frankly it's become boring it's become boring is all hell the number of really exciting good

[00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:00.880]
games that you see in the course of a season is so few that it's uh it's a snoozer now it's

[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:06.700]
snooze time so i'll stick with my hockey and i you know these experts can come out all the tv

[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:11.060]
ratings are terrible and it's a uh i don't care that's my thing that's my bag

[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.820]
we have an open line and day one and brown at five six seven and usually the people are

[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:21.700]

[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.700]
mcclain because he wants nine or ten million dollars a year that's the problem that's uh that's

[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.660]
why he ain't down here because uh he wants out of there badly out of Vancouver you didn't see

[00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.900]
anybody talking here seriously about getting pavel burray or peter netbed who still float around

i would love him to come here and these guys here just given a shallot of double talk is what we get

[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:15.180]
that amount of material you like to wash pal okay date counties open against you i mentioned

[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:19.240]
hockey date county as bad as it is ordinarily that's something that they really don't understand

[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.340]
they don't get it they're they're more into like dominoe games and cock fights five six seven

[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.880]
oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one one you gotta learn new things you gotta

[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:34.440]
expand your horizons okay you put parochial narrow focused people in date county you gotta like

[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.500]
move out onward enough word in a new and different things i mean anal sex we heard all about that

[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.600]
okay you educated us that's fine but now you gotta move on to things that are a little bit more

[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.180]
whatever i was gonna say stimulating but that might not be the right choice of words

[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:56.400]
here's a mobile in margate hello deal yes sir how you doing i'm doing great you know i uh i was talking

[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.620]
to some people yesterday about this i heard something about kid turners start his own uh football

[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.020]
that's right just what we need is another guy damn football league that's gonna run so we can

[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:10.400]
have football all year long for these football addicts but it have like how's that gonna go i mean

[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:17.260]
is that on in the works or uh do you remember the world league of football yeah yeah so they're

[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:24.080]
gonna what they're gonna do the only time the only time in history that the old uh w h all the

[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.780]
world hockey league which was eventually a one-fost and some of it was absorbed by the national

[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:32.320]
hockey league some of the franchises and the old american football league which then became the

[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.600]
american football conference when emerged with the NFL uh that's the best that they can hope for

[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:42.620]
i mean how much uh money is there out there to subsidize this crap how much talent is there

[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.540]
out there to build a whole bunch more teams when you've already got a bunch of horrendous teams i

[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.460]
hear put out talking about the eagles and the bears and all these other teams the the rams that

[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.960]
are just gonna be horrendous nauseating teams this year how are you gonna build new teams what

[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:00.980]
where's the talent gonna come from but i think that the uh the world is so boring and that the

[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:06.140]
people will just go to it because sports i i don't agree i don't think so i think you're wrong

[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.600]
okay i got another thing because i mean unless it's real low priced unless you're practically

[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:15.400]
given a ticket to weigh and uh who the hell's gonna play league out there look out look how they're

[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.880]
priced in the uh the price of me out i can't afford it right i'm not a poor guy but i can't afford

[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.580]
to take uh my family and who the hell can who can football game okay another thing i'm watching

[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:32.680]
your show on on tv i really love it by the way but what great deal with the yamaka it's uh a

[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.380]
messenger protest it's to try to show those little kids out there how stupid they look when

[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.280]
their parents force him to walk around with a beanie on her i'm watching it with my buddies and

[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.980]
we're like just i were like what the hell's it deal with the yamaka but another thing i think that

[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:52.920]
this uh mark mcwire thing is conspiracy because i know there's vapor who's saved baseball when

[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:59.160]
during the white stock scandal but i think this is just the scandal and i think that the you think

[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:04.440]
maybe it maybe the throw them a ball on a string i'm not on a string but i think this is yeah i

[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:09.100]
really i'm i believe it can be your see theory maybe they have maybe they have a lot of balls

[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.820]
hidden inside the inside those baseballs actually well well niel look how look how long he's been

[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:20.020]
around and he hasn't you know come this close yet oh migrarian he had 58 last year i know i know he

[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:25.120]
did over 53 years in a row which nobody has ever done have a great day pal never came close before

[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.700]
58 sounds pretty close to 60 and 61 to me doesn't it uh sounds pretty close

[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.980]
but this guy i will put donny b on the case okay he'll go out there and uh

[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.100]
i hope probably catch one of those balls in a condom and we'll check it out we'll open it we'll

[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:46.120]
slice it open right here on a year and the ball too 10 57 we got mark migwara 56 and 57 the

[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:50.620]
all-time nationally record breaking a record that stood by hack wilson of the cubs 68 years does

[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:55.380]
anybody here care no she's this man i thought it was pretty damn compelling myself for me to put

[00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:00.840]
that stuff on tape last night and bring that in here we're not talking hockey highlights we're talking

[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.320]
baseball highlights they want to define us man to keep the ball away okay good

[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:12.600]
and i say three minutes before eleven to five sixty qa they don't care i want to tell you

[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.880]
something you want to make a lot of money anybody out there if you can figure out besides free

[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:22.560]

you just knocked it off the air

[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.940]

the doncotts really weighs about six fifty they had to get a meat scale

[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.360]
they had to drop in from a hook onto a meat scale to see just how much he's

[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.300]
tilting the scales these days that's why he don't come around here that fat's long

eighteen t line do we have any confirmation on the thing about the panther tickets

[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.700]
because the panther tickets wouldn't be coming out in just a couple of days the season

[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.580]

[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.340]
start to uh... september the uh... not that far off

[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.340]
september the uh... yeah far off twenty seven so they wouldn't be sending those tickets out

[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.620]
yet it's always like a couple days ahead of time

[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.100]
should i be uh... panicking about this uh...

[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:50.940]
so when i'm getting back to fat people at the phase now i'm one of those people yes i'm fat

[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.260]
but during the course of my life i have never been a uh...

[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.500]
a big befader we just have a great place in the twerk cult skipper stable out in lafonia

[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.480]
when he used to go to the track all men was at a great place i mean outstanding but that's

[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.260]
like a hundred years ago but i'm just not a winner of a fake kind of guy till i found the

[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.740]
m.l.co which happens to be sensational spectacular so we go in there for dinner on sunday

[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:15.460]
and i'm going to tell you i said i'm in there with two my friends i said we are even with me in the

[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:21.420]
group we are the skinniest table in the entire place now the m.l.co is so good believe me i hope

[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:25.080]
that people are skinny go in there because you can afford to eat a lot of food you don't have

[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:30.660]
to worry about killing yourself but any buffet you go to you will see people uh... you know what i'm

[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:35.680]
talking about have you ever been in one of these joints who are enormous and all around i'm

[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:41.420]
looking up to get got all my i feel like uh... skinny mini i have never seen so many gigantic

[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:47.480]
enormous puppets in my life these are people who are like al gold steam level that's how fat they

[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.260]
were everywhere in fact the waiters are like start in the background you hear them

[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:55.500]
like sniggering a little bit is not the word i'm looking for sniggering

[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:59.700]
that these enormous blobs of humanity that are waddling around

[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:04.300]
and i guess they figure might as well enjoy the food is good any meal could be the last one but

[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.480]
as well go out with a big smile on your post before they open up that piano case

[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.700]
i mean i'm not talking about isolated one or two i'm talking about

[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.840]
dozens because they're always mad that you're a whole lot of people in there and i'd say like

[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:21.780]
maybe fifty sixty percent or more maybe seventy percent of the people in these buffet places are

[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.000]
enormous gigantic like this eight hundred pound woman i was in vanskin robins last night

[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.880]
and inquiring about how much sugar there was in her fifteen scoops of ice cream and how much sugar

[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:38.040]
there was like twenty pounds of uh... with topping that they put on top and the cherries and the nuts

[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.200]
here's uh... in fact i went in there there was this uh... young guy way behind the counter and i said

[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:50.580]
hold the nuts here's north mommy beach hello and he did hello hello yes sir oh okay i didn't hear

[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:56.480]
you say north mommy well i'm a little slow excuse me excuse me but back to my my why i was watching

[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:11.180]
that last night yeah and i'm i just got the the replays and it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's

[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:15.680]
pop up oh yeah oh yeah two seconds i mean there's not even any excitement to be honest with it

[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.260]
because from a minute they show him a swing in a bet till the time it hits on that tarp and center

[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:24.840]
feel it's like i feel like a rocket shot like so you launched it yeah i don't watch bait fall

[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.040]
very much but this of course is magnificent you know i'm i'm watching this guy's fat speed and

[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:34.160]
the strength i'm sitting there with my jaw hanging down you know it's amazing and uh i got a

[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.360]
couple other things if you still want to talk to me go ahead i'm listening uh what what i like

[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:42.520]
i like the way you said that in other words if you haven't poured us yet go you know i don't know

[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:46.020]
what's going on everything is relative i mean compared to many of these people you're i

[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:50.060]
about a five on a skillet 200 you're okay okay well that doesn't matter you're not me talk so

[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:56.000]
here i go go ahead um this what happens to uh x's and o's on for shows that happen about talking

[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.280]
to the game you know you turn into a sports show anywhere you listen and it's oh this guy's good

[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:06.140]
this guy's not good and his salary and this and that i'm thinking what about the linebacker what's

[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.740]
the linebacker doing this situation what about the point yeah it's ridiculous either better they're

[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:14.800]
talking about the uh the points bread you know i'm gonna get it fucking gambling talk we gotta have

[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.220]
a separate show for a couple hours if you'd have been saying this for months just call it gambling

[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.600]
talk get all the degenerate gamblers on it and have like real sports shows where people talk real

[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:26.740]
sports the only problem is in this time where you find people to talk real sports because most of

[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:31.900]
them don't know what they're talking about have a great day pal okay it's you so when you're speaking

[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:36.200]
of that speaking of assholes on the internet and god are there millions and millions there's no

[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:43.060]
shortage of assholes on the internet all over the world study says internet addicts often show other

[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:50.520]
disorders disorders oh my god yeah what a shock to us you know i i will never ever i said this

[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.860]
many weeks ago and i have not even been inspired or thought never look at that chat room again on

[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.920]
a website it's a shame too because Julio Benito did a tremendous job put together our neogod.com

[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:05.140]
website it's great but when you go into channel and what was i expecting i don't know because i've

[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:09.000]
always said that every chat room i've ever looked at has been uh just a bunch of babbling idiots

[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.120]
and ours is certainly no exception of course it's no longer ours anyways they had emperors

[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:19.620]
their chat room so why the hell should we look at it and i don't but this is pretty damn interesting

[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:24.900]
it says people who seem addicted to the internet often show a bumper crop of psychiatric disorders

[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:30.860]
like manic depression and treating those other conditions might help them rain in their urge to be

[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:38.020]
online on average internet addicts in the study report on average report and having five

[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:43.040]
psychiatric disorders at some point in their lives of finding that just blew me away since

[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:49.260]
archiatrist Nathan Shapiro of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine it's unclear whether

[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:53.300]
the internet problem should be considered disorder itself or just a symptom of something else

[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:59.480]
or whether certain disorders promote excessive online use he scheduled to present the study

[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.120]
Monday meaning uh yes there are two days ago at the annual meeting of the APA in Toronto

[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:09.200]

[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.960]
method like a dog sled or something like that because air Canada is on strike sorry hailing won't

[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:35.040]

[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:40.780]

[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:44.540]
stuff on the internet it's it's a lot of fun if there's certain things you're looking for you

[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:48.040]
want to look up old newspaper articles you want to read the history you want to get the

[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:53.160]
there's just tons of good stuff on it but there's also millions and millions and millions of

[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:58.560]
misfits and sickos and wackos and there's the living proof right there and average of five

[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:05.400]

all the crap that's going on the world if there is such a thing as a god which is ridiculous

[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:38.380]
on the face of it but if there were that he's got time to worry about athletes and ball games

[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:44.320]

and you see here's what he's terrified if that happens not only will it sour that deal but it'll

[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:07.140]
sour any other prospective deal they have with anybody else that for trade need a mark which you

[00:50:54.560 --> 00:51:00.060]
getting a little overhand preventative there with that male situation see the male i hate to

[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:04.180]
break the news to letter carriers out there but it's the way that people are communicated each other

[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:08.520]
like if there are bills or checks or stuff like that purely important in people's lines

[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:12.980]
that you people are giving a song and then well you know if you got anything within 10 to 14

net sack to my big dogs ass and he could schlep the male on a guarantee is a lot smarter than most

[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:33.040]

[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:11.520]
oh i'm sorry here's uh Miami Lake hello hello yes sir hey Neil how you doing okay uh first i'd say

[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:16.460]
uh thank you for uh well let me see how can i put it how can you put it

[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:23.320]
when i started listening to you yeah i was going through some doubts in the in the christian

[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:30.000]
religion and and um and i was brainwashed and in the church yeah and i was brainwashed and to

[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.400]
believing that uh you know the laddy laddy whatever laddy laddy laddy you said it very well sir

[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:39.520]
okay perfect so when you got so um you know when i started having those doubts everybody thought

[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.300]
i was going crazy because i was very very very much into the religion and i used to go

[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:50.200]
preaching to my friends and everybody when i was like i say starting in 18 i started realizing

[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:57.780]
on my own that uh it wasn't making any sense oh my god the more i learned about it the more i

[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:04.560]
got turned off and the more i realized the contradiction within the bible and uh what did look at

[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:09.180]
the very first pager read that day about the uh the sun and the stars and the the he he made the

[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:14.220]
sun to all the day and the and then the moon to rule the night and then he made the stars also

[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:18.420]
which of course we know rather the sun is just the star but the first people that wrote that crap

[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:22.380]
had no idea about that all he knew is that there were two lights up there today and so he made the

[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:26.720]
sun for the day time and the moon for the right time as if they just show up there at the

[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:32.840]
particular times yeah oh god and he's also funny that they they were saying that the earth was

[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:39.220]
clapped 500 years ago yeah when the the older civilizations like uh the Egyptians and the Maya they

[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:43.200]
knew that yeah they knew all the planets were like well you're going to get the pop-all upset again

[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:47.640]
it took them 500 years to apologize to Galileo now he's going to have to start apologizing to them too

[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:53.480]
i mean that's ridiculous and another thing uh changing the subject uh George uh he said something

[00:53:53.480 --> 00:54:02.200]
about the Jews beyond camels yeah i saw the shoulder the other night on uh channel 60 i don't want to say

[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:10.980]
and uh and uh tell them not to forget uh the moors they were all uh spain for

[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:16.080]
i don't have more than the families sir uh you know Arabs in my fact he does he's got a bunch of

[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:20.820]
in fact you know something he until the tv people started coming in here he used to wear a turban

[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:25.680]
to work every day oh really like one day i think he followed David Neil's on a choco that's right

[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:29.580]
he used to come in here on his ass so he he's my diaper right then he probably knows that

[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:36.300]
make fun of that i'm sorry when he probably know that when we say oh ha la we're we're saying uh no you say

[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:40.820]
oh ha la boy you don't say oh ha la no i don't he pitches for the marlins oh hey hey hey hey

I was in high school and we used to have those assemblies and of course this isn't candidate

[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:44.320]
when the Yorker or there may be like ten Jewish families but nevertheless if the assembly

[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:49.760]
if we had the Lord's prayer oh yes in Jesus name but it'd be putable yeah right

[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.280]
and I used to say Jesus are we doing this again

[00:58:56.460 --> 00:59:03.060]

[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:51.120]
right over the overpass with his radar gun on and just down the road there are four other Broward

[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:36.100]
aspects that convinced me beyond a shadow but now I waste your time but God almighty watching a

[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:40.000]
bunch of adults I'm not talking about little kids who feel that they're compelled to you know

[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.600]
do whatever to hell everybody else tells them to do but watching a bunch of adults who are like

[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:51.340]
Jews and atheists and Christians scientists and whatever they are just standing up dutifully

[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:55.880]
going through some religious exercise by somebody who has just like a when the rabbi is out there

[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:59.660]
and here these Christians go out standing up because some rabbi is talking about at least he's not

[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:04.920]
doing it in the Hebrew anyway because except for the very orthodox the Jews tend to be somewhat

[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:09.600]
less intolerant than the very orthodox of the goyam although the very orthodox of both of them are

[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.740]
crazier in a bed bug you know what I'm talking about yeah I think you do

[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:20.300]
oh and then speaking I'm just out of control I saw a thing a rabbi who I had in my show years ago

[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:24.540]
I can't remember which one they all look the same they all look real Jewish it was on public

[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:30.260]
television and he was demonstrating he was laying to fill in he was demonstrating the very

[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:34.500]
thing that your accountant David the crazy Jew did to you that day where they wrapped these

[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:39.140]
straps around your arm and they put that crazy thing on a forehead and they like cut off the

[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:45.380]
circulation I am going to tell you something my friends there are crazy people walking around on

[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:52.200]
the loose you know the president got into trouble for laying monica these people are laying to fill

[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:59.700]
them at least laying monica may or may not have you know been a fun time come on it's kind of

[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:07.280]
sexual it's an sexual it's not an estinem thing it's a m thing pure unadulterated massacres

[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:14.860]
them the s part stands for stupidity laying to fill in there I wish that everybody in the world

[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:20.160]
could see this because I'm one Jew that's going to be honest enough to tell you that the crazy

[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.500]
Arabs are no crazier than the crazy fanatical Jews they deserve each other they that's a

[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:29.500]
Max made in heaven and they're all circumcised too by the way you're just out of a throat

[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:36.460]
in there for it well I'm on a roll barberry oh god he's tiny straps around it and his arm like

[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:41.900]
here on that day I was getting panicky you know your arm was purple all right with him I own yeah

[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:48.380]
right believe me for something else I wouldn't have been looking I mean you ever squeeze anything

[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:54.400]
so tight that it turned purple well that's beside not that God almighty they're doing this and

[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.660]
they've got that thing on their forehead and they wear in all these 40 pounds of clothing

[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:05.320]
and they expect people to go out to ball games and pay 50 and a hundred bucks to go to see

you TV people I just want to give you a little piece of advice okay since I saved your asses and

[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:19.140]
your jobs for like the next three months doing a show with those Israeli skinheads or whatever they

[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:26.420]
are Don Cox is not somebody we need on this program Don Cox is definitely not somebody I need

[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:31.940]
or want in this studio at any time of my life so if there are people out there encouraging him

[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:36.620]
because they're trying to orchestrate what they consider to be exciting events on a show go out

[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:40.860]
there and tape some exciting event go to the beach and tape some nude hot looking people out there

[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:44.720]

they're like uh like little obedient soldiers like an auntie's war yeah they're they're just

[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:37.620]
all right you're too better with so long ago though you know we didn't last very long because they

[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:41.240]
never gave us a box or anything we had to fill like a paper form we had to fill out and send

[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:47.320]
in the mail yeah and they sent you like a bunch of quarters or something for yeah that was good

[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:50.760]
to have a bunch of quarters well for some people it might be their full income but uh

[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:55.420]

[01:21:55.420 --> 01:22:00.860]
everything we'll show uh and the form to right and uh so you know we just never bother doing it but

[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:05.500]

[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:10.740]
rating system uh how unbiased could it possibly be if you're a family who has the box aren't you

[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:15.640]
gonna you know not watch certain shows because you don't want them to think that you're the kind

[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:19.740]
of family that watches oh absolutely you're that person about it right and especially you don't

[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:23.440]
want them to think that you're the kind of family that would watch you know someone crude like Neil

[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:28.060]
so i don't know i just i find yeah but if you are watching it you can't fool the box

[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:32.920]
that well yeah but if if you're not using the boxes for filling out the paper form or regardless

[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:40.020]
so it can't be a biased thing and uh anyway i also wanted to say thank you for uh the book he gave me

[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:44.660]
which was the uh what sucks about south Florida right it actually came in as a pretty handy reference

[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:48.540]
tool because i was moving from north Miami to coral spring and i wasn't all that familiar with coral

[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:52.520]
spring oh yeah they had a list all the gangs in there it was pretty good yeah for you know the

[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:56.780]
gang leaders their home phone numbers like that but oh just you know lists of phone numbers for

[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.540]
cable companies uh utility stuff like that it host office i wasn't expecting how to get your mail

[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:07.520]
forwarded real fast yeah anyway i think that's all i have to say for today have a good day now okay i

[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:12.640]
rebeaterchi okay we have an open line in date county five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty

[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:17.580]
i want to hear from somebody out there who's got the guts to sit through the invocation and see

[01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:21.680]
the problem with people is they're too worried about what other people will think of them okay

[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:28.740]
okay they're too god damn worried about what other people will think of them and quite frankly

[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:35.320]
i don't give a flying crap what anybody thinks which doesn't mean i go out of my way to offend people

[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.840]
but nevertheless i express my opinions the way i feel like it i dress the way i want to dress

[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:44.260]
like a slob and i do whatever the hell i want and if people don't like it give them the baffongula

[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:48.720]
baby i don't care what the hell do i give a crap about people that i don't even know a bunch of

[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:53.360]
strangers what they think about me at a football game if i'm outstanding for some bunch of barbaric

[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:58.820]
crap but all these other people oh we don't want to stick out in the crowd it's disrespectful it's

[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:02.600]
disrespectful for them to be doing the thing there in front of you that's what's this respectful

[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:08.200]
how about if you went if you're any god damn airport and you go in the tea room to take a leak

[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:12.560]
is there a priest in there you have to say a prayer in fact if there is a priest in there i'll tell

[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:18.040]
you one thing better run out run like hell that's right that priest been hanging out of that you're

[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:24.240]
in a hell of a long time i mean is that the appropriate place to be saying a god damn prayer no

[01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:31.860]
there's a time in a place for everything and at a god damn football game national football league

[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:38.300]
or otherwise is not the place for a religious exercise when the guys come out of the field for

[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:42.160]
practice before the game and they're doing their calisthenics and yankin and twisting it and

[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:47.180]
playing little grab ass with each other that's what the exercise is okay your exercise is getting off

[01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:51.780]
your ass going up and buying 20 or 30 more beers and a couple of overpriced weenies and burgers or

[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:57.480]
whatever that's the only exercise you're going to get there and you'll exercise your your jaws

[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:01.360]
and screaming and yelling there and hey guys you really suck how come how about scoring a touchdown

[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:05.740]
once in your lifetime you'll get that kind of exercise but religious exercise absolutely

[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:11.400]
positively wrong and you can't convince these people don't confuse us with the truth you stand out

[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:15.560]

[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:09.260]
else you know stand up and do it but i don't understand myself why they got to do that but i

[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:12.720]
guess a lot of people stand up because they're afraid like you said somebody standing around watching

[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.040]
them or god forbid something should happen during the game and they absolutely die

[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:19.600]
they get up there and god says how come he didn't stand up during the good point yeah

[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:02.400]

[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:06.320]
the games i'm going to start going back out there and stick about a bunch of invisible crazy glue

[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:11.340]

there and they're dressed it's a hundred degrees in the shade she's rifting from ethical yeah

[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:20.220]
and for what for nothing then they start the game and everybody's beating the brains out in the

[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:24.300]

we feel like standing up you're right you're full of crap you're spymless cowards you're a bunch of

[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:29.800]
pussies who just go along with a crowd just like they wanted about the Nazis and well you know we

[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:57.800]
Uranus here's a mobile and four-letter mail hello hey nail yes sir i'm one of those colors that

[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:03.140]
would stand up and say that everybody has a choice to do whatever they want to do so if those

[01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:09.600]
that true to stand up let them stand up don't but i mean you believe in what you believe in they

[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:14.300]
ought to have a chance to believe in what they believe so you let them say so you believe that all

[01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:17.640]
those people are just standing like when a priest is out there giving a very phenomenal

[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:21.940]
a dominoe a christian prayer you believe that all those people in there believe in what he's saying

[01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:27.260]
no no so what are they standing up so why should why are they standing up that's well they what

[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:32.600]
they are they stupid you know if you agree if you don't want to stand you have a

[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:37.080]
church to stand or not nobody's out holding the grunge you did that's what i keep telling them if

[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:41.140]
you want to sit on your ass or to any rest they don't have the grudges to do it but it's here you know

[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:46.660]
yeah they're a bunch of pussy's a lot of people don't have their own mind they they they a lot of

[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:53.500]
people are led by other folks to do whatever the good of the crowd is exactly yeah to go on with

[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:58.540]
what they believe in so you know stand on your own two feet only one god you have to stand for

[01:33:58.540 --> 01:34:05.520]
that's good don't forget it okay see I read it hurt you you know i'm saying we have an open

[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:09.240]
line in brown at five six seven i mean this is not maybe the most important thing in the world

[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:13.560]
but it's the beginning of saying they're making a statement isn't that what Jesse Jackson always says

[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:17.920]
you have to make a statement to get out of your predicament i wonder what he meant by that

[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:22.960]
because he'd be talking in rhyme and jive and bullcraft and what now we need him for anyway get

[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:27.660]
him out of here you know how his face is falling apart Jesse Clinton's nose keeps getting longer

[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:32.860]
and Jesse's face is falling apart what does that all mean it means the Lord works in mysterious ways

[01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:39.660]
and don't you ever forget it you heathen bastards here's Fort Lauderdale hello and how you doing okay

[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:46.100]
I'm a dolphin fan i go to most of the game and i won't stand no three don't just can't do it

[01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:50.260]
yeah they got you i don't think prayers gonna help the dolphins maybe they got you out there they're

[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:53.380]
doing a little ulaj before the game then maybe everybody that's what they need is

[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:57.880]
right out there at the 50-yard line before the game to give them a little bit of encouragement

[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:01.680]
that's yeah 100 degrees and i could just imagine you out there just giving them a huge

[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:06.480]
i'd be schmitz in my brains out i stand up for that all right all right see you there in the first

[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:12.500]

[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:15.740]
saying that Buddha's got a nice smooth head he's a skinhead for Christ sakes there's so much

[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:22.000]
confusion about that anyway it's 12 54 it's about the crap food out there and he's absolutely correct

[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.980]
and I'm sure he probably will bring in he'll probably have it catered some real food in there

[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:31.720]
so it doesn't have to eat that horn this crap that the Wayne is serving up anyway five minutes

[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:35.480]

[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:42.160]
PP stadium that's the deal you know moop and probably a few more than that and they got this

[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:47.260]
monopoly on Wednesday night baseball and they decide that we want to see the big unit and the

[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:51.360]
Greg Maddox I love Greg Maddox but quite frankly last part of the season he ain't been a shadow

[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:56.260]
of himself and the big unit who now wants to look at that who don't need to see a meaningless

[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:59.940]
game if we're gonna see a meaningless game let's see a meaningless game where there's somebody

[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:03.840]
performing this breakout kinds of records that people are excited about you idiots

[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:10.720]
here's a lady in four-letter deal hello hi Neil yes ma'am I have been a dolphin season taking

[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:17.280]
holder for 15 years I sit in section 139 but 27 and I know people behind me don't stand up for the

[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:22.560]
invocation I sure don't stand up for the invocation and it's ridiculous I mean it's not the Christian

[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:27.600]
football league not the Jewish football league right it's it's the Miami Dolphin's I'm paying

[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:32.480]
$38 to see a football game not to be re-lecchered by a priest so in other words there actually are

[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:36.500]
people with some balls who are sitting which have been screaming for years for people to do I

[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:42.000]
haven't stood I've never stood up for the invocation oh god bless you freedom of religion

[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.780]
means freedom from religion as well right if I'm paying for football game I shouldn't have to

[01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:53.560]
sit through a religious event sports are secular I mean when when people beg you to buy tickets to

[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:57.820]
go subsidize their business their event right and then they then they subject you to an

[01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:02.140]
embarrassing humiliating ritual like that how you know how how how long is it going to take

[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:06.760]
before the NFL finally wisers up and realizes that there's not another sport in the world

[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:12.140]
right not a soccer game not a rugby game not a cricket match not a tilly wings a chess game I mean

[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:16.360]
there's nothing where people are subjected to a prayer at a ballgame right I mean a perfect world

[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:21.140]
you know that's what sports is for sports are it transcends anything religious or political it's

[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:25.700]
so people can get together and unite behind a team you know unless they're fighting and getting

[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:30.000]
drunk but that's what it's about there's no one's not fighting and getting drunk was what it was

[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.720]
about if it all in games oh never mind oh that's why I stopped going anyway I don't stand and I

[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:39.740]
will not stand this year and I encourage everybody in my section I tell them they shouldn't stand

[01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:46.480]

[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:54.640]
thrill of the the baseball we have so little of that left in sports anymore at all at any level

[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:58.080]
that people should be saying this is the greatest thing there's even more segment and hit the

[01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:53.360]
fact that men love to fart but it's also a well-known fact one out of every fifteen

[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:59.780]

[01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:06.940]
aynis pain some farts just heard so in order to avoid this problem you need ring grow a trick used

by gay men for centuries ring grow actually widens your aynis giving your farts more room through

[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:18.220]

[02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:39.820]
get all 57 and the today's only the second is september well just in case he does an effect on

[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:47.800]
fox sports uh will interchange and they'll be showing the games and esp tweak uh will be televising

[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:52.640]
next money's opener of the cubs cardinal game well they're really dropping the ball tonight i'll

[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:56.880]
tell you this is a really bad mistake they're making the fact that the marlins can't televised

[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:02.360]
tonight and that espn is putting on a meaningless brave uh astro game just absolutely unconscionable

[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:05.740]
what are one of these people thinking about i thought it was hyzenna that we had to blame for

[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:10.260]
now it's espn you have to blame for they've got the exclusive ones that i write and they're putting

[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:13.960]
on first it was going to be the indians and the angels and then they switched to uh to the brave

[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:18.700]
and the uh astros because they think america wants to see greg maddox and randy johnson who gives

[02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:22.460]
a crap about greg maddox and randy johnson when you got a guy that's going to break a record and

[02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:26.640]
sit for five million years what are these people thinking about i guess they're not well we want mark

[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:31.440]
migwires love you nil okay sweet i love it yeah maybe toney bro i got some laughing gas and give it

[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:35.820]
all the executives they're an espn and they can't get their ass straightened out huh their astro straight

[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:42.760]
end out very very bad stupid idiotic decision by espn and thank god i'll be at the track plunge

[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:47.600]
in my brains out and don't have to worry about relying on espn to show us what people really want to see

[02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:54.540]
here's my emmy hello nil yes sir what do you all worked up about i'm surprised that you you

[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:09.100]
tune in and sit and wait through the adlanta hewston game to see when hell he's going to come up

[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:13.520]
i don't want to do that you want to watch the marlins while you're while you're waiting for it

championship i mean it'd be nice i don't know what difference does it make a preview to the

[02:03:30.540 --> 02:03:34.280]
national league championship when it becomes the national league championship then we'll see it

[02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:39.680]

[02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:43.100]

70 games of the devil raise and 70 games in the mounds they said they won't switch they won't

[02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:52.800]

[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:47.360]

[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:51.680]

[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:55.900]
in those seats in 101 Mitch and Andy from hollywood they're going to be sitting side by side

[02:06:55.900 --> 02:06:59.740]
in the seats that i would have had if the post office ever delivered my god damn male

[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:04.480]
okay don't forget the hanks coming out at the next from pp park formerly known as you know what

[02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:08.900]

[02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:11.820]
you're in big trouble at the crowskamp of the theater but nevertheless
