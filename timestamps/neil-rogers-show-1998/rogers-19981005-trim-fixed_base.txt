[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620]
Q-A-L.

[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.260]
In the wind, D-A-Y.

[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.940]
As you see, K-S.

[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.380]
All right.

[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.040]
It's a new deal is by the way, after somebody croaks Dennygne, be out at, that's the new deal.

[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.560]
Montgomery Cliff, book out about him, he was a fag.

[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.200]
Ooooo!

[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.200]
Let's see, who else?

[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.780]
Barbara Jordan, we already knew that.

[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.420]
She was a digh.

[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.060]
Ooooo!

[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.260]
Anthony Perkins, dead, he was a fag.

[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.580]
Barbara Stanwick, she was a digh.

[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.500]
To her own power, he was a fag.

[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.120]
Barbara Stanwick's second husband, Robert Taylor.

[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.420]
I remember Robert Taylor, he was like an Ivan Hoer stuff like that.

[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.760]
He was a fag.

[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.900]
And what would men we already knew that, that's old news.

[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.080]
So anyway, how long before the Roddy McDolleville comes out?

[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.880]
Jean Autry and Roddy McDolle in the same weekend.

[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.500]
Wow.

[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.080]
Pretty heavy duty.

[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.440]
Heavy duty stuff.

[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.260]
So anyway, I don't want to talk football because I don't talk football in the show, but

[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.060]
I do want to say this.

[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.280]
I get in the car, I was supposed to do it all in the game yesterday.

[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.140]
Boy, talk about us, news inducing event.

[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.380]
Good God.

[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.800]
And that asshole I called on Friday was giving me a song and a dance about how there's

[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.900]
more physical, football is more physical and hockey.

[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.640]
Those two or three assholes included in the New York Slaub, who, yeah, you're a schmuck.

[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.100]
You know, I'm watching that stuff yesterday and you're screaming at the set.

[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.480]
Let's play already and they stand around in the referee.

[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.880]
You know, before he blows it, he's a dick and around in the screw and around.

[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.340]
Blow it a whistle, get in the goddamn, a huddle, call a play, get up the line of

[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.160]
scribbling, let's play some football already.

[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.500]
Let's have some action.

[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.880]
Oh no, they're diddling around it, diddling around it, diddling around Jesus, Joseph

[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.720]
and the Sarah.

[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.080]
But at any rate, so I see that embarrassing, a humiliating performance.

[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.240]
One of the worst I have ever seen in my life by a dolphin team.

[00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.680]
I mean, unquestionably by any standard, I get in the car to go to the store and I'm listening

[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.120]
to these idiots calling up Kimba Bo camper and they're, they're whining.

[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.440]
We're about to officiating.

[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.500]
We're about to this and about that.

[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.500]
You know something, I'm going to tell you something.

[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.640]
It's a lost cause.

[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.000]
So maybe it's an every time, but in this town, trying to talk to, I mean, these dolphins,

[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.420]
if there are really such people, if they really understand the sport, that was a pathetic

[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.240]
performance yesterday by the team, by the coaching staff.

[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.420]
Good, golly, all the blind man could have done a better job coaching the team yesterday

[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.100]
to this guy.

[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.860]
I heard that Jets fan call the worst team.

[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.760]
I'm coming to work this morning.

[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.860]
Got a great chuckle out of that.

[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.480]
Have a couple more.

[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.160]
Donuts, Jimmy.

[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.000]
There you go.

[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.060]
What do you call them?

[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.780]
A bowling bowl with arms, something like that.

[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.140]
Oh, I loved it.

[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.560]
I mean, just pathetic.

[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.920]
Okay.

[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.940]
So it is only one game.

[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.620]
I grant you that.

[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.280]
But why can't you be honest?

[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.580]
Why is it the so called fans in this town?

[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.780]
Always have to have an excuse.

[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.740]
They have to blue sky.

[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.340]
They have to do all of a sudden the bullcrap.

[00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.960]
I don't know.

[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.360]
Maybe because they just don't know what the other talking about.

[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.260]
That could be it.

[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.280]
Could that be it?

[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.240]
Might just be.

[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.360]
So the house judiciary hearings are going out right now.

[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.120]
The house judiciary committees having their hands.

[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.180]
There is Bill McCallum from Florida.

[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.360]
Oh, geez.

[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.280]
God.

[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.220]
Pott him up for about one second.

[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.380]
That's a more serious.

[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.440]
Too much.

[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.140]
He had about a half a word.

[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.780]
Too much in there.

[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.460]
Better watch it, Mr.

[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.000]
So we had our big appearance at the gallery as Carol going to call us this morning.

[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.360]
Sometime are we going to because this thing is starting off very disorganized and slowly.

[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.380]
If you know what I mean, our center one campaign this year, which T shirt Tom.

[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.760]
Overcaptured glory made some great t shirts.

[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.800]
The best ever by the way this year they're black and they have on the front.

[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.840]
The cover of one of our CDs and on the back, they got the cover of the other CD in full

[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.080]
color and multicolor and really sharp.

[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.920]
I mean, these are great.

[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.820]
What do we sell six of these on a Saturday?

[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.540]
Maybe seven.

[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.520]
Maybe seven.

[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.020]
You know, tomorrow night at the pizza lot, the thing is going to determine for us.

[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.320]
I realize that the I got to tell you the gallery was very nice to us.

[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.480]
So I mean, the borders people over by the gallery.

[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.540]
But that particular location and you know, we had four people drive over all the way from

[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.940]
Fort Myers on Saturday.

[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.600]
All the way from Fort Myers, they drove over to come and pick up the best of CDs and say

[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.560]
hi to me and go on those stupid picture cards with a autograph and buy whatever else they

[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.380]
did and make their donations to center one.

[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.140]
Four people all the way from Fort Myers in the local area, they didn't brow it.

[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.940]
Not too much.

[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.000]
Maybe they couldn't find it.

[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.760]
Maybe they were like fat Joe from Moammy.

[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.620]
Maybe they're over the plantation borders looking around.

[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.680]
But if you live out in West Broward or anywhere west of anywhere, it's so awfully tough to get

[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.140]
over there because some rise Boulevard is a nightmare.

[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.300]
Jesus, why are they going to get that done sometime in our lifetime?

[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.500]
No, man.

[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.660]
From where I live out there in plantation, took me 45 fricking minutes to get there

[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.700]
because of the construction because you nerds up there on the weekend can't drive a lick.

[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.920]
You couldn't drive it if your life depended on it.

[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.340]
So it was a pretty poultry turnout.

[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.020]
Did we get a number?

[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.320]
Did Carol just call you or what?

[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.140]
And the number is, yes, we'll know in an hour about what they did downstairs.

[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.460]
But 1,110 upstairs.

[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.400]
Well, we already knew that.

[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.640]
Well, that's on old merchandise and the t-shirt.

[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.440]
It said has nothing to do with the new CDs and stuff.

[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.220]
But I thought what about the total for all the stores?

[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.600]
Are we going to be getting that every Monday?

[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.340]
Or is this going to be kind of a half-assed operation this year?

[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.680]
Because that's the feeling I get.

[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.060]
What?

[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.380]
Half-assed operation.

[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.600]
Well, I mean, what kind of a deal is that?

[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.400]
How do we have any idea of how much progress we're making?

[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.220]
How much we have to prod the natives out there?

[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.260]
What do we have to do with this thing to raise any money?

[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.780]
You can't do that just sitting back and waiting for a number to fall out of the sky.

[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.640]
Like the duck on the groucho,

[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.500]
Mark's show falling down with that...

[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.260]
Don't be fisticate.

[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.400]
Sign on its ass, on its beak.

[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.560]
So I don't know.

[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.500]
Maybe, you know, of course, I had forgotten two years ago

[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.080]
when we did the when borders all carried the stuff and stocked all of their stores.

[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.620]
Our live appearance is actually a war of diminishing importance because,

[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.340]
I mean, who the hell needs to see me?

[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.060]
And George and us assholes, you know?

[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.280]
When you can go into borders any day of the week at your convenience and pick up the best of CDs

[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.480]
and cassettes and what have you.

[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.760]
That's a point.

[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.160]
They had the dropped off dramatically.

[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.120]
I remember the old days when we started doing this and we'd go to whatever store it might have been.

[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.820]
And we do $78,000, $9,000 on a Saturday.

[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.320]
It was great.

[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.840]
But in the meantime, if you didn't chew up on that day,

[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.940]
those were the only opportunities.

[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.920]
And we raised only a fraction in those days for charity what we are right now.

[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.400]
We hope.

[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.960]
So all the border stores in Dayton,

[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.400]
Broward have got our best of CDs for $97,000 to $97,000.

[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.000]
They're great if we say so ourselves.

[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.420]
And if you want those or the t-shirts which are sensational,

[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.320]
which I'd sure be proud to wear if I could sew two of them together?

[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.740]
Ah, no, we'll be at the appease a lot.

[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.660]
Sixth day to clock tomorrow night, 35, 14th South University Drive.

[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.080]
You don't even have to buy a, come buy a, buy a meal.

[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.220]
You don't have to buy anything.

[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.320]
All you got to do is be alive because they set up the table out in front there.

[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.900]
And if you just want to, well, you know, make your donation and get the merchandise,

[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.640]
you don't even have to come in and see us.

[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.480]
Because then, Jeff will try to, you know, steer you over to the table and make you sit down and buy dinner.

[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.300]
If you do that, we hope you will do that, but nevertheless, it's your choice.

[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.460]
And I do want to say this, the guy with the eye showed up there on Saturday.

[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.720]
He was on his best behavior.

[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.020]
Oh, I saw him, Ken.

[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.620]
He said that from young, from young Kipper, he atoned for his sins.

[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.020]
And no, he did say that.

[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.400]
No, he's taken a turn for the best.

[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.620]
He was on his very good behavior and he was, he was okay.

[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.900]
And Gilbert was there and he was saying, I take me after that and as usual,

[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.700]
as only Gilbert could do acting like a real jerk.

[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.420]
And Fat Joe, our camera guy from Wamy, because Ron was there from our Wamy crew

[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.340]
and our, uh, waning, dying days on a Wamy show.

[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.900]
And Fat Joe, while we were waiting and waiting, if they could point out,

[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.380]
the Gilbert's putting on this incredible act.

[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.440]
Wouldn't it be great to have Fat Joe here with that camera?

[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.260]
I put this on the TV show so we can sprite, spoo, spoo, spoo sit up a little bit.

[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.040]
Well, Fat Joe was over at the borders in plantation is where he was.

[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.760]
Oi!

[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.660]
And by the time he got around to figuring out what day it was and calling it one-fifteen,

[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.700]
by the time he would have gotten from there to where we were,

[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.960]
we'd all been leaving anyway.

[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.980]
So we didn't get any of that.

[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.720]
So like I said, and starting tonight, by the way, the show on Wamy on Channel 69 is at 10.30 only,

[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.040]
but it will be from today.

[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.540]
It'll actually be like on the same day that you, uh, you know,

[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.060]
that you heard the radio show.

[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:20.820]
Is that going to make a difference?

[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:21.580]
No, of course not.

[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.300]
But I'm just telling you that just in case,

[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.280]
case you want to see these beautiful t-shirts from Tom over captured glory,

[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.660]
the near Rogers t-shirts, which I know most of you are too, uh, you know, too uptight

[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.160]
to walk out in public and we're there.

[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.420]
You can just walk where I'm in the house,

[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.140]
where I'm around the house and then have like a little bell on it.

[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.500]
So they're if you're going to go outside the building,

[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.760]
oh, better take this off before I go outside.

[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.500]
It's 10.09 at 5.60 WQA.

[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.980]
Don't you just need us.

[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.320]
I will.

[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.300]
So the house judiciary committee hearings are going on right now.

[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.500]
I'm sure that many people are sitting there just glued to their

[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.560]
sense watching this crap, which you're here's that the representative George Geek.

[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.400]
It's a trapezoid killer who's a pontificating.

[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.860]
You know, John Connures for president.

[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.600]
That's what I say.

[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:06.780]
Oh,

[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.220]
the collection's a little bit too dark.

[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.480]
There's a guy who's brilliant.

[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.660]
He's a genius, too smart for most of you folks.

[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.480]
But in any way, it's interesting how the media continues playing this crap.

[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.460]
This is one of the saddest chapters in the history of the human race and especially of this country.

[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.300]
A country that's like a very, very fond of apetting itself on the back

[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.760]
and writing a while and talking about how great we are and how much better we are in everybody else

[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.440]
and yada yada yada yada and etc.

[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.940]
The fact that we have a crappy education system and most of our people are functionally illiterate

[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.860]
and are a helpful care system sucks beside those don't confuse us with the facts.

[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.220]
And at the time when the world markets are going in a crapper and they're killing each other

[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.660]
in Yugoslavia and all over the goddamn world and Saddam is just a few months away from

[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.500]
making nuclear weapons.

[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.720]
What are I doing this?

[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.040]
And the world will live hopefully to one day just absolutely universally condemn

[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.960]
this country for the procedure that's going on right now.

[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.260]
And to show you the way, the fair-minded way to media are conducting this so-called public

[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:07.880]
investigation buried on page 9a in the sun, not on the front page, but buried on page 9a

[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.280]
in the Sunsandalus morning.

[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.800]
Grand jurors curious about trips motives.

[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.060]
And it goes on to talk about how the grand jury grilled this bitch and found out that over a year

[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.420]
before all of this star got involved in this so-called Monica Gain investigation, she was

[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.320]
opening up a loose lip and talking about all this stuff with the attorneys for Apollo Jones.

[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.360]
And the Kenster also was involved at that time.

[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.420]
And it says if trip as she maintained nearly one of the tapes to protect her against the

[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.860]
perjury charge if she were ever forced to testify in the Jones case about Lewinsky and was not

[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.740]
interested in a book deal, what was so thrilling about these passages that you were wondered

[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:46.260]
that she was talking with Lucienne Goldberg about, for example, the two occasionally wise cracking,

[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.300]
excitedly discussed revelations from Lewinsky about Clinton's penis size.

[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.440]
How do you like that?

[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.520]
So evidently, just like Rick Weber would say, he might have been penisized.

[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.040]
Oh, we don't have that in here. Damn it.

[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.680]
Wouldn't that have been great if we would have had that?

[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.260]
But we don't.

[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.280]
Crap.

[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.860]
So there you go. That's on page 9a, by the way, if anybody out there wants to read this,

[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.720]
you have to dig way into the upfront sections and maybe your back sections and newspapers,

[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.240]
dig into the articles about what's really going on here.

[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.180]
Because unfortunately, the media for whatever reason they're like, go well,

[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.880]
because they're making a lot of money off of all of this, that's one of the reasons for funding

[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.480]
profit. And absolute, national disgrace.

[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.940]
Okay, on the much brighter side, am I going to give away my tickets to the pan through a

[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.660]
Tampa Bay opening game this Friday at the beautiful Macarena, along with that club parking pass?

[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.880]
No, yes, I am.

[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.740]
Like I said, I got him right here. I'm not going to be here.

[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.120]
I don't want to empty seats in section 101 there.

[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.260]
And you pour bastards that sit like a regular seats inside, not on the ends on the aisles.

[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.280]
Yeah, your seats are a little bit narrower than the New Arena.

[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.860]
You don't want too bad because I'm on the aisle.

[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.100]
Na na na na na na.

[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.680]
There you go.

[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.840]
I'm on the aisle so I can kind of like spread out a little bit with my big fat ass and my legs

[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.880]
over there. They don't have to worry about being pinched in real tight in those little narrow seats

[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.500]
because we need to make the extra money.

[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.060]
So what we'll do today is that we'll take names any of the callers between now and like 145.

[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.940]
And then these are definitely for pickup, by the way, I'm not taking a chance

[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.900]
on you mailing these out because it's already Monday and the game is Friday night.

[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.080]
So they'll have to pick these up along with a parking pass for Friday.

[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.440]
And anybody who would like to be right, just here we'll just take your name and address.

[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.280]
We'll do a drawing at about 145 for the Panther tickets.

[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.960]
My own in my own goddamn seats.

[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.820]
You'll be able to stick your ass this Friday night.

[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.020]
Panthers in Tampa Bay, not the world's greatest opponent, but nevertheless, that's what we got.

[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.900]
Here's a lady mobile in Miami. Hello.

[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.080]
Hi, I was wondering when the NHL waiver draft is.

[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.900]
The NHL waiver draft is today.

[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.220]
Yes, what time?

[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.560]
What time is it? I don't have any idea.

[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:46.520]
Hello, Pete.

[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.960]
Do you have any idea of who's going to pick up on the Panthers?

[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.080]
No, I don't.

[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.780]
I know who they're going to get rid of.

[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.700]
Hopefully, and that's Kirk Muller and the Jeff Norton and Terry Carcner, hopefully.

[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:56.460]
Hmm.

[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.240]
All right. How about those tickets for Friday night?

[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.000]
You're already on hold, sweetheart.

[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.620]
No chance.

[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.020]
I would be, I'm not even going to register.

[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.180]
She was already on hold.

[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.200]
She didn't call to talk about the Panthers.

[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.240]
She was already just interested in sucking her over the, I'll put anybody else on the list

[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:11.720]
for the tickets.

[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.500]
Okay, for the drawing, but not her, because she was already on there.

[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.320]
She called me for the show even started.

[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.520]
Under the pretense of having a conversation with me, see, this is the way I played the game.

[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.260]
If you want to play games with me, like Michael said in Godfather 3,

[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.580]
a lot of play games with us will play with you.

[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:28.840]
But I'd be credible.

[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.180]
Would you ever Godfather that was in?

[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.000]
Which one was it?

[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.620]
Here's a mobile and four-letter, hello.

[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:34.900]
Hello.

[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:35.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:36.840]
How you doing?

[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:37.220]
Okay.

[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.660]
I know you don't like to talk about football, but since you started it,

[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.160]
I just, uh, absolutely.

[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.260]
I'm a true dolphin fan.

[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.300]
How can you talk about football in the town where nobody knows anything about it?

[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.020]
Oh, absolutely, but they were pitiful.

[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.380]
This discussion, that game was disgusting.

[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.320]
The coaching, the playing, everything.

[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.460]
Same old preface.

[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.520]
If you take the one touchdown drive,

[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.640]
latent the game, if you take those statistics out of the game,

[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.660]
the numbers are so embarrassing that little league teams,

[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.880]
that little middle school football teams would be in Paris to go through all the

[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:09.460]
math.

[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.300]
Every time they think it's going out in the town,

[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.340]
they always got mixed.

[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.460]
They just don't say we got our bus kick and that's that.

[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.200]
Why can't they just say they're stuck?

[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:18.840]
That's right.

[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.400]
They're stuck.

[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.400]
But I wanted to make it down there to see up orders,

[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.320]
but I had too many things to do around my house.

[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.960]
I'll tell you the comment on Saturday was bitterly disappointing, sir,

[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.240]
compared to the other days very weak, very weak.

[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.600]
I should have been there.

[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.600]
You should have been there, sir.

[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:35.200]
I could have made it.

[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.980]
See, everybody else has got something more important.

[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:37.960]
I'm old hat.

[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:38.820]
I'm old news.

[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.200]
Okay.

[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.500]
Everybody else has got something more important.

[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.200]
We'll see at Pizza Love tomorrow night,

[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.520]
whether we have all our friends show up,

[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.940]
or if it's going to be another one of those deals,

[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.540]
we sit around or eat in our pasta bar.

[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.000]
So in a corner, we'll see.

[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.520]
Yeah, I might be able to make one.

[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.920]
Is that what are you going to be up pizza,

[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.360]
off tomorrow night, six to eight PM tomorrow night, six to eight.

[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.600]
I mean, that sounds good.

[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.000]
I live right down the street.

[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.200]
Well, for crying out loud,

[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.840]
I should I should make it over there.

[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.760]
You should, but you know, I can tell by the sound in your voice, you won't.

[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.500]
No, I have to come.

[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.500]
I have to come by myself.

[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.680]
My wife doesn't like it.

[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.960]
Why not? What's her problem?

[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.380]
She doesn't have a problem.

[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.020]
She just doesn't listen.

[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:14.900]
She doesn't understand.

[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.280]
She doesn't understand.

[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.640]
In other words, she's a stupid bitch.

[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.540]
No, she don't say that.

[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.540]
I wouldn't say that.

[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.240]
Well, how smart do you have to be to understand this show?

[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.020]
Do you have to be a rocket scientist to get it school?

[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.440]
She's at school a lot of times during your show.

[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.400]
She's at school taking what?

[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.800]
Life, life 101?

[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.520]
No computers.

[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.260]
Wow.

[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.980]
Well, that explains it.

[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:36.500]
I'll do those things.

[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.520]
That explains it.

[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.860]
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow night, pal.

[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.720]
Could I suck around with me on that list?

[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.380]
Okay, hold on.

[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:41.720]
Sure.

[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.340]
Okay, we got two open lines in date,

[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.220]
five, six, seven,

[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:45.800]
oh, five, six,

[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.220]
eight, five,

[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.920]
six, the only, a mobile one line.

[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.780]
Yeah, the women just take you.

[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:50.580]
Don't you understand?

[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.640]
No, I really don't.

[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.000]
Somebody don't have to drum me a diagram.

[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.520]
I've been asking for 600 years.

[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.560]
What is that all about?

[00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.260]
But that's okay.

[00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.420]
It's okay.

[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.940]
Hey, do I, be my guest, be a bitter and obnoxious.

[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.560]
Doll collector assumes over state of balding Barbie.

[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.420]
Oh, you see this story?

[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.940]
A Barbie doll is at the center of a lawsuit

[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.480]
in which a Canadian collector claims

[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.480]
that a rare 1960s version she bought

[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.140]
over the internet had a severe case of plumdome.

[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.880]
Maybe it was a Wayne High Pingup Barbie doll.

[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.940]
Janice Amonson, a Barbie collector bought the doll

[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.940]
in March from a Maryland woman for $1800.

[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.700]
When she opened the box, she found the dolls here had gotten brittle

[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.760]
and was falling out, said Joseph Hovermill, her attorney.

[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.800]
It was not in the near-mid condition she was led to believe.

[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.280]
Celerlory Maddox said Edminson tried to die to hear.

[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.200]
She said,

[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.240]
There's whom would you look at?

[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.340]
I'm dying over here.

[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.080]
It was in perfect condition when I'm ill to do it.

[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.580]
And I have pictures to prove it, Maddox said.

[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.440]
Amonson said Maddox posted an internet message

[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.360]
claiming that Amonson spoiled the doll

[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.140]
for lawsuit $200,000 from breach of contract and defamation.

[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.200]
I bet you they wind up on the Apuples Court

[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.580]
or on Judge Crotch or any one of those 5,000 Judge Judy

[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.420]
to hang in bitch.

[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.480]
Isn't this what I've told you about television all along

[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.720]
by the way for many, many years?

[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.900]
You get one cowboy show, it's hit.

[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.640]
Now you got 500 cowboy shows.

[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.160]
You had one quay show as a bigot.

[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.680]
Now we got 500 quay shows.

[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.380]
You had one detective, one cop show.

[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.920]
Now there are 2,000 cop shows.

[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.780]
And then as soon, you know, nobody wanted to go in there

[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.160]
and take on Wapner, which by the way, they had a mistake.

[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.680]
It wasn't in the heraldor to sunset yesterday.

[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.740]
They had a picture of Ed Crotch and it said Wapner under it.

[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.520]
Nice going, Sun Sentinel, Ewhiddeoth.

[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.980]
But nobody else wanted to take on Judy.

[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.920]
We got 75,000 Judge Hanging Judges on air on TV now.

[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.580]
Because that's what TV is all about.

[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.720]
It's sameness.

[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:39.780]
Sameness.

[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.200]
And I got a story for you.

[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.980]
Thanks very much to our Paisano K.

[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.200]
By Saturday, one of my launchmen will warn me about this story.

[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.160]
And I dug the Sun Sentinel.

[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.300]
Saturday Sun Sentinel out of the trash bin.

[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.480]
Because I never read the world, section.

[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.660]
I mean, it's about the world.

[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.560]
You know what we got so many exciting things going on here.

[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.420]
A cardinal's beatification draws fire.

[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.160]
And it's about the, you know, and and verifies what I always said.

[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.140]
The Vatican never met a Nazi.

[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:05.720]
They didn't like.

[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.840]
So I'll go into that story later.

[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.180]
Also in yesterday's Sun Sentinel, which I'm surprised you.

[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.480]
People are so slow.

[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.980]
In the radio and TV in the TV book.

[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.200]
There's my push.

[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:16.780]
Do you see this?

[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.400]
Tom Jicke.

[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.480]
You know what?

[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.580]
This is amazing.

[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.860]
I mean, we must have some people out there with balled eyesight.

[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.140]
With balled eyesight.

[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.180]
Because if you look at it, Tom, you'll have balled eyes.

[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.300]
I mean, Tom is a good guy, but he's.

[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.340]
Yeah, they don't have any here.

[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.780]
I mean, I have at least some hair in the front.

[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.680]
Some in the back.

[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.180]
Some in the front.

[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:34.800]
None on top.

[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.500]
None in between.

[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.880]
But at least it appears from the front that I might have.

[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.160]
Some air.

[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.440]
Tom has like six hairs that are combed across his head.

[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.620]
So somebody writes, did you know that if you draw glasses on your photo in the paper,

[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.340]
you're a dead ringer for neo-rodgers.

[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.840]
Are you two brothers?

[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.220]
Did X from a TR and coal gables?

[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.580]
Answer from Tom.

[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.600]
Instead of drawing glasses on my picture, you ought to have yourself fitted for a pair.

[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:04.060]
There is absolutely no resemblance or familiar relationship between Neil and me.

[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.060]
Says Tom Jicke.

[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.960]
I do like that.

[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.960]
And but at least they got my picture in there in the Sun Sentinel.

[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.720]
I've got time.

[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.660]
Thank God for you.

[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.900]
Keep my pus alive.

[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:12.920]
I need it, man.

[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.600]
These days I need it bad.

[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.340]
Can't raise any money for set a one.

[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.380]
We had a horrendous turn out there on Saturday.

[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.820]
We just finished up a week here on this show that I wouldn't wish on it all Hitler.

[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.000]
We're doing a drawing for my Panther ticket.

[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.620]
And we still have one open line in date.

[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.840]
We still got one line that's not lit up there in date.

[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.220]
And we're taking names and numbers.

[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.720]
Absolutely unbelievable.

[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.200]
That's the way things have degenerated here on this radio station.

[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.400]
There are a bunch of degenerates.

[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.660]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one.

[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.560]
I don't let me forget to read that story about the Pope.

[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.380]
And this a Nazi asshole.

[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.420]
That they they've made him into it.

[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.640]
They're making him into a saint.

[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:51.620]
That's right.

[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.700]
They're making him into a big saint.

[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.240]
Of course he never met a Nazi didn't like.

[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.920]
So it kind of ties right in, don't it?

[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.320]
Here's camera.

[00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:57.800]
Hello.

[00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:58.920]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.400]
Okay, sir.

[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.640]
I didn't know Tom Jicke was your brother.

[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.380]
He's my kissing cousin now.

[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.180]
Well, your mom must be proud.

[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.020]
She's got one on TV.

[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:05.780]
So bad.

[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.640]
Yeah, she's got one on TV and one on radio.

[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:07.880]
Right.

[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.280]
So mommy must be proud.

[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.040]
What on the newspaper?

[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.240]
Yeah, what's going to call you about that article on Saturday,

[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.180]
about the Pope and the gentleman that died and he's kneeling down

[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.500]
on the footstep of the two.

[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.620]
He's kneeling on it.

[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.340]
Yeah, he's an elite.

[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.260]
Oh boy, I'm telling you something else.

[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.080]
And this town is going crazy.

[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.700]
You see no jet fans are calling today, huh?

[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.160]
Meaning what?

[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.160]
But I'm a Yankee fan.

[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.760]
So I would you know something if the jet fans did call all the

[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.840]
sports shows on this station.

[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.540]
They deserve to.

[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:31.840]
Why not?

[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:32.580]
That's right.

[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.200]
As much as I can't stand some of them,

[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.020]
but nevertheless, they ought to be rubbing it in.

[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.460]
The Dolphin Stuck to join out yesterday.

[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.100]
And when you talk a big game, when you talk a lot of trash,

[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.620]
like a lot of the Dolphin fans were talking last week,

[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.400]
and they're going to go up there again and kick their ass like they usually do

[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.240]
up there in a metal land.

[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.860]
And they go up there and put on a performance like we saw yesterday.

[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.920]
That was pathetic.

[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:51.600]
I didn't hear that.

[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.760]
But that it would be a compliment.

[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.480]
I didn't hear the voices wanting to play JETS Stuck Stuck Stuck Stuck this morning too, right?

[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:57.200]
They did.

[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.020]
They were kind of quiet.

[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.700]
No, they were very subdued.

[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.340]
Yeah, I wonder why.

[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.180]
You know, I want to know.

[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.240]
I don't listen to that show.

[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.100]
I want to know one thing.

[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.800]
I want to win Joe Rose is finally going to beat the crap out of Guilty.

[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.140]
No, he's going to bring in his brother-in-law to do it.

[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:09.540]
Yeah.

[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:10.960]
All right, sir.

[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.300]
I guess I'll see you on Tuesday.

[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:12.800]
OK.

[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.180]
I couldn't make it to the Gaila Rear.

[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.120]
I'll see you tomorrow night.

[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:15.600]
All right, sir.

[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:15.800]
OK.

[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:16.120]
I'm going to list.

[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.000]
OK, hang right.

[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:19.940]
I almost hung up on him.

[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.800]
He wants to list, too.

[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.200]
I guess they all want to be on the list.

[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.520]
Maybe if you don't want to be on the list, you should tell us.

[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:24.820]
OK?

[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.520]
Because for me, that would be getting a little bit carried away.

[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.740]
A little bit uppity, don't you think?

[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.680]
Oh, the Dow's down 86.

[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.340]
The NASDAQ is down 51 already.

[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.180]
Oh, it's going to be a real mean nasty day there.

[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.200]
And they're worried about the penis gate.

[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.160]
Here's the president had sex and lied about it and tried to cover up

[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.300]
and elicit affair with some bimbo who goes on a great length of a.

[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.880]
In fact, the worst that here it is, sex shrink files on Monica.

[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.060]
I got so much stuff today.

[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.800]
I may not even have time to talk to these idiots.

[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:54.760]
That's right.

[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.060]
Long before she set her sights on Clinton, Monica Lewinsky turned

[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:03.300]
to Dr. Irene Kassola in a bid to tame her passion for older married men.

[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.240]
And she goes on a great length about how she can't help herself.

[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.120]
And she pursues them and stalks them and haunts them, etc. and so on.

[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.640]
Poor old Monica that we have to feel so sorry for it

[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.380]
with that bad, dry cleaning bill.

[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.560]
With no dry cleaning bill?

[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.200]
Tent, Q-A-L, steal Roger's God.

[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:26.380]
When I was a young man, women weren't allowed to show any skin at all.

[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.940]
In fact, they were thought to be quite trampy indeed.

[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.140]
If they showed a man even an inch of their neckline.

[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.440]
Wow, thank goodness we're finished with that crap.

[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:42.500]
And now, for men like me who have missed out on all those years of foyering,

[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.000]
we've got the flesh for both these networks.

[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.540]
Hey, grandpa, that's you never seen a woman do this before.

[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.480]
Oh my God, where's my Viagra?

[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.820]
This course too high on my stroke ability skill to pass off.

[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.660]
It's the network you've been waiting your whole life for.

[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.380]
Young babes showing off all their goods to you.

[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.880]
They hear too far deprived elderly men of America.

[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.280]
Welcome to Talk 30 TV with Holly, my elder little for boy.

[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.680]
How'd you like to rest your tired old head on this paranoccus?

[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.160]
But, yes.

[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.380]
Hello, sir.

[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:19.500]
Are you there?

[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.320]
A flesh for all these network will not your socks off.

[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.060]
Or, stop your heart.

[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.280]
Either way, it's money well spent.

[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.660]
Call your local cable company today.

[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.880]
1032-560-2M, we have two open lines in 05-670-560-050-560.

[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.520]
On the mobile one line, judge tells teen thief to forego sex for two and a half years.

[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.300]
This is one of the great stories I've ever written my life.

[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.180]
Cambridge Illinois.

[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.940]
A judge told a teenager who pleaded guilty to stealing handguns

[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:52.100]
that he must remain celibate for two and a half years unless he gets married.

[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.960]
Okay, pleaded guilty to stealing handguns and the judges giving him sex,

[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.920]
not advice, but orders.

[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:06.260]
Brandon Stevens, 17, was sentenced to 30 months probation, 180 days in jail, and a $2,000

[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.800]
fine. Henry County Judge Clark Barnes said Stevens will not have to serve jail time

[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.540]
if he completes treatment at a halfway house and meets conditions that include the celibacy rule.

[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.340]
Prosecutor Ted Hamer said the requirement was based on the judges learning in court

[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:24.720]
that Stevens was sexually active and not because of any sexually related charges.

[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.400]
The ACLU said Stevens' sex life is none of the judges' business, how do you like that?

[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.800]
No, no, it's what they said.

[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.020]
Oh, you got that business.

[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.220]
You will pervert.

[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.540]
The sex police are alive and well-american.

[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.980]
It's not just the president, baby, but even everybody else.

[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.380]
We got judges, Tonya, we're to stick in when you can do it and don't do it.

[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.080]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:45.380]
Hello.

[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.440]
I'm Corneo. How you doing today, sir?

[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:47.940]
Okay, sir.

[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.020]
I'm Corneo. I've about had it.

[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.180]
Canceling my Miami-Herald description.

[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:59.340]
I mean, Sunday's article by Dan LeBasterd has been, I mean, that was the last draw.

[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.780]
He had 20 questions with Bobby Bowden.

[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.440]
Yeah, I didn't read it.

[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.880]
Well, who now cares about Bobby Bowden?

[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.340]
I mean, but the guy didn't even ask sports questions.

[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:07.760]
Yeah.

[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.220]
He asking them, well, what do you think about Clinton?

[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.060]
Well, you ought to quit reading that column.

[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:12.660]
It's really weak.

[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.340]
We have an open line in day one and Broward, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5,

[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.860]
60, Pond, 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:22.420]
See, when a guy comes out and starts screaming at a lot about something as insignificant as Dan LeBasterd,

[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.740]
then, you know, he's got no material.

[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.540]
Here's a mobile in Kendall, hello.

[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.040]
Deal.

[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:27.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:34.660]
I was taking a little trip up to New York this weekend and I got an interesting perspective on the

[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:39.200]
Marlins award deal from fans up there, the Real Baseball Fans.

[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.980]
And they, uh, I told them off this off, you know, the fans aren't so far to how they

[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.320]
buy tickets and then they show off.

[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.820]
And this is the start team in the field.

[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.160]
Well, do you think it wants that further?

[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.520]
They think the moral of the community to crime against baseball because they think that

[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.960]
the moral of the set of precedents that other teams in the future may follow.

[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.400]
And it's going to further ruin the game of baseball.

[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.540]
Do you think about that?

[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.680]
I don't.

[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.300]
I don't think other teams are going to follow it.

[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:04.720]
Yeah.

[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.820]
And the other teams that have already done it like the pirates.

[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.040]
Well, they're not going to do what?

[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.060]
Go ahead.

[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.720]
Now, people aren't going to do something because Wayne did it.

[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.200]
They're going to see the whole thing.

[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.160]
It's not just the Marlins.

[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.920]
The whole thing has to do with professional sports.

[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.740]
I just watched this series on CBC about the National Hockey League and the agents and the

[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.660]
players and all agreed that's going on.

[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.640]
And the fact that a lot of these smaller market teams like Edmonton, uh, Winnipeg already

[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.020]
went out.

[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.060]
Quebec already went out and you just can't make it.

[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:36.700]
If the fans out there continue supporting the idea that these guys are worth eight and

[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:40.040]
ten and twelve and fifteen and twenty million dollars a year, where the hell is the money

[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:40.720]
going to come from?

[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.440]
And then the fans turn around and start pitching.

[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.220]
Well, gee, we don't want to spend 80-100 bucks to go to see a game.

[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.320]
Well, who the hell do think is going to pay for the salaries?

[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:48.880]
It's true.

[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.560]
I just, uh, I think with the Marlins this year was a big, uh, big time.

[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.180]
Well, there's no question.

[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.360]
Over and over and over.

[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.920]
They were out of the call of duty was one of the most grotesque thing that's ever been

[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.080]
done.

[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.720]
But you know why he was able to do it here?

[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.680]
Because nobody cared because they let him do it.

[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.160]
There was no uprising in his town and you know something they still averaged about

[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.320]
twenty thousand people again.

[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.880]
Even with this kind of crap that he put out there in a field, they still averaged

[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.480]
twenty thousand people again because the people are too stupid to make any kind of a statement.

[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.840]
Only in my opinion.

[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.600]
Hey, do you know what I want to get on the list?

[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:18.480]
Okay, hang on.

[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.240]
Okay, he's on the word hell he is.

[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:21.720]
He's on hold.

[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.240]
I mean, there's no point.

[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.000]
I mean, that's still a cryover yesterday's match.

[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.120]
Potato's nobody cared about it several months ago.

[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.260]
Nobody cares about it now.

[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.660]
He did it because he was able to do it.

[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:31.860]
He knows where the hell he is.

[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.840]
And just like the New Arena like our Mac Arena.

[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.360]
I mean, you know, I mean, I hope hoping for the best.

[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.780]
And we'll see what happens in that waiver draft today this afternoon if they actually

[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:42.680]
do pick up some talent.

[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.420]
You know, one of the things that the Panther Organization kept screaming was going to

[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.380]
happen after last year.

[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.040]
Oh, well, we've got to improve our gold telling.

[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:49.840]
It's got to be better.

[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.240]
Well, do they improve the gold telling?

[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.180]
No, first thought.

[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:57.000]
You mean to tell me that Sean Burke and Captain Jerk Kirk McLean that they're better

[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.380]
than the Beezer and either Mark Fitzpatrick or Weeks that we had at the time.

[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.220]
Whoever the hell was here with the Beezer, are they better?

[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:03.980]
No, of course not.

[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:04.740]
They didn't do that.

[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.700]
They got some good young kids out there.

[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:08.840]
But we've been here in that for years.

[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.700]
You know, what your good young kids do in exhibition games and what they do under the

[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.920]
pressure of a real game, that remains to be seen.

[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:15.800]
Right, Joe Thornton?

[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:16.480]
There you go.

[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.660]
So that's a good promise again, but he just keeps doing this because the people

[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.620]
keep packing a place.

[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.580]
We got over 16,000 season tickets because the excitement of the New Arena that we

[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.280]
built for him.

[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.000]
So he just keeps squeezing every dime out that he can because there were the suckers that

[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.100]
keep subsidizing it.

[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:38.540]
We have two open lines and day one and Broward, 5.6705, 60.560 on a mobile one line.

[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.520]
Mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:40.780]
Hello?

[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:41.920]
Hey, Neil.

[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.500]
How are you?

[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:42.960]
Okay, sir.

[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.380]
Neil, the way you just spent in Clinton, have you been on your knees in the overlautous

[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:47.380]

[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.100]
Oh, please.

[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.140]
Blow it out your ass.

[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:49.560]
Okay.

[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.300]
The way I defend Clinton and 70% of the American public, that's right.

[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.380]
And all the, I guess all the Americans that defend Clinton must be on their knees.

[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.780]
That must be what it's all about.

[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.360]
Now the fact is here that most guys like it and head, okay?

[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.840]
Most guys like it and their rocks off, including most of the presidents who preceded

[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:05.980]
them.

[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.300]
And if that's the most important thing that you can worry about, if that's the greatest

[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:13.120]
indictment condemnation you can make him, then he must be doing a pretty good job.

[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.500]
We have an open line on the best of Neil, part one and two this year.

[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.680]
And of course, this cut is not on there because it doesn't belong to us as a Bob and

[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:20.860]
Tom.

[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.040]
So what's the one that everybody picks out and even the people that we had show up on

[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.560]
Saturday at the board, are borders?

[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.960]
Oh, you mean prison, but you're not here.

[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.000]
It's a, oh, jeez.

[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.280]
It doesn't belong to us.

[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:39.660]
Plus you've already heard it 50 billion 275 million 612,000 and four times five now.

[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.700]
But hey, that's our crowd.

[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:49.400]
Sex-ranked files on Monica, Monica Lewinsky, secret sex files reveal a vulnerable young woman

[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.580]
addicted to older married men.

[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:58.660]
This is from the one source of news that never lets us down the star, the greatest

[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.380]
tabloid, the greatest publication far way and above better than time and news week

[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.840]
and the Washington Post and New York Times, etc.

[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.720]
Star has learned that Monica confided in her longtime therapist, L.A.

[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:15.340]
psychologist to the stars, Dr. Irene Kassorla, that there's hardly a guy I can't

[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.300]
get when I put my mind to it, including the president.

[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.680]
I'm always attracted to the older married one she revealed, according to sources

[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.920]
familiar with her confidential therapy, dossier, dossier, file, folder.

[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.300]
I like the power I have over them once I've got them hooked.

[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.020]
She said eventually they become addicted to me and I'm addicted to them.

[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.220]
Lot of addicted going on.

[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.720]
Monica's been undergoing intense therapy for six years to help her beat her up session.

[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.880]
How come we're not hearing about this on the nation lightly news?

[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.320]
From the time she left high school in 1992, right through her 18 month affair with

[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:52.460]
President Clinton, she was receiving help from Kassorla initially in person then by phone.

[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:57.320]
Most of my therapies concentrated on stopping me from being a sexual predator,

[00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:02.560]
predator who goes after older, vulnerable married men, guys who are flattered by my

[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.280]
attention revealed Monica 25.

[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.580]
Young guys just don't turn me on.

[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.840]
She confided to Dr. Kassorla, who was given permission, viola,

[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.600]
when she'd a breaker clamp therapist privilege.

[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.680]
I find young guys stupid.

[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.500]
She said all hands in nasty.

[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.560]
I can't stand them all hands.

[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.640]
Wait until you hear this.

[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:25.100]
Monica even admitted that when her lovers found out about her emotional problem and tried

[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.680]
to dump her, she would threaten to expose them.

[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.560]
Sources say that Kassorla and expert on relationships in the author of

[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.300]
three best telling books was deeply alarmed when Monica confessed to her affair with

[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.380]
President Clinton in one of their phone therapy sessions.

[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.760]
Monica used the name Henrietta when talking about Clinton on the phone.

[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.040]
You're heading for disaster.

[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.360]
This could wreck both your lives.

[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.400]
Kassorla warned her patient.

[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.280]
You're making the same mistakes you made in the past, but Monica refused to heed

[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.700]
the warnings and fully expected to be the next Mrs. Clinton.

[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.380]
I can do anything with Bill.

[00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.540]
He's putty in my hand.

[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.480]
She boasted he's sick and tired of Hillary.

[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.060]
He thinks she's an old lady who wants to have somebody young and a fresh in his life.

[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.640]
I could even end up the woman he marries when he leaves office.

[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.000]
That's how much he thinks of me.

[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.180]
She saved when Kassorla asked Monica whether she was deluding herself.

[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.300]
A winski told her I'll never give him up.

[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.520]
I want him more than any other man I've ever met.

[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:23.020]
But when Clinton put an end to their fling, Lille Winski was devastated and out for revenge.

[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.560]
He tried to get rid of me and broke my heart.

[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.140]
I warned him that I couldn't live without him.

[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.980]
She told a friend when Lewinsky was first taken to see Kassorla by her mom,

[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.780]
Marsha Lewis, the psychologist quickly discovered that Monica exhibited classic symptoms

[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.300]
of the stalker.

[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.880]
All this poor young girl, this poor young intern, the stalker.

[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.280]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.640]
Monica was a girl who fell violently in love with school teachers, college professors,

[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.820]
with the men she worked for, even with their father's married male friends,

[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.520]
something her family tried to hush up says a family friend.

[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.520]
She told me I can't help myself.

[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.780]
I go after them with everything.

[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.540]
I give them what they want, what they don't get from their wives.

[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.460]
That's why they love me.

[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.660]
And that's what she was talking about.

[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.220]
And her testimony to the grand jury investigating president Clinton,

[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.380]
Lewinsky admitted she has a sexual problem.

[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.600]
There's work I need to do on myself.

[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.260]
She told the jurors, frankly, just give her a big stogie.

[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.620]
Give her an in-mento and let her go do some work on herself.

[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.700]
That's what I say.

[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.100]
How do you like that?

[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.300]
Give her a big fat one, baby, in a cigar too.

[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:34.960]
A stalker who threatens to expose the older men when they try to break it off

[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.940]
in a relationship too.

[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:36.980]
Nice going to it, Art.

[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.700]
Bitch. Here's Miami.

[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.160]
Hello. Hello, Neil.

[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:41.560]
How you doing?

[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:42.000]
OK, sir.

[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.220]
Neil, I used to be a huge dolphin.

[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.740]
I used to watch them all the time season ticket holder.

[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.880]
Man, these games have been abysmal.

[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.860]
You can watch them.

[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.300]
Yeah.

[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.300]
I mean, the boring is on, especially this year and last year.

[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:54.800]
Terminal.

[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.120]
I mean, there was there was one game yesterday.

[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.400]
I'm trying to think of the rainy others.

[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.180]
I mean, in England, New Orleans game, that's her not to be hell of a game.

[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.000]
Thanks to that bonehead play on that punt.

[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.520]
But under other than that, I mean, the, oh, God,

[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.440]
just ponderous.

[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.100]
I think you have to do it with the expansion.

[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:12.440]
I mean, the expansion has watered it down and the, the action is so slow and ponderous

[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.600]
and they stand around and you wait, come on, line the clock.

[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.440]
Let's get that arm playing around there.

[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.320]
Let's get something gold.

[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.420]
Get them up to the line of scrimmage.

[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.000]
It's very sad.

[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.080]
Hockey's on the same track though.

[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:21.440]
Huh?

[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.540]
Hockey's on the same track.

[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:23.060]
Both along.

[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.780]
Well, thank God it's going off of Fox after this year.

[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:27.340]
That's true.

[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.680]
And you know, no, no, Hockey's got Europe.

[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:30.340]
No, you can't.

[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:30.640]
No, sir.

[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.740]
Hockey has got Europe and all of the rest of the world.

[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:34.560]
The draw from OK.

[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.500]
They got Scandinavian.

[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.160]
They got the Russians.

[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.520]
That's why what's saving hockey?

[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.660]
OK, we got all three lines in date open as usual.

[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.860]
No matter what we're doing or giving away, that's no difference in date.

[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.480]
County 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line.

[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.420]
Here's a lady in sunrise.

[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:48.840]
Hello.

[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:50.220]
Nail.

[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:50.920]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.400]
Hi, first time caller.

[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:52.900]
Uh-huh.

[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:57.180]
I just wanted to tell you that yet, I'm calling for the tickets on being on a step

[00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:57.500]
front.

[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:57.960]
Mm hmm.

[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:01.240]
But I also wanted to tell you that all women don't hate you.

[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.600]
I listen to you every morning.

[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.300]
Oh, my heart.

[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.940]
Poison hate me like poison.

[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:05.920]
I don't hate you.

[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.720]
All the women out there just don't advise me.

[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.420]
They don't get it.

[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.180]
They can't stand it.

[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:09.680]
I'm vulgar.

[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.040]
I'm just like your springer with all those.

[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.280]
Belief center.

[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.920]
They like that, but they can't stand me.

[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.720]
Now, I like you very much.

[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.520]
In fact, I take you at night for my husband because he's on duty.

[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.040]
So when he comes home, he can see you.

[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:21.680]
How do you like that?

[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.540]
And on top of that, I also want to thank you for sticking up for president.

[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.720]
Well, what's there to stick up?

[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.240]
I mean, this is a very.

[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.380]
I'm a woman's point of view.

[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:30.960]
Thank you.

[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:31.360]
OK.

[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.660]
Hold on.

[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.840]
She now anything to say, but after a such a job like that, why not?

[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.360]
OK, Dave County, our last call for Dave County.

[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.280]
They were picking up right where we left off last week.

[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.140]
I thought maybe they'd have the weekend to kind of melalot a little bit.

[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.700]
Maybe get a little good weed there over the weekend.

[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:46.820]
Get the fresh supply.

[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:47.480]
Something.

[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.820]
Same old crap.

[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.080]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.660]
God, what a, you know, something.

[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.140]
What if I didn't have these tickets today?

[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.340]
Is that a thought that's too horrible to even conjecture?

[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:06.220]
Seriously, that's a thought that even even I don't want to think about the possibility of that.

[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.100]
Here's a mobile and Tamarack.

[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:09.280]
Hello.

[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:10.840]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:11.440]
OK, sir.

[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.040]
Um, couple things.

[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.140]
Um, first of all, um, yesterday the game was awfully boring.

[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.700]
I actually went to public for a third quarter to buy dinner.

[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:21.080]
I mean, they had no offense.

[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:21.840]
None zero.

[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.240]
Zip it into the, they couldn't do anything with that ball.

[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.740]
And then late in the game, they get that one lucky drive, which happens at almost every game.

[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:28.980]
It's him that has done nothing all game.

[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:33.340]
The other team goes in that prevent defense to kind of lay back and they went down and scored one touchdown.

[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.520]
Like that's the claim to fame.

[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.040]
If you take that out of the statistics, it was a humiliation.

[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.940]
And these people don't want to deal with that.

[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.340]
Well, that was one of my sources.

[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.940]
It was the referees, you know, that was one of my points.

[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:43.740]
I went to the store.

[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.020]
Fontaine or came back and I really didn't miss anything.

[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.940]
Also on Friday, didn't get a chance to call in.

[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.760]
But I went to the 13th night game last week in the new arena.

[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.080]
Right.

[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.980]
Living camera left at 10 after 7.

[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.280]
Got their buys the drop of the box.

[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.220]
People with the traffic, where the construction is.

[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:03.440]
Had some real decent club seats with a nice, nice leathery back.

[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.660]
Those club seats are great.

[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.220]
And they're just like to do a comment on.

[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.760]
You get up, you're right at the back.

[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.580]
And you go up the escalator, you're right at your seat.

[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.540]
Not only that, usually when you go to a stadium, you feel real constricted like you can't move around.

[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.500]
Go up three rows, four rows and you can stand behind your section.

[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:19.840]
Right.

[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.240]
In just mingle, watch the game stand up.

[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.060]
It is incredible.

[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.360]
I don't have season tickets.

[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.340]
These I got from work, but it really makes you regret that you don't have them.

[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:30.660]
It's absolutely outstanding.

[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.540]
And I think they knew ahead of time how well week the team was going to be this year.

[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.980]
So I think there was a method to their madness.

[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.840]
They made it a place where he could mingle and go and buy a lot of the expensive overpriced food.

[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.000]
And you know, just wander around or most of the game because that's what we're going to be doing.

[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:43.680]
Right.

[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.860]
Well, if work comes to work and they really have a bad year this year, they can build another one

[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:47.840]
with maybe some better upgrades.

[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:48.400]
There you go.

[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.840]
Let's build another arena.

[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:50.360]
Come on.

[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.700]
We got a lot of land out there.

[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:52.900]
Can I get on the list there?

[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.020]
Sure.

[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:53.360]
Hang on.

[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.640]
OK, 10 55 and 5 60 WQ MLC those day lines are they still dead as a door nail?

[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.160]
Wow.

[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.400]
And we're giving away Niels prestigious seats right there right on one on one right almost at center rice for opening

[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.340]
not against Tampa Bay and the Panthers and these people still don't care.

[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.240]
Do they know in Dave County, a bunch of geeks.

[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.440]
Oh, it's a hockey game.

[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.140]
They don't care about that.

[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:13.640]
OK.

[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:19.780]
5 6 7 0 5 60 60 WQ MLC got hanged live from Shula State to from to the 6.

[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:24.420]
We got the Booster 6 to lay the clock and then Monday and football the Vikings of the Packers 8 o'clock tonight.

[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:30.660]
Open line and Broward all of day again 5 6 7 0 5 60, pound 5 60 on the AT&T line.

[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.240]
Here's a Hollywood.

[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:32.600]
Hello.

[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.640]
I go back to the old hockey league in 1950s.

[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:42.120]
Niels, the main thing is the politicians that don't they have a responsibility to roll with the constituents one.

[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.920]
It's 34% of the people say let's get this thing open.

[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.600]
Don't they have some.

[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.100]
Oh, wait, wait, why are you doing that to me?

[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.780]
Why are you putting a rim around the phone again?

[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.580]
Don't you remember what he did?

[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.380]
I'm already dying here this morning.

[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:54.980]
No, no, no.

[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:56.960]
What do you want?

[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.260]
Good morning.

[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.040]
The waiver draft, though, just out to exercising this morning.

[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.820]
The waiver draft at 11 o'clock this morning.

[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:04.160]
Yeah.

[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.840]
And I think there could be quite a bit of activity.

[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:10.260]
Why don't you call back and tell us some information when we get some info?

[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:10.840]
Wow.

[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.460]
You wanted to know what time the draft was.

[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.160]
No, I didn't want to know what time it was.

[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.620]
Some bimbo call that was sucking around for free tickets.

[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.900]
I didn't want to know what time the waiver draft was.

[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.240]
If I get the information.

[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:20.860]
I'm speaking to you right now.

[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.220]
You're going to blow my brains out and you're again.

[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:28.520]
This is what you get how you get repaid for all those meals of Ruth's Chris with another terminal call.

[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.700]
One day last week we had a permanent.

[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.320]
We had about a 15 minute segment where we had a few people talking to me.

[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:34.620]
Oh, it's time.

[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.260]
And then River calls up in the middle of it.

[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.220]
And it was like somebody dropped an H bomb.

[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.900]
Even the Japs never scattered like this audience did when you called last week.

[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:42.800]
You know what you need?

[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.660]
Oh, you know what you need a very important part.

[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.080]
You need a very important part.

[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.100]
What you need for a shot, the arm is a hockey show.

[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:49.300]
A preview.

[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.240]
Hello?

[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:53.380]
Oh.

[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.380]
We need to bring Charyon.

[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.540]
We need to talk about the Panthers and the Dewea Reams.

[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:57.900]
Oh.

[00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.600]
And I don't even know that.

[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.360]
This man is crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy man.

[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.760]
Hey, you want, hey, we had a lot of fun.

[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.880]
You must be planning on going on a long diet.

[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.020]
We had a lot of success on those hockey shows.

[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.400]
No, we have not.

[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.780]
No, we have not.

[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.820]
It's only the people calling and sucking around for free tickets that call those shows.

[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.360]
They don't know anything about hockey.

[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.120]
When are you going to get with it, Rimmer?

[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.820]
When are you going to wake up and sniff the dip?

[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.560]
That is the white hole you have come right here.

[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.040]
Rimmer, he had his tee head on yesterday.

[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.140]
I was good seeing Billy Lindsay naked there yesterday.

[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.340]
And I thought we had Ray Whitney there when it was on.

[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:33.640]
He sure did.

[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.360]
It's the past time you do one of those shows in the locker room.

[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.700]
Have Ray take his pose off.

[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.380]
That's what the public wants to see.

[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.040]
Will you listen?

[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:45.180]
I don't care about that.

[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.020]
Well, I do.

[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.840]
And the other thing we do is, you know, the difference between you and me is I know how to do a guide damn show.

[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.720]
You know how to put the audience into a coma.

[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.560]
And even I can't get these people away.

[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.540]
Give me a party.

[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.860]
I can't wait these bastards up.

[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.900]
I'm giving away my guide damn tickets for Friday.

[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.780]
I still can't get a call in date County.

[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.420]
How do you like that?

[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.100]
I'm out of business over here.

[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.160]
A hockey show would be the finishing blow.

[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.580]
You must be waiting in the woodwork to take over this time slot.

[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.500]
That was the thing.

[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.860]
Yeah, that's what you're doing.

[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.200]
Go ahead and try to get your shot at the end.

[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.240]
He'll make another deal with you, okay?

[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.200]
Go shake his hand.

[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:20.440]
Greg Reed.

[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.480]
He'll make another deal and put you on here for 50 bucks a week.

[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.740]
Not a question if it's a matter of luck.

[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.180]
You have a question of when this call is going to end.

[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.200]
Call me back when we get some information.

[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.980]
I'll tell him to get a gulter and a please hockey show.

[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.080]
Get out of here.

[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.700]
One thing we can say about those hockey shows with Rimmer.

[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.500]
They stunk.

[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.500]
We have two open lines in date.

[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.640]
What is the story the last two or three weeks?

[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.480]
I mean, we were having a problem there for about what?

[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.240]
The last nine months since I've been on this station.

[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.100]
But now the last couple of weeks date County is like totally.

[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.920]
It's like they're in war with us now.

[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:01.920]
In Kendall and Miami and Coconut Grove and where it was South Miami.

[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.500]
All over the date County, they're in war with this show.

[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.740]
They got nothing to say about anything.

[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.700]
They don't want no tickets.

[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.760]
They don't care about Monica.

[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.180]
They don't care about the guy in the Impulse.

[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.500]
They don't care about the dolphins.

[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.840]
They don't care about anything.

[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:19.740]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.900]
This is unbelievable.

[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.220]
Like I said a little while ago, if I didn't want to give my tickets away today,

[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.740]
I'd already be halfway home.

[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.820]
I'd already be on a road going home.

[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:29.000]
Guaranteed.

[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.420]
And then this crazy man calls up here.

[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.060]
Oh, got to do another hockey show.

[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.160]
I got news for you.

[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:38.340]
The chances of my ever doing another hockey show on a scale of minus infinity.

[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.860]
You're out of your mind, Rimmer.

[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.480]
You're a killer.

[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.080]
A hockey show.

[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.180]
So talk to the 10 hockey fans we got out there.

[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.280]
Nine of whom are in the line, forming at the mouth waiting for free tickets.

[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.460]
That's the only reason we ever got calls on O-shows.

[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:56.920]
Here's Sunrise. Hello.

[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:57.960]
Morning, Neil.

[00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:58.480]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.060]
I just want to say a couple of things.

[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.120]
One, I am a jet fan.

[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:02.060]
And to all the fans.

[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.060]
Look, congratulations, sir.

[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:03.580]
Great job.

[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:04.480]
Thank you very much.

[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.320]
I have to say we're that great, but the dolphins stung.

[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.760]
I've just listened to all the dolphins fans both about how they're going to kick our butt this weekend.

[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.960]
I'm just glad I can finally brush that off and stand on.

[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.700]
I get to listen to a pitch and mow.

[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.220]
Yeah.

[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:19.920]
And Bill, you can win and make excuses about how the officials stole the game from them

[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.200]
as if they had any offense.

[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:24.540]
It was the officials where the officials out there playing defense for the jets.

[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.340]
I don't think so.

[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.780]
No, I think there are bad calls on both sides of the ball.

[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.100]
Right.

[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.080]
Regardless, you know, a game is a game.

[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.780]
Don't take it so seriously, but don't always talk down about everybody.

[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:33.380]
It's really rude.

[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.140]
But that's typical of the dolphin fans, though.

[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:36.460]
Talk a big game.

[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.440]
You know, they win two or three games.

[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.420]
And this goes on every year.

[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.640]
It happens every single season.

[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.140]
They win the first two or three games.

[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.520]
Then they start talking trash.

[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.760]
They start talking super bowl.

[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.360]
And then they start coming back to worth after you realize that they basically meet nobody anyway.

[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.000]
Well, I went to the game last year.

[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.860]
I'll never go to another dolphin game.

[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.160]
They're absolute morons.

[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.560]
They get drawn out of their mind.

[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.600]
They don't know what they're doing.

[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.480]
Well, 25 of the jets fans don't do that.

[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.840]
Anyway, before I go, I have one request.

[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:02.880]
If I may, could you please play Cowboy Dick?

[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:03.500]
Okay.

[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:04.760]
And can I get on the rim?

[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:05.580]
Okay, hold on.

[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.520]
Yeah, thank God that the jet fans don't do that.

[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.000]
They don't, they just throw snowballs.

[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.720]
They throw iceballs and try to kill guys.

[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.860]
Was that the jet or the, well, whoever the hell it was, who was in New York?

[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.280]
Here's a mobile in Oakland Park.

[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:18.580]
Hello.

[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:19.580]
Hello.

[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.620]
You know, you need to let somebody have to take it after hearing rims.

[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.120]
Oh, can you believe that?

[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.660]
Can you just, do you know the torture that you just put us through?

[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:30.600]
I can't know what it is.

[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.380]
He's made the dish show in the last week.

[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.800]
Can you know something I can honestly say about both of those calls?

[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.420]
They've done.

[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.280]
Oh, my God.

[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.120]
I thought he had some news for us.

[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.980]
You know, I don't mind if he calls with some news because the organization itself doesn't

[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.740]
give us any info.

[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.300]
And we're sure not going to get that any from over on Sheridan Street.

[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.020]
They're not going to tell us what the hell is going on.

[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.740]
So I thought maybe he had some news on a waiver draft today.

[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.260]
Instead, he's telling me what time it is, which is right now.

[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:58.140]
Now, would you start to have some kind of talent in order for them to, you know, get compensation for what they pay?

[00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:58.780]
No.

[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:00.200]
Oh.

[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.140]
Do I have a job?

[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.640]
Yeah, anytime.

[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:03.260]
You're hired.

[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.700]
You've heard the punks we got on the station already.

[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.280]
Something better than most of them.

[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:11.240]
I just also want to tell you I'm so happy to stop at the loss because there's a stop there.

[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.620]
You can energize them in your big mouth.

[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.840]
And people come up with their big running game.

[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:17.460]
Oh, they got a running game.

[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:18.080]
Do they have one?

[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:18.300]
No.

[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.040]
Not in the least.

[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:25.200]
Someone with a big stupid name, so the defensive line, they come on and get rid of people.

[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.800]
It's a, it's a, it's a, I love what you do in the health.

[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:29.360]
Keep it up.

[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:30.800]
And you take care of it.

[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:31.720]
And back to you.

[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:32.360]
Thank you.

[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:36.520]
Yeah, it's going to be a ugly year because there's so many ugly teams, so many bad teams.

[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.060]
They swill what I saw yesterday.

[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:43.600]
And of course, San Francisco, wanting to loosen the Buffalo 49ers with 65,000 yards in penalties.

[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.480]
And then Buffalo nearly blown a 20, three, nothing lead.

[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:47.960]
But that's what you got red.

[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:48.720]
That's what you wanted.

[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:49.760]
I guess you wanted parity.

[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.480]
You wanted all the teams to be crap except Denver.

[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.760]
And look who the hell they were playing anyway.

[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.500]
Well, can you, can you answer me one thing?

[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.840]
What is that loud, unbelievable noise?

[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:05.600]
Trade trigger or blower or something like that?

[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:09.680]
This place is unbelievable.

[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:15.400]
I mean, those people in the condos across the way, which is certainly maybe a hundred yards from here.

[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:20.300]
If those people, you can smell it in here and believe me, it's not very appetizing either.

[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.360]
We got walls like paper in this joint, like paper mache.

[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:25.480]
Okay.

[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.680]
Where we going? Here's the whole sound.

[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:31.160]
Hello?

[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:32.940]
Neil, guess who?

[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:33.720]
Yes, I am.

[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.160]
Yeah, what a, what a client's act before that, huh?

[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.020]
What, rumor?

[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:38.320]
Oh.

[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.100]
They stuck.

[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.780]
Hey, I heard a comment earlier about that.

[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:46.080]
If I was stupid enough to let him do it, he would destroy my career that, man.

[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.320]
He would put me out of business.

[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:48.820]
Got into a hockey show.

[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:49.760]
Hit the who?

[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.060]
Who that would be talking to?

[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.440]
There's nobody who wants to talk hockey.

[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.360]
Yeah, I heard him.

[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.080]
He's very, very less about it.

[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.180]
They know nothing about it.

[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.080]
He's running his career.

[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.160]
He's trying to kill everybody else.

[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:57.720]
Right, exactly.

[00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.300]
He can't get on the air, so he's trying to siphon off of this show.

[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:01.280]
Yeah, I like that comment.

[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.460]
Someone said Jimmy Johnson looked like a bowling ball with air.

[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.000]
I love, no, a bowling ball with arms.

[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:05.640]
Oh, okay.

[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:06.460]
And that's his good.

[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.040]
And bad here.

[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.400]
Hey, I was up in Toronto recently.

[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:11.080]
Yeah?

[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.240]
That's a great area.

[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:12.880]
Yes, it is.

[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:16.060]
Yeah, I was up in the area called the beaches up there along the lakefront.

[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.220]
But I'm going to be going back.

[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:18.940]
Any suggestions?

[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:20.940]
Any suggestions for one?

[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.340]
I have a good time up there.

[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:26.500]
Yeah, walk out on Young Street or church, so you'll have a good time.

[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.500]
Hey, better than Miami.

[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:27.940]
Uh-huh.

[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.460]
I haven't been a hockey fan.

[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:31.300]
I haven't been to a game.

[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:31.880]
I'd love an opportunity to go on.

[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:32.600]
Okay, hold on.

[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:34.900]
I'm putting everybody on the list.

[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:38.160]
Okay, if that's what it takes today, because I can see we're picking up all.

[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.600]
Boy, we got momentum in this place.

[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:39.820]
No.

[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:44.000]
We got to center one promotion, which we're working feverishly to try to make that a big success this year,

[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:48.060]
to make up for last year, with Greg Reed and everybody around here screwed us big time.

[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:51.740]
And in the meantime, where it's kind of like promotion in a closet.

[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.380]
That's the way I feel.

[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:57.840]
And in fact, I feel like the whole, this whole place is like, it's like radio station in a closet.

[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.620]
The studio is like in a broom closet.

[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.900]
The TV show is definitely in the closet.

[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.780]
That's going out soon anyway, so don't worry about that.

[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.060]
Every day we get another story on that thing, you know?

[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:09.720]
And do they ever talk to me at all?

[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:09.840]
No.

[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.040]
And Maddie and Vicki and Sticky are suddenly send a lackey to send Rob Jr. over here.

[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.980]
And he's about to be, but about any talks, different story every day.

[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.700]
Every time I see him, he gives me a different story.

[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.520]
Oh, it's going off.

[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.600]
Well, it's going in hiatus.

[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:23.760]
It might come back as an hour.

[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.620]
It might never come back.

[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.140]
It's coming back, right?

[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.380]
So is George Washington.

[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.080]
He's coming back.

[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.980]
I'll tell you one good thing about that TV show.

[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.500]
They sure have given us a real good shot at it.

[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.800]
They really did justice to this show.

[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.260]
And they sure have helped to hell out of these, this audience here.

[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:46.860]
In fact, the longer the TV show was on, every day the radio audience is dwindling.

[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.940]
They take one look at that asshole with the Yamagon TV.

[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.520]
Oh, my God, we're not listening to that anymore.

[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:52.980]
They're running away from this joint.

[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:54.900]
And I don't blame them.

[00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:57.620]
They're going to be trimming these f-ing trees out here.

[00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.520]
I don't care where he is.

[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.500]
It's like every day now we got something new.

[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.040]
If they're not hammering and drilling upstairs, which we don't mind so much,

[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.640]
because at least we know they're building the new studios.

[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:09.920]
But every day we got sirens.

[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.860]
We got drilling and it sounds like the guy's inside the building.

[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:16.300]
If you could be sitting in here and here, well, I must say if he's over there,

[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:16.920]
it must be that loud.

[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:17.560]
Sure.

[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:24.260]
When you stop trimming the goddamn trees, we're trying to do an f-ing radio show you jacket.

[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:24.980]
Oh, he can't hear me.

[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.280]
It's 11 after 11.

[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.220]
Yeah, let's get Chico Mackie and Dennis Hall on the phone.

[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:31.700]
There you go.

[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.040]
Chico Ration.

[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:33.580]

[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:34.640]
Oh.

[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:36.780]
He's a killer.

[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:37.500]
I'm telling you, man.

[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.540]
You think OJ was bad?

[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.140]
Here's Miami.

[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:40.580]
Hello.

[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.040]
God, Neil.

[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.180]
OJ only killed two people.

[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.480]
This guy's killing my whole audience.

[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:45.980]
He's a trip.

[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:46.740]
He is.

[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:47.700]
I'm Linda.

[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:51.520]
The Jets looked really good yesterday, but Jets fans still suck.

[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.060]
Yeah, I wouldn't disagree with that.

[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:53.400]
Okay.

[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.720]
Most of them.

[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.480]
There was something I caught on the game while I was watching.

[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.880]
Now let me ask you, was it the Jets fans or the Jets fans that were throwing the snowballs

[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.360]
in the charger game a couple of years ago?

[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.140]
And hitting guys in the head, remember that?

[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.340]
I remember the answer.

[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.460]
Yeah, I was living up there.

[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.000]
I actually think it was Jets fans.

[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.760]
But it was a real...

[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:15.220]
I remember Jets fans at halftime used to love to get on the spiral thing that they drive the trucks on,

[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:18.920]
the stairway, these, just like the lean over and spit on people.

[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.420]
That's classy.

[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:21.660]
That's what I remember the whole thing.

[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:22.120]
There you go.

[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.720]
But I caught something on the game while I was watching.

[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.020]
I don't know if you thought it.

[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.720]
I have to listen into the game.

[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.840]
And all of a sudden I heard a voice go, Neil.

[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.060]
And I was waiting to hear God after it, but what it went was Neil.

[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:36.960]
Did you have your chunky soup?

[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:38.120]
Oh yeah, that's right.

[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:38.840]
That's a great spot.

[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:41.000]
You know how come Red G-Wine in out there no more, huh?

[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.380]
But that's a...

[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:44.600]
I thought that was poetic justice.

[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:46.160]
They replaced Red G-Wine with...

[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:46.840]
Yeah, it was good.

[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:48.040]
I know it's chunky soup spots.

[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:48.600]
Absolutely.

[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:49.440]
That was cute.

[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.080]
Absolutely.

[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.180]
You got to get that for the website or something, that clip.

[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:53.640]
Right.

[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.780]
I'd love to get on the list, but can I say something first?

[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:56.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.740]
Jim and Karen, you're both hockey-loving douchebags.

[00:50:58.980 --> 00:50:59.700]
Okay, how about...

[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:01.020]
Now let me ask you this...

[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:01.800]
Let me have you vote.

[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:03.360]
Do you want any hockey shows with Rimmer?

[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:04.320]
No.

[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.260]
Okay, hold on.

[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:08.700]
No.

[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.560]
When he said that, I mean, wasn't bad enough that he called.

[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:16.480]
I mean, I'm having another, you know, death-defying day here again, the, what, the fifth and a row.

[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:23.060]
But when he called, and I thought for sure he must have some news, some information.

[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.600]
We just made a deal.

[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.980]
We got Pavel Bore from the Vancouver Connux.

[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.000]
We got Trevor Lyndon from the islanders.

[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.580]
We got that we made the Felix Potva and deal with Leafs.

[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:32.460]
We did something.

[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.800]
Did he have anything to enlighten us or we lose it, eh?

[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:37.060]
No.

[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:42.920]
I mean, when something happens, please call us back and let me know, because I'm in the dark here.

[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.400]
We have no idea what's going on.

[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:49.460]
But other than that, just calling to what, to talk about doing a hockey show,

[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:54.720]
is there one person in this audience that would ever like to hear another one of those Rimmer hockey shows on this program?

[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.040]
No.

[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:55.820]
Okay, thank you.

[00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:59.500]
In fact, I'd say to what they would, they would even rather hear...

[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.060]
Then here another one of those hockey shows.

[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.120]
You're right to the goddamn phone.

[00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:09.220]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60 and 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.680]
Are pull questions today.

[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.540]
Any more hockey shows with Rimmer?

[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:12.780]
No.

[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.840]
Here's a mobile in Miami Beach.

[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:16.100]
Hello.

[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:17.040]
Meal.

[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:17.580]
Yes, sir.

[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:18.680]
Yeah, how you doing?

[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:25.500]
Watching us in the Doppengaine, the main reason I think the Doppengaine is off is just because the bus will push those hot cores in the Johnson.

[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.480]
That's the bottom line.

[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.320]
You know, well, more prepared in those.

[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.640]
They were ready for the swing passes.

[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.540]
They're corner backs behind the faces.

[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.420]
They're just more prepared.

[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:35.560]
I think you did a good job.

[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:39.820]
I mean, when Vinny Testy-Burdy makes you look bad, then you know you've got to, you've got to have problems.

[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:41.160]
There's a lot of trouble.

[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.840]
I thought there would be okay, but I have to sing up their names.

[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:44.900]
They have no chance.

[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:46.800]
I agree with you.

[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:49.300]
I mean, they're defecting the first three games, expect that.

[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.840]
They're in their defenses just like that.

[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:53.400]
But offensively, man, they suck.

[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.400]
This is not a team.

[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.740]
We're missing two that bad, but we aren't the people.

[00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:57.360]
I have to game.

[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.400]
That's right. When you keep giving them all back, that's right.

[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:00.400]
You got it.

[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.120]
All right, dude. How'd I say?

[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:02.960]
And back to you.

[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.440]
Well, there's a guy that's honest about it.

[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:07.020]
The Doppeng Stalk yesterday.

[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.960]
In fact, it isn't that what Rumors said just before I finally cut him off.

[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.720]
So, how'd you like that Doppengaine yesterday?

[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:12.500]
They stopped.

[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.120]
We have an open line of dig, yeah.

[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:15.260]
And he went on.

[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:15.660]
That's it.

[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:16.860]
Puts it up real good, that rumor.

[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.040]
Wayne owns the Doppengaine too, but he don't mind.

[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:20.360]
He told it right away it was.

[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:20.940]
They stopped.

[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.260]
Those Panthers do last year.

[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:23.240]
There you go.

[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:25.760]
How they doing tapas there, they know when they blew that three nothing lead.

[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:26.240]
They stopped.

[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.800]
Now we're pushing him up a little bit.

[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.940]
We have an open line in Dave.

[00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:33.580]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, and 05, 60.

[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.100]
How about those Marlins this season?

[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.240]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:37.000]
Woo!

[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.820]
He's really pushing up big time.

[00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:42.040]
How about Wayne and his buddies?

[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:42.640]
They stopped.

[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.220]
Here's a mobile and sunrise.

[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:44.540]
Hello.

[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:47.240]
Who knew?

[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:47.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:48.900]
You suck.

[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.660]
Okay, thank you so much.

[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.780]
We have an open line in Dave wanted.

[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:56.600]
Broward, this guy waited on his mobile phone for like 15 minutes to blurt it out.

[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:57.080]
Yeah, I do.

[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:57.980]
And what about a jealous?

[00:53:59.060 --> 00:53:59.740]
Probably is.

[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:01.160]
Here's Miami.

[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:01.520]
Hello.

[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:02.380]
Hello.

[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.400]
I think you guys need to give the dolphins more credit.

[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:10.940]
They're a bunch of crap assholes, but anyway, they're playing their ass off.

[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:12.280]
We have, okay, great.

[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:16.700]
We have an open line in the Broward one in day two in day five six seven oh five sixty

[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:18.920]
five five sixty on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:20.540]
Here's a mobile and key west.

[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:20.800]
Hello.

[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.760]
There was a typical sports off-road sports fan.

[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:24.180]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.320]
On the young kidboard chicken boy.

[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:27.380]
Yeah.

[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:31.660]
I'm calling on from the Dan of Mount Breeder, the trailer tragic in the Keys.

[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.260]
One thing I have to say being away and being down.

[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.820]
Don't start singing any Jimmy Buffett songs.

[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:37.300]
Are you here at dial tone real fast?

[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.740]
No, I don't care about that.

[00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:44.560]
I've been really glad not to watch any of the news about the Eclinton's handle.

[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:47.140]
For the time that I've been here, it's been so playful.

[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:48.100]
Yeah.

[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.000]
And I'm so glad not to hear about that.

[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.320]
Well, the Dow is down 138 points and the Nasdaq is down about 75 million so far today.

[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:57.040]
Meanwhile, they got this house judiciary committee debate going on here.

[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.680]
And they're all, it's all strictly political.

[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:00.780]
It's all a bunch of bull crap.

[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.120]
And this is what the whole government now is tied up with.

[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:05.660]
And the meantime, the world can wear into a world of depression.

[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.000]
But they can't be bothered with that.

[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:12.220]
The hilarious thing about it is that I heard I think one of those talking ahead say that,

[00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:15.780]
well, you know, we want to do what's best for the American people.

[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:16.860]
Yeah, right.

[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:17.380]
Oh, yeah.

[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:21.060]
And then that little Ross Piro, he said they dragged him out of the closet again.

[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.320]
And he's on there talking just absolute garbage.

[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.520]
Clinton's on cocaine.

[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:25.400]
He's doing drugs.

[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:28.280]
He's going to start wars over this to divert the attention of the father.

[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:32.940]
This little guy, he ought to be, he ought to be taken and put on death row with Larry King the two of them together.

[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.600]
They had to find a twin cedar for the two of them and they're given the juice.

[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.820]
In fact, a triple cedar put the juice right in between the two of them.

[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:40.360]
Yeah, but he's hilarious. That's the reason why.

[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.760]
Maybe just put Ross Piro in the juice is laugh.

[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.460]
I let him laugh.

[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:45.260]
Just lick him.

[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:45.740]
There you go.

[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.160]
Thanks a lot, Chuck.

[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.160]
How's Chuck Meyer doing? Anybody hear about the Chuck?

[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:49.540]
No.

[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.020]
How's that morning show doing in Cleveland?

[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:51.300]
No.

[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:53.100]
Okay, let's move right along.

[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.460]
Okay, I'm still trying to recover from that rimmer phone call.

[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.000]
I can't believe it.

[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.200]
I think the two of you are conspiring.

[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:03.300]
I think there's a bloodless coup just like the Republicans are trying to take over the whole goddamn government.

[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:07.520]
I think George and Rimmer are working together conspiring to take over the whole goddamn show.

[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:08.620]
That's right.

[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:13.540]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:13.840]
Hello.

[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:14.820]
New York.

[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:15.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:17.060]
Hello.

[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:17.680]
Speak to me.

[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:17.880]
Yes.

[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:18.320]
Yeah.

[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:30.320]
I think this Monica Wednesday's BS is just great for the nation because it's going to show that what idiots they have in Washington to the whole world.

[00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:31.220]
Okay, thank you.

[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:36.400]
We have an open line in date one and Broward 56670560.560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:41.320]
Our center one total is, well, we don't know about the total is 13,350.

[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.900]
But if that of course includes the 10 grand, I put in to kick it off.

[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.580]
Is there any reason why you mentioned that a lot?

[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:46.940]
Uh-huh.

[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:47.520]
Sure there is.

[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.600]
Because then I try to like inspire other people to get with the program.

[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:51.340]
That's the idea.

[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:56.760]
So we did $2,240 downstairs at border Saturday, $1,100 on the old stuff and the t-shirts upstairs.

[00:56:57.060 --> 00:57:00.140]
So that's not too bad, 3,350 or thereabouts, whatever you just said.

[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:11.440]
Not great, but the real key will be which we're not going to find out till next Monday I find out now because there hasn't been a system put in place to find out what the other port is, all the other seven stores that we're doing.

[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:20.180]
And of course tomorrow night at pizza lots are we going to have a magnificent turnout tomorrow night between 6 and 8 o'clock at the pizza lot 35, 14 South University drive in Davie where the food is great.

[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:21.220]
We always have a great time.

[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:22.300]
We've damn well better.

[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:24.220]
Or I'm really going to be psychotic.

[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:27.760]
I'm going to do something rash like coming on Wednesday if we don't have a great turnout tomorrow.

[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:39.200]
Man, these people are getting air be here they get tougher and tougher you got to poke them you got to proud of me got to stick them in the rectum you got to do everything in their power because they're getting their dying over here.

[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:44.000]
Just like this bit I just played the rickland up like a goddamn prune lot more surface though.

[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.060]
Here's Miami hello.

[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.700]
Yeah, yes sir.

[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.600]
Yes, I got a question about the new Broward arena man.

[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:52.160]
Yes, what the hell's up with that place?

[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:56.700]
I'm going to see you and take a holder for the uh, what do you mean what the hell is up with that place?

[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:57.380]
What does that mean?

[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.340]
I went over there to the uh, the Bruins game preseason.

[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:01.860]
And my seat was busted.

[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:04.620]
I talked to about 10 other people that night the same thing happened to them.

[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.380]
Oh yeah, 10 other people their seat was busted.

[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:11.860]
Are you talking about the ones who are sitting behind the goal where those uh, they don't have the portable seats?

[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:12.280]
Yeah.

[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:12.920]
Yeah.

[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.320]
Well, I'll get you out of luck.

[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.560]
Okay, we have an open line in day five six seven oh five six these.

[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.540]
See if you would have been a big shot like me, you would have gone over there talk this day.

[00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:22.420]
And you feel they would have taken good care of you.

[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:25.480]
And you'd be wanting up sitting in one oh one right on the aisle there.

[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:29.340]
So you don't have to worry about those tiny little narrow seats that everybody else is going to get pinched and uh,

[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.740]
get a squeezed back home for the year is out.

[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:35.420]
You'd be sitting out there just in real life's comfort and luxury hanging right out of the aisle.

[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:37.160]
There were lots of leg room that have a good time.

[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:38.580]
So I guess you lose pal.

[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:40.160]
We can't all win a new arena.

[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:43.080]
Not everybody can sit in the great seat no matter what arena it is.

[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:46.100]
But they got to do something about those goal lights.

[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:46.860]
I'm telling you.

[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:53.520]
In fact, what the hell they hit on an older, they were showing a playoff game the flyers and the sabers on class spitting lights that go around in the whole, you know,

[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.220]
like a big thing like a big deal.

[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:57.080]
Even don't need to buy the goddamn lights.

[00:58:58.760 --> 00:58:59.880]
Here's a mobile and bokeh.

[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:00.100]
Hello.

[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:01.320]
Hello.

[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:02.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.240]
Neil, two comments.

[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:07.180]
One on the dolphin game and one on Henry in the Marlin.

[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:12.100]
These guys that are on in the morning, they're such homers.

[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.680]
I argued with them all last week.

[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.200]
Miami had no shot within the jet team.

[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:17.460]
I went so far to say.

[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:18.820]
Well, how do you know they had no shot?

[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.620]
I mean, how can I, that's a ridiculous statement.

[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.420]
How could I know that?

[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:24.560]
Well, I'll tell you the way the two teams had played up until yesterday.

[00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:26.220]
How could anybody say they had no shot?

[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:30.740]
I'm going to tell you why I felt that way and what I did about it.

[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:36.780]
I felt that they said the quality of teams that they had played in their first three games.

[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:38.800]
And they showed zero offense.

[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:43.900]
And they also showed play three teams that had zero offense.

[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:44.220]
Yeah.

[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:49.600]
And I just figured that the dolphins were going to be lucky if they scored ten points in the game.

[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:52.520]
I even went so far as made five.

[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:52.980]
I mean, five.

[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:59.200]
I put it in ten points and said for that brilliant play that Jimmy Johnson called going for the two-pointer there on the direct snap to Rolindo Mari.

[00:59:59.500 --> 00:59:59.920]
Right.

[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:00.640]
No, no, no.

[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.500]
Not either.

[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:10.020]
I bet the game I made five separate dinner bets for four with five of my friends that if the Jets scored 17 points in the game that they cover the spread.

[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:10.420]
Right.

[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:15.200]
Now, Mr. Henry, I think Mr. Heising about it got real serious.

[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:22.120]
And do something with Mr. Henry before because of the volatility of the.

[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.220]
The really.

[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:23.480]

[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.900]
The value of the head.

[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:25.840]
Yeah.

[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.100]
He better do something.

[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.340]
Are you sure you're not going to pay for it?

[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:28.600]
Okay.

[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.340]
Mr. Henry Wallace, what he said.

[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.360]
Are you talking about Phil Henry?

[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.400]
Are you, yeah, positive.

[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:36.440]
Hey, listen, all that money you won from your friends in a game yesterday, go out and buy some teeth.

[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:42.240]
We have an open line and date one and broard five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t wireless line.

[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:43.720]
Hey, it's American.

[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.720]
I don't express these people to be able to express the expected express whatever I said.

[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:49.060]
They can't speak.

[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:50.400]
Here's Miami.

[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:50.800]
Hello.

[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:51.880]
Neil.

[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:52.420]
Yes, sir.

[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.240]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:53.680]
Okay.

[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.280]
Listen, I was wondering, you know, I was cheering a good interview with a last night.

[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.580]
I was wondering why you never do anything important like Art Bell.

[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:01.920]
Oh, yeah, Art Bell.

[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.140]
No talk about space for that.

[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:03.400]
Yeah.

[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:04.480]
Okay.

[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.740]
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed the Art Bell.

[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:09.400]
So maybe you can put up the, maybe you can put up the bond to get him out of jail next time.

[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.120]
We put one of those bogus people on and scares the whole of the world.

[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.480]
Hey, there's a buddy, Sal fell comb with our sole water.

[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:15.260]
Thank you, Sal.

[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:16.780]
Great.

[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:17.560]
I'll look at that.

[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:18.720]
Sal is going in, come on.

[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.820]
He's going in a beard and a mustache.

[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.320]
He must have the boys must be after him.

[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:27.420]
Okay, we have two open lines and date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t wireless line.

[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.440]
Here's a mobile and Helen Dale.

[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:29.740]
Hello.

[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.740]
Mobile and Helen Dale.

[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.580]
Hello, Neil.

[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:34.160]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.300]
How you doing, Stanley?

[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:35.580]

[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.300]
I'd like to talk to you about that newer.

[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:37.960]
Thanks, Sal.

[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:38.380]
Yes.

[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.400]
At New Arena, we sat up there.

[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.520]
Saturday night for the Dion show.

[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:42.880]
Right.

[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.760]
And we sat in a Mezzanine.

[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.040]
We needed oxygen tanks.

[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:47.780]
It was so high up.

[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.080]
You couldn't see from up there.

[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.300]
The acoustics were bad.

[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.340]
Well, you know, it's interesting because I wasn't there either.

[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:53.520]
So lean Dion around and jump.

[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.740]
But I read in the newspapers, both papers over the weekend.

[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.040]
Air V article that said the acoustics were great.

[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:58.980]
And it was very comfortable.

[01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:59.980]
Everybody had a good time.

[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.060]
So go rotten, Helen Dale.

[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:01.360]
Okay.

[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:02.120]
Get out of here.

[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.240]
Complaints, complaints, complaints.

[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.860]
All these people know how to do is bitch and bellyache.

[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:07.580]
That's their whole deal.

[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:07.940]
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.

[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.980]
I can't you be more positive like me.

[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:10.980]
Jesus.

[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.260]
Felly, it can bitch and moan and groan.

[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.100]
I mean, I don't know.

[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.080]
The newspapers don't have any asked to grind.

[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.480]
They don't get their press passes.

[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:22.480]
But I read all kinds of articles about the Celine Dion concert.

[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:25.580]
The Elton John concert said everybody with the acoustics were sensational.

[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.680]
The place was great.

[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:28.540]
It was palatial.

[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.740]
People had a wonderful time.

[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.420]
They loved the new arena.

[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:32.780]
And what do we get?

[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:34.620]
We get the sour push.

[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.500]
That's what we get.

[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:36.960]
We get the grizzled old fart.

[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.060]
The wrinkled up old fart from Helen Dale.

[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.880]
And you know something that will teach you to go see Celine Dion anyway.

[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:44.160]
And off there you go.

[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:45.600]
Payback is a bitch.

[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.240]
I wonder if they paint her in loonies or tunies.

[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.080]
We have an open line indeed.

[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:51.620]
Out, Florida.

[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.100]
If we got any visitors down here.

[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.560]
If we have any of the people visiting coming down for the season

[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.320]
because it's dark, cool, and off a little bit up north.

[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.460]
Welcome back to a real miserable hostel, nasty place where they all hate you.

[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:02.180]
They hate each other.

[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.040]
They hate themselves.

[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.040]
They hate everything down here.

[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.160]
They hate their consistent.

[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.280]
Why?

[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:10.660]
22, something you won't hate.

[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.320]
That's been injurious.

[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:11.640]
But taste.

[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.560]
I mean, if you want to go out there and eat plain vanilla ice cream,

[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.880]
one of those off brands, or if you want to eat the stuff that comes in those big tubs,

[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.860]
which I don't want to mention the name on here,

[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160]
you can go ahead and eat that crap.

[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.120]
That means you got no taste.

[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.900]
But if you love great ice cream,

[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:24.500]
A.L.

[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:26.140]
Lick it and stick it.

[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.560]
Coming to Lick Alodean this fall,

[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:32.880]
Ellen DeGeneres, Katie Lang, and Melissa Eppridge in

[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.240]
the

[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.600]
Red Bull

[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:47.980]
Red Bull

[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.300]
Red Bull

[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:19.920]
okay and look at your show ma'am yeah anyway this is I was listening to your show

[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.580]
last Wednesday and you know Kipper yeah and I got it

[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:29.280]
you had me laughing all that I was working I'm Jewish myself and I ate I drank I

[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.320]
did everything I want to know if you saw anybody was chicken on your head and

[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:35.580]
their head oh yeah so 17 old Jews in hell and they'll with chickens on their

[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:38.520]
head really it wasn't fair I'm Kipper they were running out of a pumper next

[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.900]
they were stealing them yeah what do you mean by that by that expression by

[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:47.360]
that thing by chicken by what expression by saying you saw them with chicken

[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:51.460]
on hand do you mean like a beanie I am a car no chickens like real live chickens

[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:54.380]
they old orthodox believe that if you put a chicken on your head on your

[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:58.340]
Kipper that your sins will drain out of your body into the chicken so it's

[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:01.920]
a thing it's crazy that people will starve themselves and go through all that

[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:07.280]
BS going sitting in trouble with your first we are going to super chauffeur and

[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:11.020]

[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:15.400]
open line at date five six seven oh five sixty and prom five sixty on the 18t

[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:18.740]
wireless line maybe that's where we like kind of lost contact with the audience

[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:21.960]
maybe is a maybe between George Riffin religion there which I think is very

[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:26.500]
blasphemous and then me attacking at the crap that barbaric archaic garbage on

[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:31.420]
your Kipper you know what too bad do we care no of course not speaking of that

[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:36.340]
that's a great segue cardinals beatification draws fire throughout his

[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:39.500]
papacy Pope John Paul the second is spoken earnestly of a Roman Catholic

[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:43.900]
churches desire to improve its relationship with the Jewish world and to

[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.700]
begin a reconciliation with the Eastern Orthodox churches but this week he's

[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:51.920]
making a controversial pilgrimage to Croatia that threatens to damage both of

[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:57.420]
those causes today in the shrine village of Maurizia Bistrica the

[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:00.960]
popus to celebrate mass to beautify this is yesterday to be identified

[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.000]
cardinal L. Azuzia Zizia Stepanak a man closely identified well how would you

[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.040]
pronounce it ALO's J. Z. I. J. E. those slabs slabs a man closely identified

[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.460]
with the prongaatsy Pupil regime in Croatia that murdered hundreds of

[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:19.200]
thousands of Serbs and Jews how do you like that in the Catholic Church be

[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:24.140]
attification is the first step towards St. Hood the Pope has described Stepanak as

[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:28.120]
the bulwark of the church among the quotes who resisted the yoke of communism in

[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:32.740]
the name of human rights and Christian dignity after World War II Stepanak a

[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:36.300]
archbishop of Zagreb became internationally known as a vehement opponent of

[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:40.500]
Tito's communist regime in Yugoslavia which in 1946 put him on trial and

[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.780]
convicted him of treason and collaboration he spent five years in prison and

[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:47.160]
the rest of his life under house arrest in the small village of Krasak his

[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:51.660]
birthplace died in 1960 much beloved by Catholic quotes for his simple

[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:55.380]
piety he also became an enduring symbol of Croatian nationalism that was

[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:59.640]
revived during the violent break of of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s but it is

[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:03.040]
Stepanak's record during the Nazi era that troubles Jewish organizations and

[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.180]
the Orthodox Church historians say Stepanak openly celebrated the pronazi

[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:12.340]
Yustashabru regime that came to power in Croatia 1941 and made little protest

[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:17.660]
while Yustashy murdered 30,000 Jews and perhaps 350,000 Serbs with a

[01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:22.320]
ferocity that startled even the Nazis even the Nazis were saying oh my god

[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:26.420]
Jesus in Croatia you could draw a straight line between the behavior of the

[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:29.740]
government and the influence of the church said Rabbi Abraham Cooper assistant

[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:32.820]
Dean of Salman Vizenthal Center in Los Angeles an organization that

[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:37.480]
documents the activities of Nazi war criminals and their collaborators so once

[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:41.080]
again the church is celebrating and they're gonna make a mistake sooner later

[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:45.820]
probably sooner because they never met a Nazi they didn't like we have an

[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:50.120]
open line and date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T line

[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:54.840]

[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.100]
looking for other things they're kind of like looking around they're going on

little fishing expedition and dragging out as long as they can for fun and

Haitians are so on the ball I saw them real tight yeah in the baseballs too

don't know where were you at either one of the concerts over the weekend no I wasn't in concert

[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:17.840]

[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:25.820]
valet there's no valet parking oh there's not no none at all they shut them down oh that's

[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:29.820]
the same you know you don't need valet parking in this place I mean all the parking is so close

[01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:33.580]
number one and number two you don't have to worry about getting mugged that's true too thank you

[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:37.080]
save a lot of money in any of the words you don't have to worry about your car getting smashed up by

[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:45.540]
the valet parking guys twice in one season like I did do a session in huh 101 okay all right good talking

[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:50.380]
see you there well by the way speaking of cars I mentioned this a couple of weeks ago when I had

[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:56.040]
my previous episode about what was it two three weeks ago driving in the airport and the car just

[01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:00.900]
stopped it's a computer thing and a guy called in these said well you know when that when you're

[01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:05.740]
a check engine light comes on and the thing starts flashing reduced engine power it has to do with

[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:11.660]
your gas cap remember that and the guy to a point was right which we were very skeptical as it

[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:16.200]
sounded simplistic and ridiculous but if you look on a gas cap which which spends their time reading

[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:21.400]
your gas cap anybody out there read your gas cap oh of course not but it says on there that if the

[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:26.120]
cap isn't sealed tight until it starts doing the clicking thing that the check engine light can come

[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:32.320]
on and the freaky things can happen however a couple of weeks before that the ABS brake being out

[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:35.980]
the light came out and then come to find out that we're not there wrong with the ABS brakes now the

[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:42.180]
new deal that started a couple of days ago getting the car I go to the store I come home I shut it

[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:47.800]
off and guess what now the air conditioning comes on after I've shut off the ignition that's

[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:54.300]
right I've shut it off take the key out and here comes the air on baby so needless to say it

[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:58.180]
doesn't take too very long before the battery is dead in a goddamn door kneel dead of the most

[01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:04.240]
of the people living in the sunrise and it's a computer thing and I hate to break the news

[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:08.260]
since I got that car into a Chevy dealer right now once they get it fixed you won't be seeing that

[01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:13.680]
car my garage no more because like I tried to say that they wants to computer even if they

[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:18.920]
claim they fix it it starts playing with your mind especially if you had that real bad experience

[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.580]
like I didn't Chicago you computer decided that it was just going to you know pin that accelerator

[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:26.620]
into the floor I couldn't stop that thing for a lot of money and thank God that the pillar did

[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:33.060]
there under the Ritzkarten hotel oh yeah it's computerized baby it's a well it's a little computer

[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:37.820]
let somebody else get killed in okay I'll pass so I just thought I would share that with you

[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:42.220]
especially since the 99's are out we did have you see with this audience it's hard to tell whether

[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:46.680]
they're given it a real story or a bunch of bullcrab but the 99 vets are out and it got only

[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:53.200]
those who may actually be driving one okay sir maybe you shouldn't just they replace the computer

[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:59.420]
itself still wouldn't convince me well listen I had a question for you about the flyer

[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:07.060]
reminds me of Christine it's just evil now go ahead the flyer yeah they picked up these are right

[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:13.680]
yes I think that's a pretty considering what they had a pretty good improvement and I think you're

[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.960]
in and you're out everybody's picking them as a team to go but I haven't heard much about them I

[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.300]
wanted to know what you thought and if you thought that uh that's a big step in the right direction

[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:25.120]
for them this year I mean he'll I mean well all depends it depends if he plays as well there as

[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:28.760]
he did for the they're going nowhere as long as Roger Nielsen is there they are going nowhere

[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:33.480]
yeah in addition to which they continue they continue putting all the pressure on Lindross and I

[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:37.480]
realized they're paying him a tremendous amount of money but he is never going to be the kind of

[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:42.940]
leader and the kind of uh dominating a superstar that they think yeah I mean he's a great player

[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:46.000]
but he's never going to be what they want him to be he just can't he doesn't have it in him

[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.060]
yes I'm pretty good surrounding talent though with the player and bring them more and all those guys

[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:55.200]
you ever see the the body language and the facial expressions this man he has the look of a

[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:58.660]
loser he just look at him and you think oh this guy knows he's going to lose he just got that

[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:03.320]
sour look yeah every time I yeah you know I think about that I get excited for their season for them

[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:09.000]
and and these are being on a good team and and then I've been and then when I say oh yeah but I hope

[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.600]
I hope he has a good year up there I hope these are at a good year in Filly of course not when they

[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:16.620]
play us but but other than that I hope he plays real well just a stick it to some of these people

[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:21.180]
down here now these two faced phonies who are stabbing in the back and Riponman asked now that he's

[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:25.060]
gone which is the most popular thing to do in sports as soon as somebody gets traded or goes to

[01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:28.400]
another joint right away they start saying well he's stuck anyway you know like Kevin Brown

[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:32.320]
right there you go all right you know hey we're talking about hockey so we better end it now

[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:38.240]
okay thanks but two open lines and Dave I don't mind talking about hockey I just did not

[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:43.620]
going to do any more hockey shows no okay it would be one thing if you did a hockey show with

[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:47.700]
somebody was controversial somebody actually came out and said something something who ripped

[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:51.780]
the management once in a while who said that the general manager the coach made a crappy deal or

[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:55.660]
that something you know because nothing is perfect nobody is perfect you know what I'm saying

[01:27:55.660 --> 01:28:02.260]
that's right nobody's perfect well when it just gets to be a shook fish that it is into a

[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:08.060]
shining we have two open lines in dead county five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty

[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:13.320]

[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:23.120]
hours and twenty two minutes if I didn't have anybody on here I don't talk to missfits okay Andy

[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:30.020]
I don't talk to missfits and there's a difference between chronic and missfits chronic is one category

[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:36.380]
you're in another category you're in the missfit category somebody with no life nothing to say

[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:41.760]
somebody who's extraordinarily annoying I would rather do another hockey show than talk to Andy

[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.740]
from Hollywood and I would rather die before I would do another guy day one of those rumor hockey

before I apologize well no I mean I just read the stuff in the papers and the papers are usually

[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:37.000]
so damn critical anyway so I figured if they said it was good it must have been great well you know

[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.580]
I guess everybody's got their own interpretation what good acoustics are right but I'm you know I'm

Mueller is making almost two million dollars a year they got to get rid of them now they want to

[01:36:57.940 --> 01:37:02.000]
get rid of Terry Carciner and Jeff Norton so bad that it hurts they'd like to put them all three

[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.560]
on a gray hound bus and you know that now the situation is this will respond no no I'm telling you

[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:12.700]
what's gonna happen now am I right they wanted to unload those three guys and their salaries absolutely

[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:18.720]
but now the trading deadline or embargo has been lifted and you're gonna see a flurry of activity

[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:23.680]
we're getting theory flurry no no flurry of activity I thought he was in a back seat when

[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:28.420]
children Kennedy was good that that's what they say that's the story and it said nothing happened

[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:31.640]
nothing and nothing and the children Kennedy by the way had a little bit of a problem here

[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:36.560]
couple a couple of weeks ago he fell off the wagon yeah a little drink it in the drug problem and

[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:41.940]
always comes back to that same excuse again yeah he was in a hummer yeah I bet with Graham James

[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:46.680]
he was in a hummer with Graham James okay remember I think you reached the end of the line on that one

[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:51.700]
see the least they're making a trade they stuck yeah who they trading besides feel like a

[01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:56.920]
butt fan here's the dealer two rumored deals yeah one of them has a three-way deal with the New York

[01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:01.220]
China Kennedy was in a hummer that was that was almost redeemed your other call not quite but

[01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:08.160]
almost it's true yeah I bet it is that's what Graham James said no that's what happened at Edmonton

[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:13.780]
yeah but anyway uh pot van could end up in van kouver with paville burray ending up with a new

[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:20.520]
York Islanders and Trevor Lyndon yeah and Trevor Lyndon would end up in Toronto another scenario has

[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:31.460]
burray possibly ending up in Toronto but time remains the New York Islanders are having a

[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:35.420]
a fire sale they've got so many players now that they're trying to unload to get their salary

[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:40.280]
down first they don't even have a place to play in so they're going to be playing a shini hockey

[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:44.860]
out there in a pond I think but expect quite a bit of activity between now and Friday certainly

[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:49.600]

[01:56:55.460 --> 01:57:01.340]
often about three or four weeks it'll be finished no yes oh what can we do to stop that nothing

[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:05.260]
the way that with the way the audience could have done something to stop that was to watch

[01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:09.220]
at these last the last day june july august september last four months they could have watched it

[01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:13.320]
but they had no more interest they had no more interested in watching the tv showed when they

[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:17.560]
do and calling the radio shows so that's uh that's my loyal audience out there well we're new people

[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:21.020]

[01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:30.860]

lot tomorrow i'm gonna have to have kick his ass out right now the tv thing which is bitter

[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:26.260]
impediment that's the a trigger in the wood pile that's the only thing preventing the show from

[01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:32.820]
being on not just statewide not just nationwide but worldwide all over the god damn freaking world

[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:39.560]
then we'd have some god damn calls now that this tv this bogus thing i want thing i do want to say

[01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:44.080]
though those people really made a great commitment to the show you know what vicki and sticky they

[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:48.800]
made a tremendous commitment to this show you know let's slide it on over here sticking it over there

[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:53.920]
fill it we were like silly putty stick it in the cracks they have a little crack problem anywhere

[01:58:53.920 --> 01:59:00.540]
there's a crack sticking in a crack there's a crack over there sticking in there as in all right

[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:06.020]
but hey it was good that Joe was out there at the borders on Saturday was the wrong

[01:59:06.020 --> 01:59:12.000]
borders but it was a good start a little bit late here's a mobile in Miami hello yeah hello yes sir

[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.820]
yeah first time call it is Mike oh my just want to know your tape on Jimmy Johnson do you think he's

[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:22.260]
taking this whole running game thing a little bit serious yes sir i'm here how you doing now great

[01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:27.740]
hey the phones have been smoking all day i've been busy all day i've been trying they have they have

[01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:32.460]
maybe in brow or date counties been comatose i'm in the Miami day the good news you'll be

[01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:36.800]
pleased to know the people in date are departing they're all getting out you can move back to date the

[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:44.560]
coast will be clear yeah exactly uh what's the reason for when we taking you off you're asking me

[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:50.280]
well you know you know that the readings suck because we don't have enough uh diaries out there

[01:59:50.980 --> 01:59:57.620]
yeah or machines well i mean i mean everybody's watching i can keep arguing i'm gonna i can only tell you

[01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:02.120]
this over the weekend i go to amico to get gas they're like four people and they're getting gas

[02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:06.380]
every one of them tells me they watched every one of nose me number one and number two they watch

[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:11.040]
the show i go to public last night to the grocery to get through your four things people in there

[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:15.580]
i've never heard of before people i would know if uh you know uh they're all watching the god damn

[02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:20.980]
show they all know who i am and they like it but but they can't they cannot they cannot find the

[02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:24.860]
audience for that show they just cannot find it because there's only four and twenty seven

[02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:30.200]
diaries in addition in addition to what they're doing so no promotion there has been none there has

[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:34.460]
been zero promotion like one stick and billboard up there other than that they've had no promotion

[02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:39.120]
they wasted all that money into a new show on the station but conspicuously leaves out this he

[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:42.520]
doesn't even acknowledge that we exist even though they've been running the show twice a night

[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:46.800]
for most of the last three months they pretend the show doesn't even exist on that god damn thing

[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:52.960]
and it's the best show on the station well there you go i agree yeah me too okay pal can i be on the list

[02:00:52.960 --> 02:01:00.020]
sure hang on you bet we have an open line of damn is it gonna change my life are they still gonna

[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:03.800]
have to pay us for next to eight months or whatever it is yeah so if they take it off do we care

[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:08.100]
i mean what the hell are we gonna do without joke clunking around with that ladder in here and

[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:12.960]
then knocking things around what are we gonna do then plus we'll be upstairs anyway see that's

[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:17.680]
an interesting part of this timing too is that we're moving up to our police new studios up on the

[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:22.940]
third floor here allegedly starting in november and they probably have to like break this whole thing

[02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:27.520]
down and then then what would they do well what would they do at that point or maybe if we run

[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:31.700]
some camera cables all the way from up on the third floor all the way down to here you think they

[02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:37.140]
could handle that no i mean we're talking about a major major investment of effort there which of course

[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:43.600]
like i said the very deal at room well here because there's no room for them upstairs like i said

[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:48.060]
well it's been a lot of fun it certainly didn't do us any harm did it besides making me look like a

[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:52.120]
jackass oh it's pretty good we have an open line and i know like being made to look like a jackass

[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:57.700]
open line in date five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the AT&T line actually

[02:01:57.700 --> 02:02:02.560]
i enjoy being made to look like a jackass i love it that's why i'm wearing a stupid beanies on my head

[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:06.220]
i want to be a jackass i'm doing a great job but till and don't tell me i'm not

[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:11.540]
look who i went to work for here huh talking about being a jackass you know book of bride didn't have

[02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:17.220]
a good point excellent point no seriously you occasionally with all the other depressing stuff you

[02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:22.500]
spew out he said how is it possible that these people don't care about their sponsors and they

[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:26.980]
don't i mean you heard these little five-year-old kids doing tags on spots that people are paying for

[02:02:26.980 --> 02:02:34.200]
we can't we can't beg i mean beg copy out of people so that we can do an effective job for our clients

[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:37.580]
i don't want to mention giri sarna by name again but especially him

[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:44.060]
and the center one thing i mean if we if we didn't just do this and make it an automatic pilot

[02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:48.300]
project would it ever have happened no of course not of course not

[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:54.920]
you know the old days back going all the way back to when housey on aim remember housey on

[02:02:54.920 --> 02:03:01.060]
uh... but he does when housey on was there little i house in over diode and she used to recall for the uh...

[02:03:01.060 --> 02:03:06.300]
you know the totals for the appears here's the uh... peaches totals here's the totals

[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:11.080]
those were the days and every morning in fact the one day she didn't have and she was in tears

[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:16.740]
there because i made a uh... ascent of her whatever was but she was right on top of it even at

[02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:20.940]
bit sarah over there who was a hard-nosed bitch even she used to come in every day and with the

[02:03:20.940 --> 02:03:24.600]
erasure and put the new total up there whether it was committal's house or center one or whatever we

[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:28.860]
were collecting for the time to try to do something good in the community besides just be on here

[02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:31.840]
try to flee some money out everybody which most radio stations do

[02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:39.480]
and we come over here and we beg them higher tracy kerosene or this guy's a good guy he's a great

[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:43.640]
promotions guy he's done the dolphin thing before the network he's done the center one thing

[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:48.460]
oh yeah that sounds like a great idea and then behind our back they're going oh yeah like we're

[02:03:48.460 --> 02:03:52.060]
going to pay him are they going to pay him no they're going to really pay somebody to do a job no

[02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:57.280]
no they got they got the relatives in here they got the nephew and they got sand which hey

[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:00.500]
did their credit they got the stuff out there to borders and that's about all they showed up

[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:02.580]
their center day at the right place and that was about it

[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:09.780]
but are they involved in uh... you know getting this and i'll pour care all over there at center one

[02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:13.620]
now she's the pivot man now she's the one that's got to do all the work that the promotions

[02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:18.320]
person who doesn't exist here on this radio station should do so they didn't care about their

[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:21.560]
sponsors they don't really care about what's on the year they don't care about the center one

[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:25.640]
campaign they don't care about anything they just want to work right see they ought to get out of

[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:30.960]
a m just like the cops people did just get those fm slush stations like power 96 and coast and

[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:38.080]
hot 105 and crank out the hits with an s with two s's because they don't give a good they not

[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:41.880]
interested in going through the effort of really being a real radio station it's a joke to them

[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:43.600]

[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:34.980]
room or on anymore you can tell you if information that he gave before was so ponderous and you

[02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:39.860]
was that unbelievable I mean he calls back and I'm sitting here just my life is flashing in front

[02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:43.580]
of my eyes and I'm thinking well there must be something that happened worth putting on it and he

[02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:49.220]
calls back to tell us basically that nothing happened and he said it just saying nothing happened

[02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:53.160]
he has to go through the list of these Martian names of people that haven't been born yet of

[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:58.380]
embryotic anonymous people you know if he said that Mueller was gone or partner was right then we

[02:12:58.380 --> 02:13:02.040]
would have had a party right yeah we danced in the street with Mueller got he's got this guy name

[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:07.980]
Shabbat from the Khabat House yes useless oh please don't put him on anymore okay thanks

[02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:15.060]
bet your life on it oh oh yeah we got to do another hockey show oh my god ponderous

[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:19.140]
this isn't a hockey town what's the point it would be like going up to a

[02:13:19.140 --> 02:13:21.720]
calivant doing a show on soccer what's the point

[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:27.220]
be like going to the middle of god damn side burying doing a goddamn show about uh

[02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:33.880]
shini hockey oh they played up there okay well they got not probably don't have much

[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:41.200]
else to do man he is a scary you know good guy in his own bizarre way and I'm still trying to

[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:47.140]
figure out what that is but he can chase an audience the way faster than Mike Spindell

[02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:52.520]
I have the than that music that we play to uh big cube from those by the way yeah I play music to

[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:56.580]
intentionally try to get the audience uh to call just so that they want to get the music off

[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:01.660]
and he works better than them any day of the week in fact since he made his second go you

[02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:06.340]
notice every line of the board is smoking since he made that second call please they're begging please

[02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:11.560]
don't put him on again we'd rather hear tourism guys farting for four hours than hear rumor again

[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:20.780]
for 10 seconds or did I tap that off yeah he was chopped off he ain't even Jewish 21 before two at

[02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:29.680]
a m what's his obsession with hope okay 144 we're getting re-fermandis over here crap but I'll put it

[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:35.240]
oh it's not about time to do our drawing I guess for my two tickets that's that's 57 bucks a piece

[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:39.960]
that's 114 bucks plus the parking pass the preferred parking it's about $130 worth of crap and
