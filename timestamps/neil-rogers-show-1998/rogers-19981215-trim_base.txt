[00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.020]
Sport Radio 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.720]
You've heard a Neil called 567 0560 toll free for date and

[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.380]
rarer or pound 560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.460]
Opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not

[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.760]
necessarily reflect those of WQAM, easily read acquisitions or the

[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.980]
easily broadcast group.

[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.980]
Now, Neil Rogers on Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.680]
What is a Buffalo Bill?

[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.020]
Who needs a little training?

[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.300]
Like and to understand you don't sound like a fan.

[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:18.680]
Remove the rubber band that shows your slow-tongued cell-team.

[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.460]
Jell-D, your lucky man at Christmas don't care, don't care.

[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.880]
You don't belong there on the air and Jell-D.

[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.500]
Those four can't wait till your voice cracks.

[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.980]
Cause anyone who sounds like that should find another job.

[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.660]
And they should only take you back when both your baby's rock.

[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:57.060]
Jell-D, when you're gonna grow up, you make a toy to throw up.

[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.760]
You silly, squeaky, blue, those two broad-tasting fools.

[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.080]
Your free, new best, this voice, thank you.

[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:15.500]
Now, die, cut, cut, you're a cut, you're a cut.

[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.720]
You know, I've been here to try to thank over the 400 years that I've been on the air.

[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.860]
Have I ever heard anybody whose voice annoys me more?

[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.820]
Who just absolutely drives nails into my brain.

[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.920]
Come on, nail you into the internet.

[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.760]
Yeah, maybe the she.

[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.700]
Was he ever really on the air?

[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.920]
Or did he just audition him?

[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.700]
Or can't you remember that far?

[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.300]
He was on the air.

[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.500]
He actually had a show on the old I-

[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.920]
O-D.

[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.500]
Not for very long though.

[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.320]
No, of course none of those shows run very long.

[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.240]
He was on almost as long as Greg, but not quite.

[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.260]
Yeah, the she- was there right in there.

[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.600]
He was, oh man, but Jell-D, I'm coming to work this morning.

[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.680]
I'm driving along, singing a song.

[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.280]
Just kind of oblivious to everything that's going on in the world.

[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.860]
Not suspecting that George has got sabotaged waiting in the little refrigerator there

[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.140]
and got Hershey's chocolate pieces in there.

[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.820]
Why did you do that?

[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.280]
Tipper Crit, you're always bitching out everybody else for doing that.

[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.200]
And I opened up the little mini refrigerator that my good friend Robert gave us a couple of years ago.

[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.320]
Well, I sure remember Robert, don't I?

[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.680]
No.

[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.340]
Yes, I do.

[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.720]
But at any rate, and I go in there to get my diet Pepsi's and my sole water, whatever might be in there.

[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.560]
And I see a little bag of Hershey's chocolate, little miniature pieces.

[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.400]
I thought I had them hidden.

[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.800]
Oh yeah, you really had it, though, didn't you?

[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.360]
You had them hidden.

[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.060]
Very very well, right.

[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.980]
The refrigerator is about the size of most people's ass, okay?

[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.280]
So how easy is it to hide something in a refrigerator that size?

[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.580]
It's not when you root like this.

[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.560]
It's the size of the average person, the specto, you know, that's about how big it is.

[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.480]
You're full of crap.

[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.480]
So anyway, I'm coming to work this morning.

[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.080]
I'm suspecting that I'm going to be here with a sugar shock when I come in.

[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.340]
And I'm listening, of course, to this station.

[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.900]
Why I'm not really sure, but I'm listening.

[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.220]
And they get to the thing about Edgar Rentoria, okay?

[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.920]
Now, this for anybody with a brain out there is just another example of how it continues ongoing, ongoing, ongoing.

[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.320]
They keep sticking your right in the back.

[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.580]
Correct.

[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.960]
That's right no matter how big it is.

[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.580]
Because, well, you know, he's eligible for arbitration in Yadi, Yadi, Yadi.

[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.520]
And he was only making two and a quarter last year.

[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.760]
But he probably going to get about a million and a half this year.

[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.500]
And then Dave Dombrasio come on tomorrow and pedal some story.

[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.020]
Well, anyway, to make a long story short, there he is as always, as predictable as snow in the North Pole, okay?

[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.140]
A smithering suckle.

[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:42.900]
I will never ever as long as I live respect Joe Rose or Jeff DeForest until the day when one or both of them gives guilty a knuckle sandwich right on the air.

[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.100]
I will never have respect for either one of them.

[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:57.540]
Because how anybody can restrain himself sitting there and listening to the other never ending smithering suckle, like this goes on and on no matter what the situation is.

[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.980]
Maybe that's his role on the show.

[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.340]
Maybe when he was hired, he was told, we want you to be a smithering suckle because we heard your voice and we think you won't have to redo much acting.

[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.040]
You won't have to do a put on anything.

[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.920]
Just for yourself, you'll be a smithering, never ending suckle that always like a smithering suck.

[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.760]
Remember that sound?

[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.500]
Smithering sucks?

[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.360]
Boy, does he get on my nerves?

[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.460]
I mean, I don't, you know, it's not personal because I don't know him well enough for it to be personal.

[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.880]
It's business.

[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.440]
And man, how these, of course the sports nerds, like I said, they had the five-year-old kids on there a couple of weeks ago, Hank was on route or something.

[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.940]
And they're on there.

[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.860]
And the very first call of somebody wants to, you know, some advice on who we should bet, the points, but will they cover the spread?

[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.800]
Well, you know, the overs and the under, the ins and the outs, the ups and the downs.

[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.280]
So when you deal with the sports nerds, it doesn't make it, it could be a minor bird.

[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:54.120]
As long as it's somebody on the other end of the phone who's willing to hold a conversation about the same incestant repetitions meaningless garbage, they don't care.

[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.060]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.600]
Oh, but that voice, that voice, that sound, it's not only the sound of it, but what's coming out?

[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.980]
What are you saying?

[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.460]
And he was saying something reasonable with a bad voice, you'd say, well, here's the guy that really knows his stuff, he just got a bad voice.

[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.640]
But he's got a bad irritating voice and he sucks.

[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.940]
He sucks and he sucks and he sucks and he never stops sucking.

[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.140]
God, we'll just once, once in your life come on here and stop being a company's show, okay? Just once.

[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.320]
The funds are for God.

[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.820]
Exactly.

[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.680]
Enough of the God damn sucking already, Gelly, Jesus, God and Joseph.

[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.980]
Man.

[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.260]
You're a bastard, you're a stupid.

[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.560]
Yeah, I'm sitting here this morning, your captive audience is about 20 to 10 and I hear that sound.

[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.920]
I just cracked the monitor up just a little teeny tiny bit just to see if we're on here.

[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.460]
When you work on this station, you have to check that out very frequently.

[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.960]
And there's that sound again, just like scraping nails, not on a blackboard, but on your rectum.

[00:06:52.340 --> 00:07:03.140]
Oh, all over your body, like falling into a river of red ends, that are just crawling inside and outside and all over your head and your ears and just everywhere.

[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.160]
The sound of that voice, smithering and sucking.

[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.240]
So anyway, we got to the information first here yesterday, by the way.

[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.280]
Camera on Martian is out at Channel 4.

[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.740]
You see, this is what happened.

[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.920]
He's the one that's going to have to pay for it.

[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.280]
Not that he's a great and even a good guy.

[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.300]
I mean, you know, I can handle him even in spite of those lips.

[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.740]
But, you know, he's the never-stolen freight train and I have watched Channel 4 for years by default.

[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.080]
But this is the price they pay for f***ing over our good friend Barbus Lone.

[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.040]
Right? There you go.

[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:41.740]
I told you, I told you I'd have Mickey Day and Anchvo Griffin put a goddamn evil curse on you people at Channel 4 and it worked like a charm.

[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.960]
Like a lucky charm.

[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.900]
They were ratings are so goddamn low that you can't find them with the Mount Palomar telescope.

[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.980]
And they brought in that, I don't know what they saw in her, that Ann Roberts.

[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.860]
She is as wooden as a board.

[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.160]
No, seriously, she's as wooden as a surfboard.

[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.780]
She's just, she's an old Barbie doll.

[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.640]
She's not a Barbie doll that's cute or pretty or that delivers the news particularly effectively or well or into.

[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.980]
She's just a face.

[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.360]
Whereas Barbus Lone, at least that was here for a while and she was kind of like had some warmth to her.

[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.820]
Ann Roberts is about as warm as an ice cube.

[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.580]
In fact, maybe she knows Hillary.

[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.120]
Maybe she's another ice princess.

[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.080]
Huh?

[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.080]
And we had the news.

[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.900]
We had the scoop for you right here first yesterday, boys and girls.

[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:37.300]
Channel 4's early and late evening news cast suffered from low ratings and they got the assistant news director from Channel 7 and they're going right after them.

[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:44.760]
They're going to go on there and they're going to put people on hyperventilating and carrying on and hovering over the news desk and hovering over each other.

[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.580]
Doing her goddamn best, emulate Channel 7 and that stupid garbage that swill that they put on and pretend is news.

[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.200]
With a bunch of fruit flies, splitting around like butterflies and heat.

[00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.320]
Isn't that basically what they do?

[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.680]
Thank God they got somebody much over there like Rick Santa.

[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.720]
By the way, be ever told stories about how he used to dress up in the morning.

[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:12.740]
Nine minutes after 10 at 5.60 WQM or QAM VAM will be out at a location to be disclosed momentarily.

[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.120]
We didn't do that great yesterday and I wanted to dress that a great length today by the way.

[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.600]
Thought you asked holes in Pemberg Pines.

[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.860]
Oh, seriously, I think that there are a lot of assholes.

[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.000]
We have many assholes of course in town because we got four million people down here.

[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.740]
But you know, Pemberg Pines I think is the center. That's the core.

[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:34.320]
That's assholeville is Pemberpines, which is why George got out of there by the way.

[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.380]
He used to live there. I used to live there. Pemberg Lakes.

[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.440]
And I looked around and I said, boy, what about your assholes? I'm getting out of here right now.

[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:41.880]
Oh!

[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.120]
Alright, this is Mari Fovitch wishing you a happy Hanukkah.

[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.120]
ABC may have turquoise back on Ellen but not the gay community.

[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:54.460]
This fall ABC's latest hit comes out of the closet. The Nancy Boys mystery.

[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.100]
We clean apartment, go to the gym and solve mysteries.

[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.400]
Join the Nancy Boys as time after time they put their asses on the line.

[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.780]
Who's that on with the grind?

[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:12.760]
That's the premiere episode when Bruce's tank top mysteriously disappears as the gym and lands promises to get to the bottom of things.

[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.340]
And solve the mystery.

[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.540]
You know, Stefan, old piece of Christmas trash with walking away.

[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.840]
I came out of the song. I think it's time for his Christmas.

[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.340]
The Nancy Boys mysteries.

[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.940]
They're gair than gay.

[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.040]
Special guest appearance by Richard Simmons.

[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.800]
Coming this fall on ABC.

[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.380]
1014 at 560 WQM. So anyway, let's hear some good things about Camberl Martian.

[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.060]
Okay, number one, he never stole a freight train.

[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.820]
Number two, he was like an offensive other than it took me a while.

[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.820]
It took me about five or six years to get used to the lips.

[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.600]
Which he couldn't help that, huh?

[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.500]
He had big lips.

[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.340]
Oh, that's, you know, something.

[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.800]
That's what I should have played before I started talking about this.

[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.180]
I should have played.

[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.300]
I'm not going to pay for the little things.

[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.120]
Little things. Little things. Little things.

[00:10:59.300 --> 00:10:59.780]
Little things. Little things. Little things.

[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.440]
I'm very proud of my new nose ring.

[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.800]
So anyway, like I said, once you got by the lips and his appearance, which wasn't the greatest.

[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.860]
See, I don't know what it is about me, but if I'm going to look at somebody doing the news,

[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.960]
they don't have to look great like Bill Hummer on CNN in the morning, who does look very good.

[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.480]
Or they can look like Ralph Renek didn't look good.

[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.340]
I mean, did he look good?

[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:19.600]
No.

[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.740]
He never looked good. Even at birth, he didn't look too good.

[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.520]
But he was not offensive.

[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.300]
He wasn't a grotesque, disgusting, horrendous thing to look at.

[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:28.700]
Was he?

[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:29.560]
No. He was okay.

[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.320]
And Robert, she wasn't attractive.

[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.640]
She was very, very much too but she wasn't offensive looking.

[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:36.100]
No.

[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:36.860]
Uh-huh.

[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.060]
But the Cambrale, it took like I said, now that we're finally used to him.

[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.760]
I'm used to him. I like Cambrale.

[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.580]
He did a lot of good stuff for charity in the community.

[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.520]
He's a good guy.

[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.820]
He never stole a freight train.

[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.240]
And he's out.

[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.000]
How come Brian Norcross, that little twit, that little hysteria,

[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.100]
and of course they don't want to get rid of him because he'll fit right in with their plans now.

[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.900]
That's the direction they want to go in.

[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.000]
Hype reventilating and hysterical.

[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:05.920]
The Rick Sanchez, Brian Norcross, take everything and whip it up into a major controversy and a frenzy routine.

[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.900]
And that's the responsible job of doing the news.

[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.920]
They don't give a crap about the news about any other, but they are the news that works for you.

[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.860]
And the article I'm reading here, one of, in both papers, by the way, it says it didn't work for them.

[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.760]
It may work for us, but it didn't work for them.

[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.060]
The ratings were in the, uh, uh, crap, uh, is what it says.

[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.300]
I mean, there are people on there who are very offensive like Jim Berry.

[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:33.080]
The Cambrale Martian is a black guy, but you don't look at him doing the news as a black guy doing the news.

[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.860]
Even though he used to be a sports guy doing the sports.

[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.260]
Now he's a black guy doing it.

[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.340]
But you don't look at him once you get by the lip thing and by the, you know, and the name thing, Cambrale, me and out of,

[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:47.760]
if he would have changed his name to like, uh, John Ed Tom Tom Martian, huh?

[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.020]
That would have been a little more acceptable, but Cambrale, you know, when you come right down to it, how many people do we know?

[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.860]
I think the culture barrier, the cultural barriers in this country are becoming much worse than they used to be.

[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.400]
How many guys do you know named Cambrale?

[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.040]
Besides Cambrale Martian, is do you know anybody else named Cambrale?

[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:06.200]
No.

[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.480]
Could you name me if I held a gun to your head? Could you name me one other person on the face of the earth named Cambrale?

[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:11.740]
No.

[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.300]
How many people I asked this yesterday got no response since the Jets game was just forget about the game.

[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.720]
That's not the important thing.

[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.700]
Forget about the social significance.

[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.700]
How many people do you know named Keachon?

[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:30.400]
And see, this is what another thing that gets me about these sports nerds is that they can come up with any ridiculous X-ray hip.

[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.820]
What are these stupid assholes names?

[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.720]
Oh yeah, and the sports casters and the sports fans.

[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.420]
Oh, there's X-ray right over there.

[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.340]
There's extra X-ray, whatever his name is.

[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.820]
There's the artist formerly known as an asshole, whatever it is.

[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.080]
But how many people seriously do you know named Keachon?

[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.180]
Do you know anybody named Keachon?

[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:52.840]
No.

[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.640]
Cambrale?

[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:54.040]
No.

[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.940]
Uh, Boama?

[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.940]
I know a couple of latrines.

[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.560]
Yeah, I just hit the latrine on the way before the show, yeah.

[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.200]
So Jim Berry, like I said, he's offensive.

[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.260]
He's a black guy who wants to be a professional black guy who's always doing his duket and jive and and rap and and crap.

[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.160]
And he's offensive.

[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.120]
He's obnoxious.

[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.280]
He's disgusting.

[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.760]
He is an impediment to channel four news.

[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:23.880]
And immediately when his post comes on there, as soon as he's going to do his make believe professional black guy sports, I flip to my clicker starts clicking automatically.

[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:35.660]
I've got that locked into my Sony XPR TV that when Jim Berry comes on under any circumstances, the set just starts going all over the place, any place but until he gets off of it, then I go back to channel four.

[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.140]
I guess they're not going to be impressed over the fact that I was one of the few people that religiously watch channels for news.

[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:50.240]
Like I said, not because it's great, not because I really like it all that much, but because I certainly won't want that simple Jackass Tony cigarette on channel six.

[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:50.980]
He's an asshole.

[00:14:50.980 --> 00:15:01.860]
Other sports nerd turned the news guy, which is not good enough for him. He keeps trying to interfere in the sports over there is what we hear and a real prima donna along with Jennifer Velapi who we understand is even bigger prima donna.

[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:12.300]
And when they get their new studios in Miramar by the way, she wants to be picked up in a limousine. We were reading the other day and the brought to and fro and back and forth because we all know that her don't stink.

[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:12.880]
That's right.

[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.040]
So I certainly wouldn't watch that I wouldn't watch channel seven news under any circumstances.

[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.900]
Although they do have their own weather furry, which I think is kind of amusing.

[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.720]
And channel 10, I mean, why is channel 10 number one all the time in their news?

[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:35.080]
Their news that it doesn't even cross my mind. That's how much I watch channel ten news. It doesn't even enter into my mind.

[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.560]
And that was before that I nagged into that crappy apes on me.

[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:44.600]
It didn't enter my mind then before and it still doesn't know. Dwight Lauderdale since he shaved off the mustache looks like he got that aging disease.

[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.440]
He looks like he's 120 years old.

[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.500]
He looks like an old tired man still doing the news on TV.

[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:57.660]
It's like they propped up Ralph Renek. They brought him back from the grave and they propped him up at a chair at channel four, which they probably get higher ratings than they got now.

[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.460]
And that's what it's like looking at Dwight Lauderdale.

[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.320]
And Diane, like I said with her hair problem.

[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:09.640]
And they just, I mean, is there any like Todd Tungen? That's what they're asking in all the newsrooms all over town every day.

[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.820]
Who's Todd Tungen today? But other than that, I mean, he's just a silly goose.

[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.580]
The only person I do like over there on channel ten news is Don.

[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.920]
No. Yeah. He's great.

[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.340]
For my money, he's of the regular.

[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.740]
I don't want to offend my good friend Weaver the weatherman, but they stuck him at three in the morning.

[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.720]
We don't see him anymore. It's a great guy and a great meteorologist, but he's a three in the morning.

[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:36.140]
And I don't want to offend my good close personal friend Bob Soaker, who's also very good, but like, you know, hyperventilates a little bit too much lately, but a good guy.

[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.460]
But Don, is I would say the best weather guy in the market. Is there any debate on that?

[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:42.580]
No.

[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:43.820]
Would you disagree with that?

[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.940]
No. Okay. Don, what does Don?

[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.200]
No. Whatever he knows, he shares with us. He's good. He doesn't hyperventilate. He's not irresponsible.

[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:55.140]
He doesn't lift everybody into a frenzy. He doesn't cause wife and a goddamn supermarkets and hardware stores.

[00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:00.600]
Every time we have a goddamn rainstorm, Don, though, is great. Other than that, Channel 10 blows.

[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:06.140]
So the bottom line is I'm going through this long kind of a looted thing because she what they're trying to do is style.

[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:11.360]
Instead of like good people, like we used to have John Hambrick, who was great. He was too professional, I guess.

[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:18.060]
We didn't have room for John Hambrick in this market because he was a professional news guy who actually had some credibility.

[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.700]
He looked like a real serious news guy on there. He was a great guy, by the way.

[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.660]
And he's not here anymore. Son is doing this stuff on what channel is it? Whatever channel it is.

[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.620]
What channel is that? That the Jack Hambrick is on is that four?

[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.160]
Wherever he is. And he's okay. Don't look too good, but he's okay.

[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.780]
But news in this town, man. It's a joke. There just isn't any news anymore.

[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.480]
So, Cambrill, we wish you the best. You're a good guy. You never still afraid to train. Did a lot of good stuff for kids and for charity.

[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.740]
And he's a good guy and he gets a reward for it by getting stuck in a wreck.

[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.840]
And that's right. And they're going to make him the scapegoat for their failures to put on a real good newscast.

[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.380]
And of course, how about that God damn ham-hawk, Al Sunshine, huh?

[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.140]
How about now give him a little bit of the blame? Al Sunshine with those disgusting arms of his.

[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.700]
Right in the middle of the dinner hour. Are we going to watch Al Sunshine?

[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.280]
Oh, Jesus pointing and pointing. You know, we'll point it yourself. Okay, you fat part.

[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:13.060]
Go look at yourself in a mirror and start working on yourself. You fat, but chubby piece of third.

[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.140]
Wave in those ham-hawks. Yeah, right.

[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.280]
Shame on you is why I say shame on you, Al Sunshine.

[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.380]
So there you go. They're shaking it and they're quick and we got stations moving sixes where four used to be in fours, where six used to be.

[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:35.280]
And the thing I love about Channel 6 is every five minutes they come on and they say, if you can't see the picture, you know, don't you love that? Call our technical analyst.

[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.760]
Okay, call up George Corsair over QA and he's got some spare time. He'll work on it for you and the picture too.

[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:49.600]
And of course, if you can't, if you still can't see the picture, just turn on your FM radio and you can listen to our newscast on FM only by a quirk of, you know, nature.

[00:18:51.580 --> 00:19:09.460]
Here's a call from Hollywood. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hello. I'm speaking to you. Yes. Are you speaking to me? Yes. And?

[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:17.180]
Do you believe that? See what I'm saying? We've got 20 hours a day for these people who have no lives whatsoever. 20 hours every day of your lives.

[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:28.920]
I don't want to hear about Jimmy Johnson. I don't want to hear about Danny Merino. I don't want to hear about the dolphins. I don't want to hear about the jets. I don't want to hear about the bills. I don't want to hear about Bill Cauer. I don't want to hear about any guy punching his coach in the face. I don't want to hear about none of that crap.

[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.020]
Okay. You understand? No. No.

[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:38.980]
22 and a half minutes. I only had to say hello to this guy 16 times before he realized that I was saying hello.

[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.800]
And he's giving me a song of events. I don't want to hear about that. I want to know how many guys you know named Keishan.

[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:55.440]
I want to know what this whole cultural thing is now. I've never had a, even an attempt at a satisfactory explanation of where these black names are coming from in America today.

[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:06.680]
Driving a stake between the races in America with these ridiculous ass. How many guys, let me ask you this. How many guys do you know named Ampourney?

[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:08.560]
Huh?

[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:21.340]
Number Ampourney Hopkins. He used to put the lotion in the, yeah, right? Ampourney Hopkins. And then there was Ampourney. What was his name? He was in psycho. Perkins. That's the last talk. Very good.

[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:29.180]
There's a great letter to the editor by the way this morning in the hero. Very, very short. One of the great letters in the history of letters to the editor.

[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:36.300]
And they put a little headline on it with a, you heard it says the universal language and the S is in this form of a dollar sign, the universal language.

[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:47.280]
And the letter from a Samuel's in Miami Beach says, after living in Miami, date County for 40 years, I don't speak Spanish. Nor do I have to. My money speaks for me and everybody understands.

[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:58.140]
Oh, I go on a Samuel's that away to stick it right in their puts. No, speak it upon you. Okay, here are only $50 million and blow it out your ass. Nice going a Samuel's. That's the kind of guy respect.

[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:08.040]
Who's not going to like, you know, bend over and wilt under the pressure of a bunch of a banana boat people who don't want to get with a program. Speaking of that, here's higher. Hello.

[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:19.640]
Good morning. Yes, sir. Yeah, be good. No, no way. No way. Who's a okay? How you doing, sir? And we don't want to go anymore Puerto Ricans. You're either yes, sir. How are you doing? I just called the hell. Hello. See how everything's doing. I got a.

[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:30.240]
What does that mean? You call the say hello and see how everything's doing. What does that mean? Well, I just send a radio on. Yeah. And I heard you were talking about some strange names. Yeah, I got one for you. Santisha McNair.

[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:45.420]
Santisha, I know the least 40 women named Santisha. You do over three guys. No. I thought it was the only one. Santisha. Santisha McNair. Yeah, who that be? Oh, she's a girl. She goes to school within Jersey. She's the cry all the time. What do they call her? Tisha? She's called a crybaby. Okay.

[00:21:48.100 --> 00:22:05.720]
Well, it's a lot easier to call her cry. Maybe that's what Johnny Debson and call her Santisha. How you doing, Santisha? What is this? What is this with these freaky black names? I think what America wants to know? Do we want to know? We want to know. I think it's some kind of a goddamn code is what I think.

[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:22.100]
Is it getting warm in here? Is it my imagination? Huh? Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm getting all worked up to a frenzy already this morning. So anyway, we raised a very mediocre 610 bucks in Pemberg Pines and wherever else we were yesterday. That's the two locations combined. I told those guys they should have stayed with the hell they were.

[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:43.800]
So, and we got 247 bucks in the mail this morning, which I thank you profusely by the way. 857. So our ongoing total is 85,796% of one and we still have seven of the borders yet to be poured in for last week. Just like we also have yet to get my check from what you call for last week from why me last week. But it is the holidays and that's a good excuse why things are slowing down a little bit.

[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.840]
But I'm sure that Carol will have some information up to date for us any minute now on a facts machine. Right, Carol?

[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.920]
Oh boy. The battle, but we'll win it.

[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:03.660]
Where do you find it, Kaplan? White where you got it. Sports where you bought that candy, a little secret.

[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.900]
Help. It's me again, Bob.

[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:12.640]
Do you know when you're done? How do you like that? He's buying candy and bringing you. I thought somebody gave it to him trying to find it off.

[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:20.960]
I'm dreaming of a white paper. Yeah, like being a key show.

[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.560]
I think white guys are the start name of their kids, Keesha.

[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:31.880]
They're the ones who are trim and far said.

[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.440]
I think boy, a lot of start name in our kids, yet.

[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:48.880]
I'm dreaming of a white paper with every force.

[00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:00.480]
I'm a white paper.

[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:13.360]
I'm a white paper.

[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:18.900]

[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:27.000]
We were just reminiscing. We photoshopped because we had some, was it facing any of these companies?

[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.200]
We mastered. We digitally. I love the companies. Of course, even though it's embarrassing.

[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:39.520]
We were thinking if Elvis would have just shared some of that food that he overweight with Karen Copper, they might both still be alive today.

[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.460]
You ever stop and think about that? You ever think about it? No.

[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.560]
Elvis even sounds like a normal name. We know several Elvis grew back. There you go.

[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.120]
Although he's another stupid joke. But we know a few people named Elvis.

[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.220]
But Keeshawn, and what was the one he gave us? Botswana?

[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.300]
Here's West Palm Beach. Hello.

[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.800]
Neil, how are you today?

[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.100]
I do know one Keeshawn.

[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.620]
Really? Yes, I do. But he also is a dark neighbor.

[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.340]
Yeah, oh, you have a dark neighbor.

[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.640]
Yeah, but he's only four. I think he was just named after the football player.

[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.480]
What? That's pathetic. That's what we need.

[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:19.860]
There's a lot more people named after football players like Karim, Abdul, Jabbar, whose name was Bob Smith when he was born.

[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:20.440]
But he's there.

[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.180]
Yeah, I called George and said it was okay since I couldn't get through to my congressman.

[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.000]
If I got to talk to you about Clinton for a minute.

[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:27.440]
Yeah.

[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.560]
Does this be any more pathetic?

[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:37.480]
They don't care that even Eliana Gross-Latinin, 70 and 80 and 90% of the people that are calling her congressman are saying no to impeachment.

[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.840]
And they don't give a crap. In fact, the people are saying one thing.

[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.220]
And the more they say that, the more these assholes are moving in the opposite direction, according to what I'm reading this morning.

[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:46.880]
Do they think they're mine?

[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.480]
Do they forget what happened November 3rd?

[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:50.200]
Huh?

[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.560]
Do they think that's not going to happen again?

[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:53.160]
Huh?

[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.240]
If you think that the voter apathy is not going to happen again.

[00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:01.340]
You know, something in a way this is probably even though it's going to make for a lot of months of grief in the bull crap on TV,

[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.060]
and since the OJ trials over already, I mean, it'll keep people off the streets.

[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:09.920]
Even though we're going to have to go through all of that, the fact is there is no chance he'll be convicted in the trial in the Senate.

[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.680]
And come 2000, all of these right-wingers, and even the moderate Republicans are going to get us sucked in.

[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.560]
They're all going to say goodbye to them.

[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.460]
Because don't forget the house gets the whole house gets reelected every two years.

[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:27.220]
But what's going to happen is that the voter apathy that you've seen for the last 1,300 years is going to be gone.

[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:31.680]
And they're going to have to be in the evolution because the people are going to be fired up and pissed off.

[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.100]
Absolutely.

[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.100]
Absolutely.

[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.460]
And they're going to find out the right wing is going to get what they've needed all this time.

[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.100]
Yeah, absolutely correct.

[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.340]
Neil, can we make one request for Palm Beach?

[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.420]
Anything you want to play?

[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.120]
Okay.

[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:47.720]
We love you.

[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:48.180]
Thank you.

[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:48.860]
That's a great life.

[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.500]
How about that?

[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.340]
That's for Palm Beach.

[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:52.760]
I'll tell you what, here's something for Pemberpine.

[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.480]
Oh, they hate me in Pemberpine.

[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:56.480]
What have I ever done to them?

[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.980]
I mean, George and I both moved out of there.

[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.800]
Maybe that maybe they're holding that against us.

[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:00.700]
Could it be that?

[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:00.980]
Uh-huh.

[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:01.280]
Yeah.

[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.440]
Not too big on us in Pemberpines.

[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:08.720]
We had an intersection yesterday when you told me that they went to Pines and where the hell was it?

[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.240]
University?

[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:10.460]
Yeah.

[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.460]
To the Hooters.

[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.840]
Try to pick up some ugly chicks over there that can't get laid by anybody else.

[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.100]
When you told me they were over there, I thought, boy, that's a busy intersection.

[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.580]
And I would say 95% of the people that hang out in that area.

[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.080]
Like I said, 82% of those people speak English.

[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.100]
About 40% of them actually speak English in that part of the town.

[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.680]
20% or 30%.

[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.200]
And they went over there and they couldn't raise enough money to even get laid as a matter of fact.

[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.260]
That's what they were trying to do.

[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.880]
Or maybe that's where the excess went.

[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.220]
Maybe the cash money that they got.

[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.260]
Maybe that all went to.

[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.120]
Are you on talking about?

[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.480]
Oh, boy, because I noticed it kind of ended abruptly yesterday.

[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.440]
They did not hang around to get their thousand dollars yesterday over there at Hooters.

[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.080]
So Sam and Chris, the nephew, they'll be taking the QA and Ven out today.

[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.660]
And we better, is it crawl springs and we decided that for sure?

[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.080]
We'll let you know the exact location.

[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.780]
We'll be in crawl springs, okay?

[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.520]
And then between your gang meetings and your gang bangs up there,

[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:05.880]
I'm hoping that some of you can take some time out and help us out and pick up your best of the old merchandise,

[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.240]
your CDs and cassettes and t-shirts and whatever other.

[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.460]
And we got some crap to give away to you, some dolphin t-shirts and whatever else.

[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.820]
Some of the ones that say Keishan, sucks on the back.

[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:15.840]
Keishan.

[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.060]
I wish I had a knee, a list of all the idiotic names.

[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:21.560]
In fact, what?

[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.120]
Wait a minute.

[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.460]
What's that one name?

[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.040]
What is that one name that Dave Hyde mentions in his cross to columnist point?

[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.200]
Nice going Dave, a column almost worth the reading.

[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:31.900]
Was it in there?

[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.760]
Oh, please don't tell me it's not.

[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.260]
Oh yeah, here it is.

[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.260]
Yeah, he's another dolphin.

[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.020]
Adafn.

[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.420]
What do they call him?

[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.220]
Hey you.

[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.420]
That's what they call him.

[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.900]
Hey bro, like I said, anybody says hey bro, you know that's you know, easily.

[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:53.800]
He's an asshole.

[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:54.320]
That's right.

[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.600]
That went out with Nickers, okay?

[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.620]
That went out with two piece men's bathing suit.

[00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.940]
Hey bro, trying to be cool.

[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.240]
People who try to be cool and hip are about as cool as their frogs.

[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.040]
That's hard.

[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:06.520]
Here's Miami.

[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:06.900]
Hello.

[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.300]
Peel.

[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:08.780]
Yes sir.

[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.640]
You're a disgrace to the Jewish religion.

[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.200]
Yeah.

[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.380]
And, and happy Hanukkah.

[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.020]
Okay, thank you.

[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.800]
Okay, we have an open line that's powered 567, very weak attempt by the way sir.

[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.120]
567-0560, pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.260]
I'm only a, only a culinary Jew, okay?

[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.480]
Oh, I'm only into the deli.

[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.460]
So leave all the rest of the bum while I see somebody else.

[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.040]
Here's the lady in Miami.

[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:32.400]
Hello.

[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:33.960]
Yes ma'am.

[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.240]
Hi.

[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.380]
I was just going to answer a question about the name.

[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.560]
Yes, what is that?

[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:38.780]
What do that be?

[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.780]
I hope that first and we don't even know.

[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.580]
You know, even the starches don't know how do you like that?

[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:46.080]

[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.600]
It's like a very, I don't know, they, I think it's a plot.

[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.000]
They name their kids T1nika and all these.

[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.880]
T1nika, how you doing T1nika?

[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.100]
And Oprah, what kind of a name is Oprah when you come right down to it?

[00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.980]
The kids can't even spell their own names.

[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.660]
Right, they can't even spell Sarah much less T1nika.

[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.280]
They can't even say it.

[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.340]
Oh, I'm talking about Xavier.

[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.420]
Man, back to you, thank you.

[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.940]
There's a dark, conflicted lady and she's chocolate about it because she's thinking, you know something you got appointments there.

[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.640]
You honky-basted over there.

[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]
I don't even know how myself what it's all about.

[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.960]
Just because somebody one day told you if you're, if your complexion is darker than like four on the Eritre scale,

[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.000]
then you got to come up with some anaphyracuner kind of name or something.

[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.140]
Kishon, any sports assholes?

[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.960]
Oh, did you see that plate Kishon made?

[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:32.860]
What?

[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.840]
What is that?

[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.040]
What language would you be speaking?

[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.580]
You know, when we get into that bilingual thing, which I certainly don't want to do again,

[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:42.720]
unless we read that letter for the editor, that was great.

[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.000]
From A Samuel's on Miami Beach.

[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.420]
But you ever talk about that thing?

[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.900]
Let's slow it down a little bit.

[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.360]
Because if you're talking Kishon and T1nika and Isbulacrap, you do not speak in English.

[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.300]
You do not even speak in Sanskrit.

[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.020]
I say let's go back and start speaking Latin is what I say.

[00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.560]
Okay, let's have a Latin revolution.

[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.340]
We're not talking Latin as in Hispanic.

[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.880]
We're talking Latin is let's put the togas back on.

[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.720]
Oh, it's speaking of that.

[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.940]
I got that great article about, where is it?

[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.380]
Oh, leave it to my friends, the Dutch.

[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.100]
They know their craft, baby.

[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.500]
So it's not both things back in town or Zioff flying around again, by the way.

[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:15.760]
Correct.

[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:16.160]
Huh?

[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.160]
You think you have any other talent?

five sixty and five five sixty you know it's it's really amazing to me and very

[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:14.240]
disturbing that the people in Orlando of all the parts of the state the radio

[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.840]
group is there those are the ones when they call us they want to talk to us

[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.740]
about boring Bob Lasseter about people that nobody ever heard of in this market

[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:24.160]
and nobody cares about that that seems to be like an obsession with those

[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.640]
poor but I can understand that because they have nothing even even closely

[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:31.720]
resembling real radio or shouldn't say that up there in Orlando it's a mythical

[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:37.960]
it fits in with a whole business issue thing you know fantasy land but

[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.640]
there are almost 90% of the time we get a call from up there it's somebody

[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:45.740]

[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:38.800]
gildies voice

[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:45.040]
seriously he he just he drives me up the wall that child he just he just and

[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.640]
and what it makes it even worse is that a there are people listening to him

[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.180]
believe he belongs on the air and b there are sponsors that he's doing

[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.640]
commercials for he's doing commercials

[00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:00.200]

[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.760]

murder suicide in white only in the shoes to pitty of the woman that did it

[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.940]
no it was unbelievable this woman is having a fear with the principle across the

[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.560]
street yeah so she decides to kill her husband so she wants to make it look

[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.620]
like an intruder did it so she goes and she ties up her kids with the scheme

[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:43.620]
they have gone the two young kids and she disguises her voice then she goes in

[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.760]
she shoots her husband twice flips his throat stabs him in the heart

[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:52.000]
that side and they end up here and they end up chance of killing yourself two

[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.260]
days later because when the cops came in both the kids that

[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:58.160]
thought that was mommy and she was playing a game uh...

[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:03.180]

[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.400]
traumatic night at pompino park

[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.920]

[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:24.260]
bunch of people the people driving west unsunnerized bullivared at late at night

[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.740]
people driving east ain't doing to believe there but the people driving west to

[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.560]
think that they're driving off-farking the Wyoming or somewhere you know into

[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.120]
the uh... wide open spaces

[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.480]
hey i hate to break the news do you know but when i'm not impressed with your

[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.020]
ultimate with your souped up engine it okay but if you want to go 90 miles an

[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:42.120]
hour on sunrise bullivare with a speed limit is 40 b my guess just get

out of the way for me okay that's number one

[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:49.020]
i mean i'm talking about seeing people doing things that and it just goes through

[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.360]
my mind as i see them doing anti-social

[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.840]
they are doing things in their cars their behavior they're like racing you

[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.120]

he or rangers

[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:11.540]
i just came up with a great idea by the way all you people have named your kids

[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:17.680]
horrendous grotesque names that they'll never be able to pronounce that people will laugh their asses off it in the rest of their lives

[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:25.000]
Instead of giving like candy instead of giving some stupid toy as a holiday gift get a big holiday card

[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:30.360]
And inside that card when the little kid opens it up this year at Christmas or Chanooka time

[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:33.160]
They open it up and there's a brand new birth certificate

[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:38.200]
Oh the real name on it. Oh, that's right. You're no longer amperney. You're like Tony

[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:45.120]
How do you like that? All right. Yeah, you're no longer a T. Bonica. You're a Sally

[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.560]
What do you say? All right? There's a great gift you could give

[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:54.180]
I'm gonna tell you parents that name their kids horrendous grotesque names like moon units

[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:57.920]
Apa and any other things like that. Of course, there's you know too much drugs with the problem there

[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:03.580]
We understand that at least those are funny. No, they were not. Yeah, they're funny if there's somebody else's name

[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:07.360]
Yeah, exactly if they're your name, they're not so goddamn funny, mr.

[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.980]
Okay, and how about moon units brother?

[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:11.360]
Yeah unit

[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:15.360]
Do we yet do easel? I?

[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.660]
Think I once worked with him. I think under the name of Steve nickel

[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:22.580]
We have an open line of date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18 T line

[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:28.760]
Sam and Chris are on their way to not saying who's they but the Coral Springs and we'll let you know the location with the best of meal stuff

[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.120]
I'm sure like to get some I don't want to start pitching again

[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:36.100]
I'd like to get some stuff from Carol from a center one so we can really you know what I'm saying

[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.740]
I'm really trying to get that thing up to 100 grand and I know we can smell it now

[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:44.360]
Do you ever get close to something really good? You're so close you could smell it. You could almost reach out and touch it

[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.660]
And we got that appearance that the board isn't planned in sunrise

[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:52.000]
I keep calling it plantation, but on that side of the street. I guess it's sunrise. Whatever hell it is

[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.060]
You know where it is on sunrise boulevard Saturday noon to two

[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:57.600]
So by the end of that thing on Saturday

[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.580]
We it should be a piece of cake like falling out of bed in the morning

[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:04.220]
Do you have 90 grand with two weeks to go? We'll make that 100 grand easy

[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:09.240]
But we just need to keep pumping away and pumping away and if anybody can do that Sam and Chris

[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:12.220]
They're the guys to keep doing it. Here's a pepper pine. Hello

[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:17.420]
These blacks are so fed up with the white man. That's why they name Kishon. Is it really?

[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.420]
Entremole, the hero and Chick-queal

[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.560]
Chick-queal

[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:25.280]
Yeah, whatever the hell they name their damn kids. Yeah, and that's the problem

[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.380]
They hate the white man basically

[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:32.380]
Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Okay. There you go. There's the answer for the hate the white man

[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:35.840]
So we don't want no honky names no more. We've got to have our own names

[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.240]
Like Isidore is there any man? No, any black guys name is it or no?

[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:46.380]
I mean, you know, there are names that tend to be like David David is sometimes it's a Jewish name sometimes it's a

[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.200]
Goyce name, but it's a very Jewish name

[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.380]
Michael Michael can be a Jewish name can be an Italian name

[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:56.460]
There's some Goyam name Michael, but it's a very Jewish name. There are names that are like Tom

[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.420]
They're not too many Jews name Tom Ed. There was Eddie Fisher

[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:03.300]
There may be a couple of Ed's who are Jewish Ed is a pretty Goyish name, etc. Okay?

[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.740]
But their names that like are not difficult to spell

[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:11.220]
It's not difficult, you know to know what to call somebody

[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:16.340]
I mean, it's got to be a pin and ass you start going to school and your name is like T. Winico

[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.720]
Okay, what do we call you? Huh?

[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:22.160]
His name is Keishon. What do we call him? He's an asshole. Okay, that's easy, no

[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:29.100]
We have an open line in the dead county five six seven oh five sixty and pound five six the only AT&T

[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:36.720]
How about and let me say one other great thing about Ruth's christ daycows by the way since it's one of our fine sponsors and since I we just ate there on Thursday

[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.520]
And since it is so outstanding

[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:44.960]
one of the things that I love is a great restaurant where you don't have to dress up

[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:49.640]
I don't like I'm not one of those people that's into a putting on a tie and a big in case you haven't noticed

[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:53.300]
I'm like not that doesn't it doesn't impress me. It's uncomfortable

[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:57.940]
It doesn't add anything to the ambiancey the occasion in fact going into a great restaurant

[00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:05.480]
Like for example in Vegas you can go into the fanciest restaurants in Vegas and never have to dress up because it's a tourist

[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.640]
joint they don't want to force you to they'll take your money. Thank you

[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.700]
You can go into the Rosewood Grill which is very expensive and very fancieese

[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:16.340]
And the dress like a slob they don't care

[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.580]
Even Norma Kent came in there in eight on my tab of course one time a few years ago

[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:23.080]
Dressed like I mean talk about dressed like a slob

[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:28.100]
I mean so slob only that even I was embarrassed and that takes a lot

[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:33.700]
Did they have any problem with this? No, I don't care less. Okay. We'll take your credit card. Please and there you go

[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:38.540]
They don't care. That's what I love about with Chris you can go in there dressed up all right like

[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:42.800]
And we can just go in there dressed like a real slob. I don't like restaurants where they have that you know

[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:47.120]
Jackets and ties required for men and like evening gallons for ladies or whatever

[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.980]
I don't like that. It's pretentious. It's horsecraft and if I'm gonna spend my money

[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:55.560]
In your joints. How dare you tell me how I have to come dressed

[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:00.000]
You know, I want to keep the riff rath out, you know. Oh, yeah, right. You very

[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.960]
If I want to come into it listen, I want to tell you something

[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:06.500]
What the hell's the name of that goddamn seafood restaurant in Boston

[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:12.140]
We were eating a couple years ago at this very oh in fact that we're gonna get one out there by by me by the sawgrass

[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:16.500]
It's a chain what the hell's the name of that very very legal seafood. It's called

[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:21.400]
It's a great seafood joint. They got the you know the really great New England childhood

[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:25.960]
We were eating in Boston one time downtown in legal seafood

[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:30.020]
And there was a guy in there who looked like they had just scraped him from the bottom of a dumpster

[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:31.840]
sitting in the corner

[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.740]
And this guy is ordering and ordering I mean he had the money to pay for it obviously

[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:43.700]
But you talk about dressed. I mean this guy. He might he maybe he wasn't a burlap set now that I think about it

[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:48.000]
But he had the money and he was paying for it and they're just eating and eating up a storm

[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:51.120]
Did anybody care? No, he didn't smell too bad

[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.980]
He wasn't cutting too much cheese so who cared

[00:51:55.060 --> 00:52:00.200]
I'm like I started to say before I was so rudely interrupted if I'm gonna pay you to come in and eat your food

[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.920]
How you have the audacity to tell me how I got address

[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:10.760]
I gotta put on a goddamn necktie to come in and sit down and feel like I'm gagging and choking while I'm supposed to be sitting here enjoying a meal

[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.240]
Please don't insult my intelligence by unless you're you know one of those snooty people with your nose way up in there

[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:21.360]
That's too good for the rest of us. You're really enjoying your dining experience to one of those joints

[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:26.920]
Where you have to have a suit in the top and you feel like you're in a goddamn zoo to lucky read a straight jacket

[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:33.580]
How can you enjoy a good meal and being a real pig when you're sitting there with a straight jacket and your mobility is limited

[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.080]
Got it

[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:40.740]
So there's the two things we learned already today and it's not even new yet

[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:45.360]
Don't name your kids a bunch of stupid jackass names and don't be telling me what to wear in your restaurant

[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.580]
Got it. Oh good

[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:53.900]
Eight minutes after 11 at 5.50 WQM. They're smoking it out in the Everglades

[00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:00.040]
This is Debbie. Hi, Debbie. I'm interested in getting some operations done

[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:13.940]
You're wondering what you like to start with

[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:19.000]
Well, I need to get everything done probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my

[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:24.840]
My thing okay, we don't do that. No could you do breast implants though?

[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:26.780]
It can't be done

[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:30.260]
The lotion in the basket

[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:32.420]

Don't hurt mommy's little baby. It puts the lotion in the basket

[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:55.440]
I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV. Okay. Can you make me look more like a woman?

[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:59.420]
Well, we'll have to see you first and then I'm looking actually we can tell you that when we see you

[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:03.480]

Yeah, pretty creepy if you ask me I'm gonna tell you some of those kids over there in another building

[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:12.080]
They don't really help, you know, they need to ask assistance. Oh

[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:17.540]
Anybody who has seen a movie and doesn't just pee in their pants when they hear that maybe maybe after the first six thousand times

[00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:19.440]
It might lose some of its impact. I don't think so

[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:23.720]
And if you haven't seen the movie what's out you waiting for for Christchurch

[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:27.340]
Tony Hopkins has he never made more than one or two decent movies in his whole goddamn life

[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:30.580]
And that was one of the good ones. You better go out and rent it. Okay? Oh

[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:35.180]

Yeah, I've got one down these crazy names. Yeah, I was in the hospital with my wife where you're

[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:54.580]
I love children seven several years ago. I overheard these two black women talking about they're gonna name their daughter

[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:58.020]
In the one woman said well she was giving birth she heard the most beautiful name

[00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:03.520]
And that's what she decided to name her daughter and the name was placenta. Mm-hmm lovely

[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.980]
And that nice how you be doing placenta

[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:11.360]

Here's a lady mobile in Miami. Hello

[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.840]
Hello. Yes, ma'am. Hi, Neil

[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:49.900]
Um, you know, I'm a black woman and my my husband is a white male and we've been contemplating a couple of names for the first son

[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:53.580]
Little boy we're having now. Keisha. No, no, no, not actually

[00:56:53.580 --> 00:57:00.340]
No, no, not actually not so on or anything like that. I would like to name a Reese. What do you think about that? What is it?

[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:02.120]
Reese? Reese?

[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:02.740]
Reese

[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:08.500]
R-E-E-S-E is it Reese? No, not as in the Reese's piece. It's like Reese like maybe

[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:12.380]
R-H-Y-S. I thought I spelled one R-H-Y-S?

[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:18.500]
Right. Yeah, exactly. It was pronounced Reese. It was like an old English kind of name. Mm-hmm. That's not too bad. That's not too bad

[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:22.160]
Yeah, that's not too bad. Let's talk about that. I have some things that we might be couldn't even James

[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:25.360]
But that's a very common. I mean, you know, I don't know

[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.440]
But I want to ask you a question though

[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.880]
What why is it you think that these names are I mean personally I also think these names are very outland

[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:37.340]
If you see Sean and D-Sean and Tim Wanika and all these other kind of things. D-Sean. Yeah, I like that

[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:41.360]
Yeah, I mean that I wasn't I personally would never name my kid something like that

[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:47.200]
But what I'd like to know is why why is it that they should name their kids that why is it so normal to name it like something like James

[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.140]
Or Alex are they just to their angle names? That would just say any well

[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:54.880]
It's like it's like with the like a with a pet. I mean not everybody can name their dogs Skippy or

[00:57:55.460 --> 00:58:00.640]
You know tiny or whatever the dog might be but but I think when you start naming your pet like you know

[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.740]
Bizarre weird strange

[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:08.040]
You know, I think people start looking at you like you need some assistance

[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:09.240]
I think

[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:14.740]
In addition, which like I said before your pet and don't have to worry about it because your pets and dumb

[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:18.220]
Whatever it is but your kid has delivered it for the rest of his or her life

[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.820]
That I agree with I agree with that for that one simple reason

[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:23.460]
I think that you shouldn't name your kids these while that landed things because

[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:27.620]
To be honest with you, I need someone another name is something like you know Tim Wanika or something

[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:29.440]
I can't even pronounce reddamel and spell

[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:35.240]
I have to wonder but I mean I think you know people might tend to think that it's like a racist view that you're taking when you say that

[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:38.380]
Well, you know, they're crazy name and I don't think that you're saying

[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:42.540]
I just but where does it come from? Where do these names? Where did this all start?

[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:47.420]
Like like I said before most black people used to have the same names in this country as white people

[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:50.080]
You know like Tom and Joe and Jim and

[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:54.200]
Mary and whatever and now all of a sudden I'm actually in the son uncle Tom that was bad

[00:58:54.200 --> 00:59:00.040]
But now all of a sudden it became like a fad and somebody convinced black people like if you don't name your kids

[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:02.480]
All these bizarre weird names you just ain't happening man

[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:08.380]
Well personally, I think they're making them up. I have to be honest with you. They're not asking names. I mean and and for me

[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:12.220]
A n f v r and e e and for me. How do you mean?

[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:18.960]
I don't know what they got that from my name is Brick and that is a very that's not a common name, but it's not

[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:24.420]
What is it again? It's a bridge bridge guys would yeah, you know, and I mean it's

[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:27.960]
It's a nice name, but I get I used to get piece by a piece about it

[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:33.580]
He's confusing about that name. Why is that white people did and because they know no one knows my god of everyone

[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:42.440]
Is it Maria or Mary or you know, Cindy or you know very common boy? Very boring. Yeah, no, I mean you can't win either way when you think about it

[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:45.020]
Well, how about if you were the person formerly known as

[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:47.420]
Have a great day

[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.960]
Bye, bye

[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.840]
The person formerly known as T. Waneca

[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:54.420]
Now known as Mary

[00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.980]
Hey, if it was good enough for the Virgin Mary. It's good enough for you. Okay, mister. I mean the man

[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:07.100]
We have an open line in day five six seven oh five. Yeah, that's gonna be the next thing men with women's names and women with men's names

[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.960]
There you go. Yeah, how do you like that?

[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.020]
Was good enough for Ann Bishop

[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.880]
Yeah, her name could have been like in fact

[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.080]
We're not even something if she would have been Dwight Lauderdale

[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.060]
And he could have been Ann or that guy's Jimmy Sifilis could have been Ann

[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:27.560]
Huh? I guarantee that in fact, maybe instead of firing all those people at channel four you guys out of try that

[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:33.940]
How about Brian more cross hey, he could be Ann Roberts and she could be Brian

[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:35.820]
Huh

[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:43.680]
And they could both like exchange garb as well he could dress up like a lot although she don't dress that good anyway

[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:49.820]
She you know, she may she may be very nice person, okay, but she's boring Ann Robert. She brings nothing to the table

[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:52.800]
She brings she doesn't bring appearance. She doesn't bring credibility

[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.420]
She brings nothing and Cam Braille

[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:59.320]
He's the guy that's gonna be sacked because he's got the big lips. They probably did focus studies

[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:05.180]
Okay, and they asked leading they did leading questions. You see you were talking about that the other day about the way they ask these polls

[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.260]
I didn't see 60 minutes. I was on a plane

[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:15.680]
But evidently they did a they had a segment on about how they do the polling and they ask questions in such a leading way as guarantee to get a certain answer

[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.320]
Yeah, they serve it for buzzwords right right exactly

[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.780]
So you know, they probably asked a whole bunch of people well to those big

[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:30.140]
You know Afro-Colonel lips that Cam Braille have to those kind of bother you are they a little bit out of the ordinary and people say

[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:34.300]
Maybe now that you mentioned it and they said okay, you're out Cam Braille

[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:38.380]
Even though you were a good guy and you ever stole a freight train and people are kind of gotten used to you like the furniture

[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.820]
They got a lot worse problems over there like the Jim Berry now. There's a guy

[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:46.860]
I almost put him in the same category with Geldy. That's how annoying he is

[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.120]
Although

[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.240]
See he goes out of his way to do it. Geldy. Geldy. That's just him. He's just an annoying little put and I'm sucking

[01:01:54.240 --> 01:02:00.320]
Quit but Jim Berry he goes out of his way he puts on a whole routine and act and a shuffle to be annoying

[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.320]
Talk about stereotypes

[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.380]
Here's a mobile and bokeh. Hello

[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:11.400]
Okay, sir. I got a quick comment and then I got to answer to your question. Yes

[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:17.300]
Comment is I'm sick of these people with the on the news with these made-up names like beach racing

[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:23.960]
Cinematic and all that crap. Yes, cinnamon sofa. What what's that kind of a name is it sounds like something you find in a freezer department at publics

[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.860]
Yeah, three taught it and also

[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.460]
This channel said about these news places wanted to like get their ratings up

[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:36.320]
Like somebody like walricks and says with all the news which is working and like beat the living crap out of them

[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:43.140]
Yeah, you get a 90 sure we get promoted a week ahead. Yeah, yeah, I would like read that I watch channel seven every day

[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:46.520]
I would too. I would tap it and watch it every morning being a good mood all day

[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.820]
24 hours a day then my answer

[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:53.860]
Is the way that these people get their names like all the crazy names? Yeah

[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.720]
All they do is like the mother

[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:03.800]
Like she sleeps probably a thousand guys. Yeah, she's not sure who the mother is of the baby

[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:08.740]
She just takes the first initial of every guy she's left to jump with it together and it is the name

[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:12.480]
So I think that's probably where Anne from it came from excellent. Okay, good job, sir

[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.440]
So she's not sure who the mother is that's interesting. I thought he was gonna say he's not sure

[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:22.300]
Okay, we have an open line at brown at five six seven oh five 60 and pound five 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:23.600]
I mean what is in the name anyway?

[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:31.840]
There's one thing I can't stand it's phony made up names, you know like neo-rodgers stupid names like that can't stand them

[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:33.960]
Here's my me legs. Hello

[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:39.620]
Dr. Neal. Yes, sir. How are you sir? Great. Uh, you know, I have a quick question. Neal and I you know again

[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:42.500]
I'd like to hear from your religious fanatic audience there

[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:47.760]
Why is it that the flaming racist bigoted people? Why are they so?

[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:51.640]
Yeah, why is it that they're so interreligion? What are they always called the Bible?

[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:58.180]
What do you mean by that? Well, I mean, I just I've come to learn a lot of what else are they're gonna quote Norman Vincent Piel

[01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:02.900]
I mean, that's that's what they used to justify all their superstitions. I mean what a coincidence

[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:06.280]
I mean, you know, you know, they're always all the Bible is pure white Bible that and

[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:12.480]
It's confusing people let our superstitious and tell you don't let a black cat walk in your path and they'll walk under a letter

[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.920]
The same people start quoting from you know, Vincent Price

[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:17.120]
Stuff like that. Oh

[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.980]
See there you go and have a great day

[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:24.120]
We have an open-line update five six seven oh five sixty. It's like people are over obsessed with sports

[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.120]
Those are the people I give you a song in advance about the Jimmy said this and did that and Baba Vipa

[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.140]
And that's all I'm talking about when we're around the clock morning and the night

[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:34.540]
The good news is dog got very good news for people to get in charge of all the crap

[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:38.280]
Including that Edgar rent to rea but what's for Joe Angel gonna do now?

[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:43.660]
He's losing all of his favorite names rent to rea then she just hate the way he used to say that oh god

[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:48.040]
That's fake see it gave you an opportunity to stage more that thickness that he does

[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:51.880]
Which I don't want to get into that again because he's he's okay. They both Brian is great by the way

[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:55.860]
Julangel could be great, but I've said that 50 million times already and he still won't change

[01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:59.860]
He still wants to do fake like a fake orgasm. It just doesn't have the same impact

[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:03.160]
But nevertheless no more Edgar rent to rea

[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.540]
So not only if we got that stuff

[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:07.640]
So we're gonna have a lot more disillusioned people go even though John Henry bought the team

[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:12.040]
You're still gonna get screw and they're still trying to save money no matter what they've done brosky tells you tomorrow no matter how much

[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.260]
sucking around gelbie does

[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:17.720]
Big article in the paper today underneath the one that says cats no trade dominant

[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.680]
Panthers nobody's gonna make no trade with Brian Murray

[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:26.080]
Even Mike Smith at Toronto was anxious as he is and has hated as he despised all around the league

[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.160]
They don't want to make no trade with Brian Murray, okay

[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.720]
Because they know he's the spokesman for our something anyway

[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:34.480]
NHL teams. They're losing money big article here today

[01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:39.480]
Penguin's of course, we know are like an a virgin bankruptcy in fact they are in chapter as some chapter

[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:44.600]
And they hit a bar of 20 million dollars from a french bank and the LA Kings have lost 15

[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:50.340]
They're gonna lose 15 million this year the Vancouver conucks claimed to have lost 24 million the past two years

[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:55.420]
They're watching caps lost 16 million last year and will lose 20 million this season in spite of that big new arena

[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:59.100]
I thought the new arenas were supposed to solve all that problem wasn't that the deal yeah

[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:03.080]
Still the centaurina will make a lot of money and they're still losing the race

[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:12.040]
Mighty ducks general manager Pierre gochie said his club will lose lots of money for the first time in its history this effing year. How do you like that? Oh

[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:21.120]
And it goes on and on Bruins general manager cheap skate hairy sendin says clubs pay NHL clubs pay 72% of their revenues to the players

[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:29.080]
The NBA which has greater TV and merchandising income last season played 57% of its revenues to players and considered that high enough to initiate a lockout

[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:33.040]
In other words, they got real source because they're tied up with this collective bargaining deal

[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:38.960]
The NHL till the year 2004 and many of these teams are losing their rectum. How do you like that?

[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:47.160]
So they can be paying Kevin Brown 15 million a year and at fat ash vovon

[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:50.780]
14 13 million and Mike pizza head 13. I know something

[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:58.000]
It's all come crumbling down like a big deck of hook cards and people are finally saying guess what it wasn't so important after all

[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.040]
Do we really care all that much? No scrum pack them a goddamn stale salami say we give them a guia berra and a stale

[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.420]
Maybe a nojay and send it back where they came from that's that's what I say

[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:13.220]
And then in fact, that's what we're gonna be doing on our pool tomorrow

[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:16.040]
We're gonna find out what kind of a format you think we got a heavier on Q a month

[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.940]
We'll get rid of all the stupid sports crap and it all goes out of business in a few months

[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:25.400]
Huh? Yeah, in fact this now make now I'm beginning to understand why when you're starting the first of the year in mornings on a station

[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:30.180]
What no, I'm beginning to understand they're thinking they see the head writing on the wall

[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:34.160]
They know that all of the sports crap is it's a dissolving right before our eyes. It'll all be done

[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:42.000]
And so as a result we have to look good to the future baby the future the sports is in the past the future is something else like in

[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:42.700]
Uga Buga

[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.260]
26 after 11 to 5 60 WQA and

[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:51.160]
Chocolate can't keep it's packer in his hand the following is a paid public service announcement from the International Ripe Association

[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:56.020]
Let's face most of us will never be rich hell. We probably won't even be successful

[01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:57.580]
And that's pretty damn depressing

[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:01.080]
But as usual with every problem there is a solution

[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:04.760]
Hi, I'm Jim and I'm here to tell you a little something about hand guns

[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.260]
They scared their s*** out of people intimidate them and then giving you whatever you want

[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:16.780]
That's right hand guns think about it need some cash rob a bank don't have enough money for beer or the convenience

[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:21.360]
Take chips and pretzel's wire and it's all free if you've got a handgun

[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:27.340]
Some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend kill him the simple solution a life complex problem

[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:31.520]
All I have to do is wait the five days for it and happiness is just around the corner

[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.180]
Well, if you don't want to wait the five days who cares?

[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:37.560]
Buy the dancing of the street just buy a lot of handgun

[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:41.840]
The great alternative the working problems out and get be considered a population control

[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:45.080]
Yes handgun they just might make your thing

[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:52.580]
Love it's really one at five sixty WQM. I'm sure that the stan and chris are somewhere right now in the QA

[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.860]
I'm fairing to try to raise a lot more money today for center one

[01:08:54.860 --> 01:09:00.360]
I'm sure they must be somewhere like a one-korel springs in corals springs and as soon as we find out where I'll be happy to tell you

[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.680]
You know, I'm going to be a little bit disappointed in this crowd

[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.300]
You know and by the way a special thanks to jolton jodamagio

[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:13.600]
He's the one that instructed the doctors his agent that old far a foggy morris anglberg to cut the crap already

[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:18.900]
Okay, enough of the updates is what he said enough of the frickin update. That's right enough of that too

[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.140]
And so we've been spared for the last day and a half now any more news about his

[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:27.400]
Power movements it about that he take a breath that enough

[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.660]
We don't let us know what's going on when it's over if you know what I mean catch my drift like with Norman fell

[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.860]
But we haven't had one call here today from anybody about a camberal Martian the guy is a good guy

[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:45.260]
From what they tell me never stole a freight train did a lot of work for charity and a lot of our for kids charities

[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:50.620]
Especially big brothers big sisters little brothers little sisters big lips. What are small lips?

[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:55.620]
And he's gonna be blown out over there like he's one of the scapegoats

[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.160]
I'm sure there'll be plenty others follows

[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.900]
So don't slam the door too hard on a way out camberal because there'll be a long line on a way out

[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:05.920]
And they don't care see that this is one stand about it see sometimes

[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.660]
In the moment of weakness. I'll take it personally and then I realize that it's it's not me

[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:13.460]
It's at least they're consistent. They don't care about anybody

[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.120]
They don't have passion for anything here

[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:20.320]
It's like that thing the other day with the uh the business about the hockey fan

[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:26.400]
They don't care they leave whenever they're good and ready they leave don't confuse them with what the score is because they're not paid too much attention anyway

[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.740]
It's a social event and just in case a miracle might occur like three years ago

[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:36.660]
And the team gets lucky or gets a couple of more real players on the team which I doubt

[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:40.820]
But you know in case they became competitive and suddenly got a lucky hot streak for a couple of months

[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:46.020]
Then they leave the option open of jumping on a badwagon get those banners out and putting them under car windows

[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:48.620]
Hey, we love you pass. There's see more fans

[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:55.020]
There's no passion there. There's about as much passion as uh, you know tilting sideways in your chair and

[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:58.380]
Sneaking a little apart. That's all that's the amount of passion that's involved

[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.720]
Which is very unfortunate believe they're consistent. They don't give a crap about cambrill

[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:08.600]
Which is probably why the ratings were so goddamn low and maybe they're happy he's going

[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.900]
Maybe they're happy that he's getting can't i'm not happy

[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.540]
I was just getting used to him. I would and you know something

[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:16.900]
I've been watching him so long now

[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:21.200]
I don't even notice the lips anymore in the beginning when they made him from sports into a news anchor

[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.280]
They took that magic wand like they did with Tony cigarette. Oh, oh pull if you're enough

[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.620]
I did it with a little bright noracross that little twit

[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:31.640]
That little egotistical arrogant twit. Well, I'm not doing the weather anymore. I'll see. Let me be a news anchor

[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.560]
Part of the time. I'll be a news anchor part of the time. I'll be a weather guy and the rest of time. I'll just be a weather fairy

[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.980]
Okay, Brian. Whatever you say just calm down. Okay

[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:45.660]
Here's a bokeh. Hello. Hey the overwire. Yes, sir

[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:52.460]
Getting back to all the other black names. There's somebody who I work with and that was one of the questions that happened to have

[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.420]
asked about two weeks ago. Yeah, the reason why what is your name Latoya?

[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.960]
I actually closed it's like

[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.960]
Sequoia something

[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:08.880]
The other reason is that they can offer their kids too much

[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:13.340]
But the one thing that they can offer them is a exotic name

[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:19.740]
And that's the reason you do what does that mean? I don't mean they can't offer their kids too much

[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:23.660]
What does that mean? I have no idea. Okay. Thank you

[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:28.460]
Okay, we we're living in poverty. We're in the ghetto

[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:32.340]
But we we're gonna give you a real fancy name so everybody can make fun of you at school

[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:39.760]
Huh, I don't get it that key Sean of all the names of all the goofy names even the ones that are spelled like hzkq

[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.960]
Even though that key Sean there's something about it

[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:47.180]
Maybe because he's you know a prominent player and a pretty damn good one too by the way even though it does play for the untruth

[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:54.640]
But Keeshawn is there just something about it that has the sound of a literacy attached to it isn't there? Hey Keeshawn

[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.620]
What what kind of a name is that?

[01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.320]
Keeshawn

[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:04.960]
Now Shaqiala is bad enough. Okay, but at least you can say I've been having a shack attack

[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:10.300]
You know there's things that rhyme with it. Is there anything that rhymes with Keeshawn? No, it's in doc. How about dog on Keeshawn?

[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:13.500]
There you go that dog on Keeshawn burn us again god dang it

[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:20.440]
Keeshawn it just oh I get the creeps I get the willies I don't know if I feel uncomfortable even saying it

[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:23.680]
Thinking it I even get like a little bit nervous but saying it

[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.060]
Here's Margate hello

[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:32.140]
Hey, no, yes, sir. I got a real pet theme of these malls forget about these names

[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.060]
I know what it is about these malls that seems like every year you go through for Christmas season

[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.260]
Uh-huh

[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:40.660]
I

[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:44.800]
The people that walk erect

[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:50.160]
You can't see any erections in those places, but you're hanging out in the wrong joint. Okay. We'll give you some addresses

[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.800]
We have an open line in Broward to and day nobody cares about Cambrill before I leave here at two o'clock today

[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:00.700]
That's my goal. I want to hear somebody say something nice about Cambrill Martian god damn it the holiday season

[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:04.780]
If you can't if you can't think of something nice to say about Cambrill make something up

[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:10.920]
Make something up even if you don't know who that was who it is who would be just make something up and say well

[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.520]
He was an okay guy

[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:18.060]
Boy you people are a bunch of tight-ass his man you really are very ungiving

[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:22.940]
So what's the story with our boys out there where you find out where the hell they are it's Chris

[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.400]
It's just Chris and the new

[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:31.700]
Promotions guy. He's name is Keesney. Yeah, we don't care about the names. Okay. I mean there's everybody's trying to find an appropriate corner

[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:35.120]
Jesus like you know by the time he gets going this is part of the problem

[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.640]
We appreciate the help this is great

[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:41.000]
But there's such slow starters with this crap by the time they get to wherever we're going to show us half over

[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.120]
And we cut down the limited demand you know amount of time people have to get there people are busy

[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.300]
They're shopping or schlepping. They're working. They do whatever they're supposed to be doing. They're pretending to have a life

[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:55.180]
And by the time they ever finger it out or get their finger out of each other's record. No, the show's half over already

[01:14:55.180 --> 01:15:00.600]
It's almost noon already if we heard from Carol at center one. Oh, I'm trying to be like the pied piper here

[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:05.580]
I'm trying like to get this you know, and we had some real serious momentum going here

[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:12.080]
We got like right right up to 86 grand there plus so whatever else came in at those seven borders

[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:18.600]
We might actually be up to a close to 90 grand by now for all I know or not as the case may be that internet thing the arigis.com

[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:19.340]
How's that doing

[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.420]
We got like I said about 250 bucks in the mail this morning, which isn't exactly a flood

[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:29.660]
It's not exactly like those 50 billion letters out there that want to win that pickup truck from that tailgate contest

[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:30.320]
We got going

[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:36.500]
But at least it's something and we thank you profusely by the way and yes, I will be at the hockey game tomorrow night for the Pittsburgh game

[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:44.240]
And by the way fat ass Michael Russo wouldn't surprise me if stew barn plays in that game along with Marty Strocka for Pittsburgh tomorrow night

[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.780]
You better hope they sure don't do too much. Okay, after that idiotic will stew

[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:51.800]
But with Chris Wells be playing for the Panthers. No, I don't think so last time I checked

[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:58.000]
Here's Coral Springs hello. Yeah, this is oral spring. Neil. How do I get? Okay great show today

[01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:05.520]
Listen at borders it's a 700 university drive and Coral Springs right on the corner of Atlantic Boulevard. Yeah, I miss it

[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:09.760]
And that's the address. I think that's what you guys wanted when you let me know when you guys gonna be

[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:11.340]
What do you mean? No, they're not going to borders

[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:16.600]
Why should they pick the van to borders when the CDs are already there? If people want to go to the borders

[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:20.180]
They can you I mean we're trying to go to a location where other people might be you see what I'm saying

[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:22.180]
Okay, like a gas station in the major intersection

[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:25.960]
Okay, well, I'm gonna go pick that CD up over there that borders and that

[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:32.180]
That um, I guess maybe it's a Muslim name I'm the too short. Well, I'll be more they call them Machmuda Abdul Raouf

[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:34.140]
Yeah, I like that Machmuda

[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:38.200]
I feel it's a machmuda. Hey, I have a great day his brother by the way is named Mach Nell

[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:46.180]
Okay 21 before noon at 560. We have an open line in Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:51.120]
Norman fellers that is anybody care about that? No, anybody know who he was. No, he was in the graduate

[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.940]
He was in at what what was the sitcom? He was on three-escalogy. I hated that

[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.640]
Oh, I hate all those shows

[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:04.060]
Even good times. Oh, sorry Esther. We love best of roll, but we hated good times probably because of that damn JJ

[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:08.680]
Boy he was just and impediment to my life

[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.440]
21 before noon at 560 WQM

[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:19.640]
Last year Jody Foster portrayed a young woman determined to see justice done in the accused

[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:25.620]
All right talk which one of you get it this year she won critical acclaim for her portrayal of an F.D. I agent

[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:28.940]
I'm a pretty little vicious killer in the sidelines of the lands

[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:36.740]
Was it all of you? Why won't you answer me now Jody Foster combines her two greatest roles into one blockbuster movie

[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:42.380]
Dan I'm why won't you talk to her name try star pictures presents but silence of the accused land

[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:47.440]
Guard get them out of here. They won't talk too late you head your chance

[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:51.600]
Assignments of the accused land a tale of murder and a mutton

[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:58.420]
16 till known at 560 WQM poor Jody Foster. You know what she had that baby and we still can't find out how it happened

[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.760]
Maybe it's the virgin Jody you ever stop and think about that uh huh

[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:06.680]
No, seriously that there's never been any discussion about whether she was artificially inseminated

[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:12.040]
Which were positive she was by the way and but but there's no discussion about that because in America today

[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:15.600]
It doesn't really make no difference in T because if you're in Hollywood or if you're a jock

[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:21.620]
You have a bunch of babies by a bunch of different people by a bunch of different methods and uh then that way nobody's responsible

[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.220]
Anything's don't quite work out you put the baby in like a peach oven

[01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:30.280]
Or you dump it down the toilet at the you're senior prom or something like that and then we go on with life and have a good time

[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:35.300]
Here's a mobile in North Miami. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes

[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.540]
I know what my favorite part of that movie was

[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.420]
I've silenced the lamp and the previous

[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.240]
No, forget about that, but okay

[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:48.540]
She's sitting there at the end he hangs up for like three minutes and she's in there doctor

[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:53.400]
Dr. Lecdor yeah, right you know and there's like a dial tone and a reorder and everything

[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:53.860]
uh

[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.820]
Usually when you hear the dial tone you don't keep speaking to it, but poor Jody she's confused in many ways

[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:03.860]
It was embarrassing the other thing that that's that's that you're playing

[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:07.780]
It was the lotion and the basket. Yeah, you mean that one?

[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:15.440]
Yeah, I'm gonna try to do this without cracking up, but about it puts the he cool in the casket

[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:20.760]
Oh boy. Okay. Thanks for the good news. Okay. That's buddy mcay doing a little bit of that southern a bump in humor

[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:22.400]
These are kind of chuckle

[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:28.160]
We have an open line. Yeah, that's right. That's why you'd be very careful the paul bears is a funeral because if you drop it

[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.600]
It puts too much motion in the casket

[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:34.060]
We have an open line of day five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the estate

[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:38.000]
At least there are things like a biscuit a task it. I'll see in your casket stuff like that

[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.940]
But kishon there ain't nothing that rhymes with kishon

[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:45.460]
Except uh get long gone and dog gone and stuff like that

[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.680]

Oh Jay. We don't name our pizogia. We'll say that white sags like you. Yeah

Okay, and have a happy holiday too by the way

[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:46.440]

[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:58.500]
But I mean just what hey, Tayy how you doing, Tayy? What?

[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:06.920]

[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:15.400]

He used to be on a CBS station channel three up in Hartford years and years ago. Yeah, no bad guy

[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.800]
He's not a bad guy and you're absolutely right about that Ann Roberts

[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:42.000]
A friend of mine. He adds absolutely nothing to that newscast. She's just yeah

[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.200]
She is as wooden and sterile as the inside of an oxygen tent

[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:52.000]
Yeah, I mean I knew somebody that was on the weather staff over there that just left a few months ago to Denver one of the he was like the third

But I say assistant to the weather for oh, okay

[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:04.380]
Television down here in general just like radio is terrible awful

[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:11.200]
Absolutely if it's in just perfectly it's bush leaks and the amazing part of this there's so much money involved there and

[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.580]
It's no bush league. I

[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:17.520]
Beyond me now can bro used to do sports in Connecticut. What the heck Tony's the Greta

[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.460]
Now all the guys they started a sport and they started a sports readers and then they become newsreads

[01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:28.460]
Steve Alvarez same thing and then they put these weather people like the most devalver as he on ten right?

[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:33.720]
I don't watch ten okay, but then there's been some weather people like Theresa Martietta and the girl

[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:36.020]
I channel ten so yes, I

[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.040]
You know

[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.900]
People that were doing the weather that now they've got them doing news I

[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:45.660]
What's the story with this Maryland Mitchell with the cat eyes? What about okay?

[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:50.580]
All right, the name is that Mitchell I can't I can't watch her at all cat eyes. I cannot watch her

[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:55.620]
I find myself watching see is one of the most gruesome grotesque caricatures of a human being

[01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:59.020]
I've ever seen in my life and she's on the news on there and now well

[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:02.300]
I wonder Rick Sanchez has always laughing and squeezing somebody under the desk

[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:08.420]
I find myself watching CNN and headline news more often than not now there was the girl that was on channel seven down here

[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:13.480]
I went by the name cinnamon stopher right now. She's on headline news and the more she's doing very well

[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:18.000]
Now she's going by her middle name, which is we saw or whatever all of a sudden cinnamon ain't cute

[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.320]
So I mean she grew up and you know I'm still for like I said it looks like something you find right next to the set right in the middle of the

[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:25.980]
Surley baked goods your I'd be alright once one thing about

[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:30.560]
My house to the lambs when I when I went to see that movie whenever came out nine years eight years ago

[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.300]
Whatever it was my friend says to me we got to go to this movie

[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:40.540]
I had no idea what it was after the first maybe five or six minutes of the movie. Yeah, not a single person in the theater

[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:46.660]
Move nobody got up to the lotion in the basket. Yeah, nobody got up for sodas. Nobody got to go to the bathroom

[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:49.920]
I had no idea what the movie was about. I just sat there and stared at it

[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.720]
I was like that was one of the greatest movies of all time

[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:58.880]
Well, you're getting a little bit carried away. No, it was good. It was entertaining. Yeah, I mean for I thought that thing you would watch over and over and over and over again

[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:02.640]
No, no, I mean unless you were studying insects or something like that

[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:07.260]
Hey, look at my favorite my favorite greatest movie of all time was cost the block. I don't watch that old

[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:13.220]
Not okay inside out. I thought Casablanque was the greatest wall time a big marshmallow span too

[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:18.660]
But out of the last 10 15 years final civil amazigh I'd be wanting to pay me to top 10 movies of the last 10 15 years

[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:20.400]
Have a great holiday. Hey, care. Bye-bye

[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:24.560]
Well, he liked Casablanque too. He liked those corny, humpy boogard movies

[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:27.760]
You must remember this so chicken cannot

[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.100]
Okay, we have an open line in power. It's 5 6 7 0 5 60 pot

[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.700]
0 5 60 on it wasn't that funny George

[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:37.140]
0 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:42.640]
Yeah, I think those kind of things to myself on the shower by the way when there's absolutely nobody else even the dogs are outside

[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:46.540]
Because I'm not what you call a great zinger key. I'm not you know

[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:50.280]
But I do sing some very twisted because I have a sick mind and I'm very proud of it

[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:50.840]
I'm very pleased

[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:56.200]
That's what's got me to wear am today having a very sick twisted mind and I'm one of the few who admits it and proud of it right

[01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:01.940]
That's why as soon as I hear somebody's name I'm thinking what can you be ramen with that? Okay?

Merry Christmas and happy new year and all that it's already December the 15th and

[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:37.020]
Chris and Lou by the way I never even gave this information for Christrick and so wrapped up with this

[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:38.380]
Silence of the Amos business

[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:44.420]
Chris and Lou and a wqn van there at the Chevron station on the southeast corner of university and world pond and

[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:50.040]
prestigious coral springs go over there and pick up your best in the LCDs and cassettes and t-shirts and they got a few giveaways

[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:54.940]
They got maybe some dolphin t-shirts and a few chatskeys to give away in our DNA bumper stickers and whatever else

[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:56.100]
They got laying around loosen there

[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:57.380]
Stan is not with them today

[01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:00.740]
He's probably a mess in around with some of the onkers he picked up yesterday at hooters

[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.320]
So he's otherwise occupied today

[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.580]
So you'll have to settle for Chris and Lou

[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:12.060]
But they're in their university and roll palm on a southeast corner there in the Chevron station go over there and help us raise some serious money in the next couple of hours

[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.340]

Here's a coral gable. Hello

[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:17.820]
Hello Neil. Yes, sir

[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:24.460]
Uh, you were talking about the names and Norman fell passing yeah, he once played a character called Meyer Meyer

[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.140]
On a TV show called 87th precinct you need to go

[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:31.620]
I'm set for redundancy. Hi

[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:37.320]
And uh, I just thought I'd add that in there. Uh-huh

[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:41.720]
And then on the other thing about uh, aren't you glad that we're not hearing about you to measure your last couple of days?

[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:45.040]
I feel a lot better about life that we don't have to be brilliant with them

[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:52.440]
And I'm old enough to have actually seen Joe DiMaggio, but I was at a ballpark to see Hoppe Long Cassidy 1951 William Boyd

[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:56.880]
That's right. And guess what he's dead to he's dead too. Yeah, who else is dead?

[01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:59.220]
Well, Gabby Hayes Gabby Hayes

[01:27:59.220 --> 01:27:59.820]
Yep

[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:06.280]
They're all going he was on that show right? I'm the hoppy hoppe long Cassidy. Yep. They was he was a sidekick. He's dead

[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:11.620]
Yeah, and the horse is dead too. That's right. He's dead too. So it's going around pal. Good point

[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:16.960]
Okay, we have an open line in day five six seven oh fuck. Oh by the way, did you know that I guess we all knew this

[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:19.720]
Will Geer was grandpa on the Walten's

[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:25.560]
Who the hell was that reading that because I read I got this awful book which I thought it was gonna be really good book

[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:31.160]
About the fags in Hollywood which I read over the weekend on the plane which was I'll think of the name but in a minute

[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.980]
Can't think of the name but but anyway, don't waste your money on the move on the book

[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:41.480]
Because you know, there's nothing in it. There's no revelations anybody that's still alive. They like uh, you know

[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:44.480]
They dance all around the edges because they're terrified of getting sued

[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:48.740]
So there's really no revelation there, but will Geer he was a screamer

[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:53.460]
Did you know that and I'm trying to think of who it was that was it him and Charles Lawton was that who it might have been

[01:28:54.940 --> 01:29:00.060]
Huh and poor Elsa Lancaster that married big fat Charles Lawton. She couldn't understand why he kept her under my mind with all those boys

[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:04.420]
Anyway, 1156 if I she was in denial, you know like a lot of people are in denial

[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:08.680]
But that's the way the world is okay. That's it was good enough for free a packer. It's good enough for them

[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:10.480]
They spend their entire lives in denial

[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:16.620]
By the way, how's the richie now is the one four minutes before noon at five sixty wqm

[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:48.580]
Hello to five sixty wqm happy Tuesday to don't forget handkerchief

[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:52.180]

Ed Kaplan throw all you compulsive gamblers tonight. We'll try to help you find the numbers for GA ten o'clock tonight

[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:02.820]
So what's the story the facts machine is not working is that it?

[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:04.720]
It seems like

[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.340]
Hey somebody send a fact

[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:11.980]
You've heard all the expressions about you know trying to overcome hurdles obstacles in your path

[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:16.640]
And it seems like I'm a center one thing here this year. It's like every every little thing that you try to do

[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:21.140]
When you feel like you really start to make some big progress. There's another hurdle placed in our path

[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:25.020]
You know so we can overcome all these obstacles and make us feel really

[01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:26.900]
A lot better about the whole deal

[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:32.580]
Oh, I guess Carol could probably call you if she has any more information about the border stores from last week

[01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:37.400]
So we can give like a really updated total which is probably like about 87 88,000 something like that

[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:42.420]
And how is Chris and Lou doing out there by the way in Coral Springs on the yourself? What is it?

[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:43.680]

[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:44.720]

[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:50.960]
On the corner of university and rural palm the southeast corner in the chevron station in Coral Springs

[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.920]
There's nobody there nobody's coming by to buy the best of the old stuff up there in Coral Springs

[01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:59.740]
Like I said, they hate me in pepper pines and Coral Springs they hate me like poison

[01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:02.820]
Dismount there's nobody coming by

[01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:06.400]
Yeah, there's the one guy in Coral Springs is

[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:21.560]

[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:25.300]
There's plenty of people driving by but nobody coming in well

[01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:28.280]
I just got there like a few minutes ago. This we go through this every day

[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.740]
You don't understand that the people in the media neighborhood out there

They weren't just kind of sitting around in their cars waiting for uh sent for Dave this year for uh christmas show up

Yeah, but it's all painted nice and the the names all over it. I mean you can't miss it right

[01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:43.620]
Even Ray Charles could find it okay

[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:47.340]
Full of your man. Give him some cash in to help us out and thank you so much in advance

[01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:52.440]
So there's the bad news. Okay, there's the one guy he's looking right at the QA and van right now at chris and lu

[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:56.220]
They're sitting there. They're lonely. They're waiting. They got the best of the old stuff. They got CDs

[01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:59.180]
They got cassettes. They got t-shirts. They got all kinds of crap

[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:05.040]
And we're waiting for our listeners to come pouring in there from all around that area

[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:10.560]
Are they pouring in there yet? No you mark my words by 1230 will have at least

[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:11.740]

[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:17.760]
See we the the first couple of days boy we really got uh snowed by this crowd

[01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:20.520]
We really got a snow job. We thought oh boy

[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:25.240]
This is gonna be a piece of cake every day no matter what part of time we go into we'll be able to raise you know

[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:28.340]
800 a grand here 1500 over there 12 no problem

[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:31.860]
We're instead of waiting for the people to come to us. We'll just go to them is what we're doing

[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:35.540]
Found out yesterday ain't quite so easy

[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.900]
Here's Miami. Hello, hi Neil. Yes, sir

[01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:44.180]
Yeah, Rocky raisin and I got a couple of email addresses together in case if there's anybody out there in your audience who

[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:47.440]
Would like to write to the undecided representatives

[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:53.360]
Because um to travesty and rocky's gonna be going up there on Thursday be with with um Jesse Jackson

[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:56.440]
They're gonna do some kind of a protest upfront. Yeah the capital

[01:33:57.060 --> 01:34:00.800]
So do you want these address sure? I guess so I mean it doesn't seem to be doing too much good

[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:06.840]
I read that whole thing in the paper this morning that 80 and 90% of the calls are all saying no impeachment and these people are still

[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:13.080]
Whatever you say we'll do the opposite you know, okay, go ahead. Okay. It's www.house.gov

[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:18.520]
And the second one is HTTP colon slash slash congress

[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:22.120]
dot org slash elek mail

[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:22.940]
ELEC

[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:28.940]
Yeah, that HTML. No, I think the first ones a lot easier. Yeah, you can go to the first one too

[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:32.260]
www.house.gov. Yeah

[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:34.540]
Gov right okay

[01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:40.300]
I think this is a travesty. I think it's really unfortunate and people don't understand the severity of what's gonna happen

[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:44.100]
They're they're in La La land. They're too busy worrying about the Hanukkah gift you know, okay, pal

[01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:45.320]
All right, no, no, no, no, thanks

[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:49.560]
Okay, we have an open line today. They're too busy worried about the you know that they get the affirming

[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:55.040]
Dolls for the kid and then they get this and then they get laid and whatever they got what we got we got

[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:56.580]
We got that's what they're worried about what they got

[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:00.100]
And what you're about to get is screwed is what you're about to get because

[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:05.160]
We got a bunch of lunatics up there in Washington including that Rosanne Rosanne down at Iliana gross latin

[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:06.720]
Why don't even bother talking to her?

[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:09.540]
I mean she admits that she's getting overwhelming

[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:14.620]
People calling and saying no no one impeachment. Well, she's gonna have to make the vote and she's I know

[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:19.740]
She's gonna alienates and people but she's a good right wing and I see and never met a faster. She didn't like it

[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:22.280]
Okay, whatever you say Rosanne

[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:29.380]
Gilda Radner is turning in her grave just knowing that Iliana gross latin is walking around the looking and acting like that

[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:34.860]
And she don't even have to put on act to do it. Here's for Lauderdale. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir

[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:36.360]
two things first

[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:41.840]
I'm really sat in here. The Norman fell is now has been canceled. He's dead. Yes

[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:46.620]
He's that's right. It's yours been canceled permanently. Yes. I remember he was a good character actor

[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:47.840]
He was he was in

[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:54.260]
In that movie mad mad mad mad mad mad mad mad world. Yeah, like a right in the beginning

[01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:59.000]
Really interesting seeing him all in the graduate like I said before yes

[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:05.200]
But he's now an ex actor I guess he's a man Hollywood heaven and

[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.120]
As for

[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:15.040]
What is it as you were talking about the violence of the lambs? Yeah as great as the movie is as it was the book was much better

[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:22.860]
Really really and so was the first Hannibal actor book red red dragon dragon. I read that yeah. Yeah, that's that book kept me up

[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:29.220]
So as people should go out and read the books and maybe Thomas Adams will write a third how

[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:34.280]
Hannibal led to love me as look ask you one question. Sure. What is a buffalo tail

[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:42.360]
Okay, we have an open line in the Broward 5 6 7 0 5 I think we stepped him on that one 5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 and a mobile one line

[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:44.240]
95 dollars

[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:49.020]
Yeah, they've only been there a few minutes usually by this time they call and say 20 bucks

[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:52.100]
We'll get some people out there just be patient. They'll keep moving around

[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:56.980]
They'll keep running away just every time they start driving to where we are then they keep running away

[01:36:56.980 --> 01:37:00.540]
Just because I said something okay pay no attention to me. Just stay where you are

[01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:05.600]
They have plenty of dolphin shirts to give away to give away to anyone who make the money

[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:08.820]
Anybody makes a donation to center one you get a dolphin that t-shirt

[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:14.320]
We got tons of those to give away which is great and we got tons of a neo merchandise to help raise money for center one today

[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:19.760]
We'll get several hundred bucks up there in coral springs. Well, no why we're talking people with some serious money up there

[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:23.120]
Okay, and coral springs. That's right. We're not talking about shleppers up there

[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.560]
We're talking about people who probably have too much goddamn money. Give us some of it to us all right

[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.440]
It's tax deductible if you're that cheap

[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:37.420]
Man, oh man, you have to really prod these bastards Chevron station southeast corner university and world palm and prestigious

[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:42.840]
Coral Springs in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if even river goes by there makes an extra donation

[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:46.580]
Plus the big check he's gonna give me at the hockey game tomorrow night. Anybody believe that? No

[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:52.240]
Now talk to me today said by the way you were right about the decimal point the thing you didn't understand is there all zeros on there

[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:54.660]
Before and after the decimal point

[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:59.600]
But he said it'll look really good my handing you a check people really believe there's some money in it

[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:04.700]
Nine minutes after noon at five sixty wq and we want to bang you in the butt honey

[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:07.560]
Okay

[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:12.880]
By the park

[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:15.520]
Deadly park

[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:17.900]
Heaven

[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:19.840]
Yo

[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:20.980]
�

[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:22.700]
Stop

[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:43.340]
Just

[01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:48.460]
I was part

[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:51.540]
Gagley part

[01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:54.680]
I got one

[01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:57.060]
And came

[01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:03.460]
I watched a woman's death swim around

[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:09.560]
She was tearing a terrible crown

[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:14.460]
I walked right out of that place

[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:20.640]
With a face pile on my face

[01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:24.660]
Dying with parts

[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:27.620]
Gagley part

[01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:31.000]
You and I

[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.740]
Is wide and arse

[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:36.800]
Last one go

[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:39.660]
But don't look back

[01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:45.500]
At the distance of your gapest eyes

[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:49.940]
If you're in church when you do

[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:56.760]
You'll have to stay in your doom

[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:03.500]
In number you talk today at Phineas

[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:07.000]
But it's the sun, I want to know who cuts the cheese

[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:09.000]
1215 at 560 WQM

[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.540]
I guess the people in the audience like to

[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:12.860]
Really a dollop

[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:14.820]
And put on the big suit, the zoot suit

[01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:16.460]
Maybe they even like those black tie affairs

[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:17.820]
And the tie and the whole deal

[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:19.140]
Every time they go out to eat

[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:21.180]
I made that comment before and I'll stand by it

[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:23.280]
Okay, I appreciate going anywhere in the world

[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.160]
See up north down the south

[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.220]
It's a much more leisurely and casual thing

[01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:29.180]
When you go to Hawaii it's like that

[01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:31.720]
I guess anywhere where the weather is warm

[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:35.380]
Up north like in New York or Chicago where we're destroyed

[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:37.640]
There are tremendous number of restaurants

[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:39.180]
Where a guy goes in without a jacket

[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:41.460]
Or maybe in some cases a jacket and a tie

[01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:44.460]
They say all starry but see you later

[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:48.220]
And I would say okay I'll see you later

[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:50.220]
In fact I won't see you later blow it out your ass

[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:50.940]
It's what I would say

[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:53.860]
It's like people that look at talk about the Phineas Vegas

[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:55.480]
The Phineas many of them are very good

[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:56.320]
And they're great values

[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.580]
But is it worth standing in line for like an hour and a half

[01:40:58.580 --> 01:40:59.800]
Two hours for they get a buffet?

[01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:00.740]
No, of course not

[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:02.420]
You got to be some kind of a jerk

[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:04.480]
Look at all the money you could be losing during that time

[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:07.660]
Here's a mobile and crawl spring

[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:08.080]
Hello

[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:09.220]
How you doing, Neil?

[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:09.560]
Great

[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:10.760]
This is Pete

[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:12.660]
I just was going by there

[01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:14.300]
I bought your best of Neil Partue

[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:16.080]
God bless you Pete, thanks for you

[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:18.440]
I got my free Duff and Steach shirt

[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.660]
Right, is there anybody there?

[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:21.700]
Oh yeah, there's next future seven people

[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:23.860]
Alright, it's starting to build up some big momentum

[01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:24.740]
There we go

[01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:27.360]
Yeah, so everybody get up and maybe access and search

[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:28.900]
Or maybe some money for a big cause

[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:30.220]
Especially up there in crawl springs

[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:32.000]
Where all those people got two damn much money

[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:32.760]
That's their problem

[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.080]
Yeah, I'm a service tech

[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:34.960]
Tell me about it

[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:36.320]
I used to have people over here

[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:38.220]
There were three and four hundred thousand out of houses

[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:38.580]
Right

[01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:40.080]
And also get their needs as well

[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:42.220]
And start generating some money for a big cause

[01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:43.360]
Okay, thanks a lot Pete

[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:44.320]
Alright, Neil

[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.060]
And have a happy

[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:46.020]
Alright, my

[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:47.900]
There's Pete, he helped us out

[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:49.260]
Christian Lou, they're waiting for you

[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:50.620]
We got 155 bucks

[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:53.160]
That's record breaking, this early, this early on

[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:56.760]
And they'll stay there until we get ten grand there today is what they said

[01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:59.040]
Now with Chris said, he said, we're going to stick around here

[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:00.500]
No, we get 50 grand or else

[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:03.260]
No, seriously, don't get a grand

[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:05.120]
I mean, no problem, it's only 12, 15 million

[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:07.180]
I forgot about it there for a few minutes

[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:09.280]
Because they're out so overwhelmed with all these great names

[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:10.700]
These African-er names that we got

[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:13.080]
Like Cuente Quente or whatever that was

[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:15.400]
Now when you come right down a way

[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:17.320]
Wouldn't it be something if we fought out the people in Africa

[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:19.180]
Like in Zaire and in Namibia

[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:21.200]
All those places over there

[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:23.080]
If their names were like, you know, Ed

[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:24.640]
Huh?

[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:27.300]
Like Nelson Mandela

[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:29.640]
If it's good enough for him, it's good enough for me

[01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:32.760]
I knew a guy from Ghana, Africa

[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:35.000]
And his name was Tom, his name was Michael

[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.440]
Michael, how do you like that? Michael, Michael, motorcycle, how do you like that?

[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.600]
It's good enough for some guy from where from Botswana

[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:44.400]
Okay

[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:46.600]
Some guy from Brooklyn

[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:48.920]
I knew a guy from Brooklyn once his name was Michael

[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.520]
If it's good enough for him, he was white

[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:51.560]
Italian, I think

[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:53.420]
Here's a mobile in Weston, hello

[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:55.680]
Hey, how you doing now?

[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:58.700]
Great, I was watching Kenneth Frequency last night

[01:42:58.700 --> 01:42:59.620]
Are you the one, huh?

[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:03.180]
We had a gold scene on there

[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:07.380]
He sleeps with you and you leave 200 bucks on the bed when you're done

[01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:09.720]
That's at a little repeat of all his fantasies

[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:10.440]
Yeah, he only wishes

[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:14.860]
Anyways, I'll make an addiction area for ebonyx

[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:17.280]
We can decide what their names mean

[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.780]
Okay, thank you for all the big hits for us

[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:20.620]
Okay, just anywhere

[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:22.380]
That's a gay club you moron

[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:23.360]
Yeah, that can't be a frequency

[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:25.260]
By the way, that's Wami's, that's still on the ears

[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:27.660]
Anybody know about it? No, no, we don't know, forget about it

[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:29.000]
Open line of day one of Bryan

[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.360]
And by the way, did not get the check for last week from Wami yet

[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.760]
Which is Tuesday already of this week

[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:35.160]
I do understand it's the holidays, but let's get with it

[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:36.300]
Okay, boys over there

[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:39.380]
What an operation that turned out to be

[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:44.020]
That was one of the most astonishing, amazing experiences of my pathetic life

[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.100]
Here's Wami, hello

[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:47.040]
Hey Neil

[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:49.440]
Yes sir, I have the best after-cruiner name for you

[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:49.800]
Yeah

[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:51.960]
Two poxia courts, what do you think of him?

[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:53.600]
Two poxia courts, yeah

[01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:58.380]
Isn't that the best, and about the best movie of the last 10 years?

[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:00.040]
It's uh...

[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:01.120]
What was the name two pox, shikr?

[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:03.760]
Shikr, I think is what they say

[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:04.860]
Up, I don't know

[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:08.560]
So my grandmother always used to say, shikr, was a two-pack or a six-pack

[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:11.000]
That guy was saying the last movie in the last 10 years?

[01:44:11.220 --> 01:44:11.380]
Yeah

[01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:12.280]
Saving Private Ryan

[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:14.080]
What is it?

[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:15.360]
Saving Private Ryan

[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:18.440]
Saving Private Ryan was the best movie of the last 10 years?

[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:19.600]
Yeah, have you seen it?

[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:19.920]
No

[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:21.860]
I'll take your word for it, thanks

[01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:26.320]
Was that as good as pubic pulp fiction?

[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:29.980]
Don't get me started on that again, please, okay?

[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:32.660]
And by the way, did you know that they put mayonnaise on their fries?

[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:36.880]
They take off their ties, and they put mayo on their fries

[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:39.340]
I like to put that to music, okay?

[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:43.200]
In Amsterdam, before they light up their weed and pick out the seed

[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:45.420]
That's right

[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:48.760]
In fact, that's the one place where they don't say hold the mayo

[01:44:49.160 --> 01:45:02.240]

but they they're in little blue boxes and they're real hard chocolates real hard

[01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:43.160]
because in Italy they like it real hard and poor those great

[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:46.460]
and they wouldn't be nearly as good because i'm taking them out of there and left them

[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:50.380]
you know sitting and then they get lukewarm not nearly as good but when they're really good and hard

[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:52.740]
man are they good and the chocolates aren't bad either

[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:56.880]
okay let's go to bouquet hello hey Daniel great

[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:00.260]
on a student at the marginal public university in bouquet here

[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.180]
and we have an African-American student government president and he insists

[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:10.380]
whatever his name is in print it'd be in all lowercase letters because that is his slave name

[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:14.280]
the name the white man gave him oh my god what what do his name be

[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:19.000]
well his first name his first name is Presley in fact so that was quite a museum

[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.180]
and his last name is Elvis not quite his name is Presley

[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:29.000]
and that's the name that the that's his slave name that's what he says

[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.040]
right now I bet he hangs out with David J. Neel in this very time over the

[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:37.940]
hill probably okay thanks for doing that so how to Elvis okay Presley has just left

[01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:42.860]
the building his slave name see I mean if you're going to live with some kind of

[01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:46.300]
a complex it's like if every bag wants to call himself Bruce okay

[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:50.300]
now what's a good bull-like name I don't know are there such things as besides

[01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:53.460]
books that's that's not a real name well there's always books Davis

[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:58.840]
all the masculine and it masculinity feminine names like Bobby for Barbara

[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:06.520]
yeah how about Tommy Pat for Patricia how about Tommy we have yeah see

[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:09.460]
and there gets to be a point now there are people who are like their name is Robert

[01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:12.960]
and when they're young they're Bobby okay and as they get to be like what

[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:16.700]
what would be the demarcation point I think after you get out of high now even in

[01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:21.100]
high school you don't want to be Bobby well maybe I depend on who you are and

[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:24.920]
what you're all about but after you leave high school I would think like when you

[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:28.040]
go off to college you're going to the real world you don't want to be Bobby you

[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:33.380]
want to be Bob just like if your name is Tommy I mean Thomas you know when you're

[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:36.800]
a kid you can be Tommy but when you grow up like when you get to be past the age

[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:41.020]
of you know when you have like a few pubic here's Tom kind of like is a little

[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:46.560]
more appropriate you know who I'm thinking about I'm sure you do it don't be

[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:51.200]
knocking my good friend Tommy okay that came by shows their in Pepper Pines Tommy

[01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:31.320]
to speak Spanish or any language he doesn't want to because his money speaks for

[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:38.040]

who's who's name and who's name in their kids Harley except a lot of guys want to why to Harley

[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:14.200]

short period time because she was getting older by the second so thought she was so great they

[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:44.820]
decided to uh bring her back that is unbelievable I mean she is so grotesque looking and the other

[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:48.520]

Sham God he was he was akin to damn god damn god what what is it what is up with that what is

[01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:31.080]
up with it is that they're the the the more that people are in the sports the dumber they tend to be

[01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:34.900]
the more fanatical air the more idiotic and they will accept any kind of crap no matter how

[01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:39.160]
moronic it is so these jocs can get away with the stuff and people will obediently call them

showbiz purposes like some other sponies but what what what is the statement that you're making

[02:20:39.650 --> 02:20:43.530]
southeast corner university in rural Palm and Coral Springs which I've said at least two three

[02:20:43.530 --> 02:20:49.330]
billion times just in last hour and twenty minutes now find it we got over a thousand bucks already

[02:20:49.330 --> 02:20:54.250]
they must be fine in it they're looking for it okay they got out their spyglass they'd be looking for

[02:20:54.250 --> 02:20:58.910]
it southeast corner university in rural Palm and Coral Springs just look for the big QA in Van it's all

[02:20:58.910 --> 02:21:04.590]
you know dolly up like a piece of stone here's a mirror mar hello hi how you doing great

[02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:12.410]
I'm here a lot of races undertones with the you know the names today undertones yeah I mean what does

[02:21:12.410 --> 02:21:17.810]
that mean I'm just hearing a lot of negative a negative a lot of negative feedback with these names

[02:21:17.810 --> 02:21:22.490]
well I think that that's the point of this whole thing is that those kind of names create a lot of

[02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:28.750]
device of this I mean I know I know what's the point of coming up with these crazy nonconventional names

[02:21:28.750 --> 02:21:34.330]
what's the point because I'm black and I think a lot of people named the truth these names to

[02:21:34.330 --> 02:21:42.970]
spread the different you know separate themselves from white why because the idea okay thank you okay

[02:21:42.970 --> 02:21:46.610]
great there there you go there's the best call we've had on the earth to the end of the year but

[02:21:46.610 --> 02:21:52.950]
there's the best call we've ever had black people are coming up with these names he says here's

[02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:57.670]
a brother who calls in to say to go on the one hand that he he hears a lot of racial undertones

[02:21:57.670 --> 02:22:01.470]
so in other words but if black people hate white people that's not racism is that correct

[02:22:01.470 --> 02:22:08.310]
uh-huh thank you thank you for the education lesson I see it it's like it's like people have that

[02:22:08.310 --> 02:22:13.170]
that pedal this idea that if you speak english correctly if you're a black person in this country

[02:22:13.170 --> 02:22:16.890]
not other countries because black people other countries speak perfect English the way I'm speaking I

[02:22:16.890 --> 02:22:23.270]
be speaking right now they do not ask no questions but if you speak english the way honky you do

[02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:27.690]
then that suddenly makes you honky is okay and that takes away your black identity as if uh

[02:22:27.690 --> 02:22:31.450]
see on a one hand don't pay attention to my skin color this guy is saying and don't be

[02:22:31.450 --> 02:22:35.030]
erases but on the other hand I want to name myself some freaky name or my kids don't freaky

[02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:39.390]
as name because we want to be as far away from the white people as possible which I don't I just

[02:22:39.390 --> 02:22:49.050]
don't get it but I'm glad that now we are learned the lesson huh 1360 1360 oh my god thank you

[02:22:49.050 --> 02:22:54.350]
Sentinel fire protection whoo Sentinel fire protection whoever they are thank you for

[02:22:54.990 --> 02:23:00.650]
us they brought back to check 1360 bucks and it's only 115 the little hand is on the big

[02:23:00.650 --> 02:23:06.830]
head is exactly 115 that bad last call there you could sit and you could analyze that for hours

[02:23:06.830 --> 02:23:10.590]
just thinking about what that guy could last amount a lot longer but I think to chop it right at that

[02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:16.930]
point was the exact appropriate spot to chop it so we can just kind of digest and swallow and the

[02:23:16.930 --> 02:23:24.250]
spit out and uh out of our system everything that he just said I thought we were like all

[02:23:24.250 --> 02:23:29.370]
trying to didn't wasn't uh what's his name that said can't we all just get long huh Rodney King

[02:23:29.370 --> 02:23:34.110]
didn't he be saying that to the camera he's getting there's a normal name yeah Rodney King Rod

[02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:42.110]
what's wrong with the rod if it was good enough for hot rod humley here's Miami hello

[02:23:42.490 --> 02:23:47.150]
hey man what the hell are you doing I've been doing fine I'm right hey I don't I know you brought

[02:23:47.150 --> 02:23:51.310]
up uh you didn't want to bring up the sports intensive but why is it that in this town they talk

[02:23:51.310 --> 02:23:56.210]
about the game coming up a week before after they lose the game they still keep calling up asking

[02:23:56.210 --> 02:24:00.490]
what we could have done more than I agree with you Jimmy John well let me ask you this what

[02:24:00.490 --> 02:24:04.210]
else are they going to talk about you know when you come right down to it it's in no listen to me

[02:24:04.210 --> 02:24:09.430]
it's like talking about sawdust okay huh no seriously how many different things could we if you

[02:24:09.430 --> 02:24:14.610]
want I wanted to have a conversation about sawdust how long could that conversation last and it's

[02:24:14.610 --> 02:24:18.730]
the same thing on a sports station the whole concept believe me I want us to make billions of dollars

[02:24:18.730 --> 02:24:23.150]
here everybody to do well but the concept of a sports station especially in the non sports time

[02:24:23.150 --> 02:24:27.410]
like this to begin with is ludicrous I mean there's such a limited number of things they can talk

[02:24:27.410 --> 02:24:31.770]
about which is why it's so ponderous and repetitive and you keep hearing people say the same thing

[02:24:31.770 --> 02:24:36.470]
over and over and over and even if these people know what they were talking about which they don't

[02:24:36.470 --> 02:24:40.530]
it still would be ponderous because there's only so many ways to describe sawdust and the best

[02:24:40.530 --> 02:24:46.190]
part is when these analist analize things they all say if you listen to them the defense has got

[02:24:46.190 --> 02:24:51.370]
stopped the scoring the offense has got to score a lot and the special team I'm coming home I'm

[02:24:51.370 --> 02:24:56.570]
coming home from the track last night and some some young guy not a kid but some young guy calls in

[02:24:56.570 --> 02:25:02.990]
and ask Ed Kaplan with a straight face he says Ed you think you think our defense can compete

[02:25:02.990 --> 02:25:07.750]
with Denver in that game next week now even somebody who pays his little attention as I do

[02:25:07.750 --> 02:25:11.750]
knows the dolphins probably have the best defense on the whole league okay what kind of a question

[02:25:12.290 --> 02:25:17.330]
the dolphins problem is their defense it's a lack of offense it's no offense okay and here's the

[02:25:17.330 --> 02:25:20.970]
guy with a straight like the guy the kid that called the Ed at the beginning of the baseball season

[02:25:20.970 --> 02:25:26.170]

[02:27:18.410 --> 02:27:22.670]
sixty on the 18t wireless line do we denote some racists undertones to all of this uh

[02:27:23.310 --> 02:27:27.410]
only racists undertones I noticed were the ones that that guy was talking about about how we

[02:27:27.410 --> 02:27:31.770]
Heat the white people like poison and we don't want your names. Okay. Well guess what you can't have our names

[02:27:31.770 --> 02:27:36.310]
How do you like that? What have our names are like Al any black eyes named Al? No

[02:27:37.650 --> 02:27:40.090]
There's always Malcolm on the young in the horny. What's wrong with Malcolm?

[02:27:41.750 --> 02:27:43.450]
Nothing that I can see with the naked eye

[02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:47.910]
But seriously, I mean there's a name. I'm Malcolm. Everybody likes Malcolm

[02:27:47.910 --> 02:27:52.610]
He's not too dark not too light. He's just like kind of like a light mocha right in between just right

[02:27:53.150 --> 02:27:55.430]
Okay, where we go on here's a Davy hello

[02:27:56.190 --> 02:28:00.730]
Hello Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, I like to say I do to take some races on their tone

[02:28:00.730 --> 02:28:03.850]
Yeah, but that guy they called earlier about the black sitting white

[02:28:04.290 --> 02:28:06.970]
Worse than anything else said. Yeah, but a lot of it

[02:28:06.970 --> 02:28:12.810]
So that's the point I'm trying to make you is that that when people do things that are a little bit of creates a stereotype

[02:28:12.810 --> 02:28:17.870]
And you think my god if there are people are too stupid even be able to name their kids with a like a real name

[02:28:18.250 --> 02:28:23.430]
Like a lemon jello and orange jello. You know, what do we talk? What do we to be talking about here?

[02:28:23.430 --> 02:28:25.950]
Well, it's one thing with you know Americans naming

[02:28:27.130 --> 02:28:34.090]
Remain Rhea's on your name's a name, but it's also thing like you know the time guy named Gia Setti a June angel odd an Arabic name

[02:28:34.090 --> 02:28:34.590]
Mahmoud

[02:28:34.590 --> 02:28:39.910]
I'm okay, right. Yeah, no problem with people in that they come to this country. I don't know other than one guy

[02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:43.910]
I don't know any other Makhmouds though. That's the only Makhmoud I know is the football player

[02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:45.830]
Well, we go in the Middle East there's a lot of

[02:28:46.410 --> 02:28:47.910]
Mahmoud Aburo, Ostea, Basko

[02:28:47.910 --> 02:28:50.350]
I mean the best people whatever hell you get a woof yeah

[02:28:50.350 --> 02:28:56.290]
Nothing is um as far as you know god sham god. I really don't care. I'm a dear so we can name itself whatever you want

[02:28:56.290 --> 02:28:57.610]
Well, what kind of a name is that though?

[02:28:58.030 --> 02:29:04.450]
He has a big ego but I'm name so god and X ray hate that idea, but you know I said it is just ridiculous

[02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:08.110]
But um, how about his brother X ray? How about him?

[02:29:08.910 --> 02:29:11.690]
But another thing is on the ebonyx issue. Yes, sir

[02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:17.730]
I hear a lot of the white especially southern white making fun of black with ebonyx

[02:29:17.730 --> 02:29:22.430]
Most other the pot comical black. Yeah, most white southern ebonyx really just a southern

[02:29:22.950 --> 02:29:26.450]
dialect not really a black dialect or a white dialect the southern dialect

[02:29:26.450 --> 02:29:29.450]
Yeah, and there's no real such thing as speaking white just speaking proper

[02:29:29.970 --> 02:29:34.810]
There's you know proper speech and yeah, but we would see what it makes fun of southern white but they are not listening

[02:29:34.810 --> 02:29:37.870]
They're all busy on the jury spring or show so we don't have the point you know

[02:29:38.270 --> 02:29:41.310]
All right, and um also I'd like to say one thing I went out into

[02:29:42.130 --> 02:29:43.630]
Public so it was a girl named unique

[02:29:44.190 --> 02:29:50.410]
And I can't remember the spelling because it was like something like you and I Q you probably EU and I see a

[02:29:50.410 --> 02:29:55.690]
Have a great day, Pat. I'm really there too. What do you say? Okay, we have an open line in brown at five six seven oh five sixty

[02:29:55.690 --> 02:30:02.490]
I guess that's what it's all about diversity do your thing make up some stupid name and there you go and we can also it back in life at you

[02:30:03.350 --> 02:30:04.250]
I want to change mine

[02:30:05.690 --> 02:30:09.550]
Yeah, how about changing the spelling okay? How about getting with the program mr

[02:30:09.550 --> 02:30:13.030]
I was living Cuba for five minutes written on my birth certificate what

[02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:15.550]
That's how it was written you know something

[02:30:15.550 --> 02:30:18.310]
I don't think that most people as you go through life will say oh by the way

[02:30:18.310 --> 02:30:23.430]
Can I check your birth certificate to make sure that that's the way your name was spelled spelled on there that's spelling better next word

[02:30:23.430 --> 02:30:27.290]
I don't like that name or spelling better with a J okay, we're gonna change it it doesn't matter

[02:30:29.430 --> 02:30:29.790]
Jorge

[02:30:31.510 --> 02:30:35.450]
That that's how it's really pronounced by it's not Jorge by the way for those that you go him out there

[02:30:35.450 --> 02:30:36.370]
It's Jorge

[02:30:37.150 --> 02:30:41.830]
It's how it's pronounced in Espanol which is a disgusting guttable sounding grotesque

[02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:45.810]
But it's kind of like fits in there with a foreskin. Okay, here's a sunrise hello

[02:30:46.270 --> 02:30:47.430]
No, how you doing great?

[02:30:47.650 --> 02:30:51.570]
Um, I think the names that these people come up with are related to their diet

[02:30:52.430 --> 02:30:57.390]
Because if you eat enough barbecued yeah drinking up malt liquor. Yeah, eat enough water. I'm not

[02:30:57.390 --> 02:31:00.310]
I'm tired chicken. Yes, you're sitting on the pot and it sounds like

[02:31:01.250 --> 02:31:02.690]
I need a

[02:31:05.230 --> 02:31:06.970]
Okay, what do you say something about?

[02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:09.070]
Oh

[02:31:09.070 --> 02:31:10.570]
Too much bad pot is what I think he's

[02:31:10.570 --> 02:31:16.410]
Okay, we have an open line in brown or five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[02:31:16.410 --> 02:31:22.110]
Oh, you're not that there any stereotypes in here. I'd mention there are probably plenty of black folks in this town

[02:31:22.110 --> 02:31:23.630]
Don't eat no watermelon or fried chicken

[02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:27.370]
One by the way when you go to the animal coast you love the fact that they do have both

[02:31:27.370 --> 02:31:32.850]
All kinds of chicken including fried chicken and watermelon. How do you like that? No seriously? They do

[02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:38.210]
You don't have to be black to like watermelon. I do like watermelon. It's matter of fact. I love watermelon

[02:31:38.870 --> 02:31:40.790]
Except it's all you know spitting out the seed

[02:31:40.790 --> 02:31:41.490]
hmm

[02:31:42.290 --> 02:31:45.950]
Not it's just a waste of time spitting out the seed though when you got a lot of practice spitting out

[02:31:49.610 --> 02:31:53.190]
Get the piece of cake here's a mobile in a little Havana. Hello

[02:31:53.810 --> 02:31:56.030]
Yeah, I always spit personally, but you know I believe

[02:31:56.670 --> 02:32:00.590]
Listen to you. I tell you buddy just get a day on TV. I'll go sing on at the

[02:32:00.590 --> 02:32:04.450]
Another another re-run another one of those crappy re-runs about his fantasies about

[02:32:04.450 --> 02:32:11.490]
You know him and me out god. I wouldn't I wouldn't touch him with a 10 foot ugly stick. I think somebody beat me to it

[02:32:11.490 --> 02:32:15.690]
I think what you're doing the weirdest black person I've ever heard is Oprah

[02:32:16.710 --> 02:32:18.710]
Yeah, we've just spelled Harpo backwards

[02:32:19.350 --> 02:32:23.410]
And have a great day. Yeah, like we're supposed to be Harpo, but I want to just story with her

[02:32:23.410 --> 02:32:29.730]
I don't want to be like we're not attacking black people. They all I did all I mentioned way back early in the show today was something about the Keeshawn

[02:32:30.190 --> 02:32:32.570]
And the fact that that name just irritates the living

[02:32:33.090 --> 02:32:34.050]
Day life out of me

[02:32:35.170 --> 02:32:37.930]
I don't know what it is. There's a lot of names that are freer than that

[02:32:37.930 --> 02:32:43.470]
But there's something about that one particular name that just drives the right out of my brains or right into my brains

[02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:48.730]
Keeshawn. Hey Keeshawn. They're it's just it's just a bad name. It'd be a bad name

[02:32:49.590 --> 02:32:51.470]
Yes 1400 and there's nobody there

[02:32:53.790 --> 02:32:55.910]
You know if you don't stop complaining so much Chris

[02:32:57.530 --> 02:33:01.610]
1400 bucks and didn't I just give the address again and there's nobody there we raised 14

[02:33:01.610 --> 02:33:05.090]
I we got 35 minutes to a go we could probably get close to 2 grand there today

[02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:10.630]
If we get your ass and gear up there in Coral Springs and stop playing hard to get all you folks with the big bucks

[02:33:11.690 --> 02:33:17.510]
Chevron station corner these southeast corner of university in rural Palm the big QAM van is there look for Chris and Lou

[02:33:18.350 --> 02:33:21.930]
And we got to often t-shirts. We got stuff to give you you give us your money

[02:33:21.930 --> 02:33:26.170]
We got the best of the LCDs and cassettes and t-shirts and good time will be head by all I

[02:33:28.310 --> 02:33:32.050]
Think we're doing swimmingly well as that's by far and away the best endeavor the whole

[02:33:32.570 --> 02:33:35.410]
Things so far and he's still bitching up there

[02:33:36.270 --> 02:33:39.890]
126 at 560 wqm you know god

[02:33:47.230 --> 02:33:47.910]

[02:33:47.910 --> 02:33:48.270]
Starting from

[02:33:48.270 --> 02:33:52.610]
You get a loop the voice

[02:33:52.610 --> 02:33:54.950]
It's just a little tight okay

[02:33:54.950 --> 02:34:02.090]
And then you swale around and twale around from left to right

[02:34:02.690 --> 02:34:05.210]
For her in position for the whole earth

[02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:14.250]
And

[02:34:14.250 --> 02:34:16.650]
And that's what I call falling up

[02:34:16.650 --> 02:34:20.810]
You run

[02:34:28.190 --> 02:34:32.010]
And then you spoil around and spoil around from left to right

[02:34:39.470 --> 02:34:40.010]
Oh

[02:34:40.010 --> 02:34:42.210]
Now he's ready to call time

[02:34:42.210 --> 02:34:47.430]
But that's what I call falling up broad

[02:34:48.010 --> 02:34:51.070]
Instead of then your head when you gotta get off

[02:34:51.970 --> 02:34:57.830]

[02:37:31.990 --> 02:37:42.310]
Little baby love ors. Yeah, okay. Thank you for whatever you just said. I think we have an open line and Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:37:43.330 --> 02:37:46.070]
15 60 see there you go 15 60

[02:37:47.290 --> 02:37:51.590]
That's a nice number 15 60. I think it was to work at some stage that was 15 60 on a radio dial

[02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:54.650]
Maybe it was WTPS and Kalamazoo was that 15 60?

[02:37:54.830 --> 02:37:59.130]
A hundred years ago, which is now WBUK country K. I think if it's still on the year

[02:37:59.750 --> 02:38:03.950]
Those were the days baby in Kalamazoo Michigan. What a great town that is and was

[02:38:04.730 --> 02:38:09.010]
Until I took that chickie's pizza off wasn't a javitor. What a great what a damn we love shakies

[02:38:09.530 --> 02:38:12.350]
And that's the great thing when you run under rock station like we were up there

[02:38:12.350 --> 02:38:16.610]
All you got to do they call up and hey, can we hear the stones that whatever you want just send some pizzas over

[02:38:16.610 --> 02:38:18.910]
And they would say okay, and they did

[02:38:19.530 --> 02:38:24.250]
Used to like shakies pizza whatever happened and then besides about other business just like whatever happened to godfathers

[02:38:26.650 --> 02:38:31.590]
Huh see that now that speaks volumes on the back because I think they're still in business the they're from

[02:38:32.810 --> 02:38:37.010]
Omaha is the home headquarters of godfathers and they tried it down here

[02:38:37.010 --> 02:38:41.510]
And I used to rave in fact there was a friend co-ed of mine a friend. I wish he was a friend. Havier

[02:38:42.970 --> 02:38:46.490]
On Sunset down in Kendall remember you remember the godfathers down there

[02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:50.430]
Not down there on Sunset out by where I live near a hundred and seven times

[02:38:51.490 --> 02:38:55.870]
And Havier when I worked at WNW West of all places which was an old foggy station

[02:38:55.870 --> 02:39:00.750]
But nevertheless I remember he came to the station one day Havier come back Havier always probably old and ugly now

[02:39:00.750 --> 02:39:04.290]
But at any rate that was a great great place

[02:39:05.690 --> 02:39:09.970]
That was a great chain godfathers like each pizza weighed about like 30 pounds

[02:39:11.230 --> 02:39:12.590]
And they had like the the

[02:39:13.130 --> 02:39:15.330]
Mexican or the taco pizza whatever

[02:39:15.330 --> 02:39:19.210]
I think they were the first ones that really came up with all the real funky different kinds of thick

[02:39:19.210 --> 02:39:26.950]
pizzas that were like like a real pie that's just like a thin like a you know, I hear pie, but like a thick like a real pie

[02:39:27.490 --> 02:39:29.170]
With the cheese on top. Mmm

[02:39:30.090 --> 02:39:33.490]
Yeah extra cheese you know about that. Here's Miami. Hello

[02:39:33.950 --> 02:39:34.330]
Hello

[02:39:36.390 --> 02:39:37.670]
Yes, I'm out of shot

[02:39:38.570 --> 02:39:43.770]
Now what was his name originally? I don't even know no no seriously his original name was like um

[02:39:44.450 --> 02:39:51.330]
Oh somebody will call on it. I'm sure Joe Costello knows and and uh a couple of years ago the guy in the NBA named tree

[02:39:51.710 --> 02:39:58.370]
Rollins. Yeah, remember him. Oh, yeah, he's a kind of tree cropper now. He's a real black guy right a big black guy named tree

[02:39:59.050 --> 02:40:02.930]
When I was in school fact, there used to be two in the family, but once he was born there was tree

[02:40:03.890 --> 02:40:08.190]
When I was in school though, I knew this girl are complex it. Her first name was Bay

[02:40:08.690 --> 02:40:16.790]
Her middle name was King and you know like Susan powder. That was the last name soda. It was baking powder. Oh my god

[02:40:17.490 --> 02:40:18.250]
All right

[02:40:18.250 --> 02:40:26.270]
Have a day pal a lot of sick people out there. Yes, was it Bobby Moore? No, okay. I don't I don't think so a modern shot

[02:40:26.270 --> 02:40:28.770]
That was the same Bobby Moore his name was uh

[02:40:29.410 --> 02:40:30.150]
Come on

[02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:36.710]
All these guys all these hot shots that changed their name like Lou Alcindor became Karim Abdul Jabbar

[02:40:36.710 --> 02:40:43.190]
Which Howard Costello would never been as big if he didn't have Karim Abdul Jabbar and Muhammad Ali to Haka, China kabar

[02:40:44.270 --> 02:40:46.550]
I mean other than the fact that he was arrogant and egotistical

[02:40:46.550 --> 02:40:50.350]
What that was wrong with Howard Costello who you know was the first one to talk about the jack aqua

[02:40:50.350 --> 02:40:54.150]
See in the term. No, he stole that from somebody else the term, but he talked about it. He unmatched it

[02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:55.970]
He told us that Frank Yiford was a douchebag

[02:40:58.030 --> 02:40:58.430]
And

[02:40:58.430 --> 02:41:02.670]
He was way ahead of his time and seeing exactly what was coming down the pike and here you got it today

[02:41:02.670 --> 02:41:06.450]
Maybe they've destroyed it. They've taken the fun out of it. They've killed it

[02:41:07.470 --> 02:41:13.030]
It was Bobby Moore Bobby Moore like I said, I think it was Bobby Moore. Here's Miami Beach. Hello. Hello, sir

[02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:16.690]
Yes, sir. Hey, you got a line jam with this name. They're smoking it. Yeah

[02:41:16.690 --> 02:41:24.010]
Yeah, by the way first of all happy Chuka. Yeah, I'm on in fact to you and I got five names for you. Okay, five

[02:41:24.010 --> 02:41:30.710]
Okay, yeah, the first one I tried to work in a bank. She was Lakita L-A-K-I-T-A. Lakita

[02:41:31.530 --> 02:41:35.950]
Then we have not two sets of brother names the first set is their Turkish

[02:41:36.490 --> 02:41:43.190]
Urson and Ergen person with ERS UN and their last name is Yulush or Urson Yuluk

[02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:45.870]
Something like that person and Ergen that sounds Swedish

[02:41:46.850 --> 02:41:52.010]
You're done Ergen person and Ergen yet sounds like an old seed probably anti-Semitic too

[02:41:52.650 --> 02:41:56.870]
As the other one no they were cool as the other one was now. I don't know

[02:41:57.450 --> 02:41:58.990]
I know one of them was om god

[02:41:59.590 --> 02:42:04.490]
Like what did he go around talking about? Hey, I'm God and then his brother. I don't remember it was something god

[02:42:04.490 --> 02:42:11.250]
By God, it was good. Yeah, yeah, it was something Neil God. Bye God. Oh, God. Uh-huh. That's all I got sir

[02:42:11.250 --> 02:42:14.570]
Okay, thank you so much sir and God bless you and have a happy whatever you're celebrating okay

[02:42:15.270 --> 02:42:21.470]
And don't too much over the holidays. We have an open line of day. This is really we we touch the raw nerve here today

[02:42:21.470 --> 02:42:24.430]
Do I sense do I detect a little bit of racism in the middle of us?

[02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:26.310]
Why detect it? Oh too bad

[02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:30.750]
No, it's not racism. It's just that we'd be saying that this in fact

[02:42:30.750 --> 02:42:34.530]
I think that made the point I mean tickled at that I brought this up again for the 200th time

[02:42:35.530 --> 02:42:38.450]
And this is the only with the only time we've ever had a response like this on it

[02:42:38.450 --> 02:42:42.250]
I brought it up many times in the past and maybe they were too embarrassed to talk about this

[02:42:42.970 --> 02:42:45.410]
But it is it's like driving a wedge

[02:42:45.410 --> 02:42:50.030]
It's like driving a big fat thick wedge right down the middle between

[02:42:50.550 --> 02:42:54.110]
People who will like have real names and people who don't whether they're white black or whatever

[02:42:54.590 --> 02:42:58.210]
To want to make up some wild crazy stupid names then go ahead

[02:42:58.210 --> 02:43:03.050]
But the rest of us will laugh at you and take you an asshole and probably in some cases be right 1640

[02:43:03.730 --> 02:43:07.810]
It's wrong with that. It's zooming up there like I said we got 20 minutes to get close to 2 grand

[02:43:07.810 --> 02:43:12.110]
And we got 1640 there at the Chevron station on the southeast corner of

[02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:13.650]
University of World Palm

[02:43:14.170 --> 02:43:15.230]
in Coles Springs

[02:43:16.490 --> 02:43:20.890]
1640 never in our wildest dreams that we ever anticipate no that we could do this

[02:43:20.890 --> 02:43:23.130]
So we can get close to another 2 grand today up there

[02:43:23.130 --> 02:43:27.490]
Are we going to hear from Carol? Do you think it's said a one today? No, I think the fact that she is in the front

[02:43:27.490 --> 02:43:29.830]
Even though it seems to be working on this end

[02:43:30.390 --> 02:43:36.290]
I'm at a loss. What do you mean by that? I mean it's but it's not receiving maybe it's only sending it's not receiving the right thing

[02:43:36.290 --> 02:43:37.810]
It's not sending it's very bad

[02:43:38.210 --> 02:43:43.110]
Well, I'm sure she could probably call you too you know what I'm saying 20 to 2 at 5 50 WQM

[02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:45.190]
This is a bunch of hooi

[02:44:11.970 --> 02:44:13.090]
All right

[02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:19.250]
But my heritage say is that's okay change my name to shoot through

[02:44:19.250 --> 02:44:21.990]
Drive a doomsend Dakota any Cadillac

[02:44:25.390 --> 02:44:31.270]
I remember when I was feeling all the white men's cars hanging outside

[02:44:31.270 --> 02:44:32.630]

They would pull down good to me. I got plenty of nothing

[02:45:21.010 --> 02:45:23.830]
You're buying a thing getting me anywhere

[02:45:23.830 --> 02:45:26.410]
Maybe I'll mug an old white bitch

[02:45:26.410 --> 02:45:31.310]
Feel the push and pull her hand then I gonna take some money

[02:45:32.190 --> 02:45:34.550]

[02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:43.570]

[02:45:43.570 --> 02:45:44.890]

147 to 560 WQM

[02:46:20.130 --> 02:46:23.130]
I can't believe this a crawl springs thing with a center one totals

[02:46:23.130 --> 02:46:25.050]
How's housey and do by the way anybody seen her

[02:46:25.050 --> 02:46:25.530]
No

[02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:31.210]
1660 bucks with 13 minutes ago we could do two grand the crawl springs today

[02:46:31.210 --> 02:46:37.570]
That would be a freaking miracle baby even more exciting than the Virgin Mary apparent on the side of the first national bank building in peoria

[02:46:39.230 --> 02:46:43.950]
What does that say on there? Oh the Mickey work lady. I think that is all probably is let's get rid of her right away

[02:46:43.950 --> 02:46:45.130]
Hello, is this the Mickey work lady

[02:46:45.990 --> 02:46:47.290]
Officer credit is huh

[02:46:47.930 --> 02:46:54.190]

If you're in the area there is by the Ashabran station University of rural palm

[02:47:24.250 --> 02:47:26.230]
Undergar southeast corner there in Coral Springs

[02:47:26.970 --> 02:47:29.330]
240 bucks more and we'll make two thousand today

[02:47:29.330 --> 02:47:33.130]
That should make the headlines on a front page of all those papers tomorrow, right? No come on

[02:47:34.250 --> 02:47:36.230]
Coral Springs puts itself on a map

[02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:42.070]
Coral Springs is more than just gangs and more than just a bunch of snooty people and more than just a bunch of

[02:47:42.070 --> 02:47:47.270]
Nazis at teravella high school try to whip all those little kids in the shape and make them will be the little goose steppers

[02:47:48.250 --> 02:47:51.190]
Coral Springs is more than that and someday we'll figure out what it is

[02:47:52.110 --> 02:47:57.510]
Here's a mobile in poppano. Hello. Hey Neil good afternoon. Yes, sir. Happy holiday and back to you

[02:47:57.510 --> 02:48:01.870]
And treat things godfather's pizza man was like one of the best wasn't that great

[02:48:01.870 --> 02:48:03.450]
Yeah, you know, there was one on

[02:48:04.170 --> 02:48:09.410]
441 just north of tastery. I think the salvo is in there now right that's right. Yeah. That was a great man

[02:48:09.410 --> 02:48:15.690]
You know something that was the day that godfather's left this town when they packed up in all the franchises closed

[02:48:15.690 --> 02:48:19.810]
I don't know why that was the last gas we had in this place when god

[02:48:19.810 --> 02:48:26.510]
I mean, you know the famous closed and puppet exalco but when godfather's moved out that's today that we knew we lost it

[02:48:26.510 --> 02:48:29.130]
I don't know why because I eat there. I used to eat there a lot, you know, I mean

[02:48:29.130 --> 02:48:34.110]
It was all I wanted to know was always packed. They used to do a land office business. I don't know what I was like

[02:48:34.110 --> 02:48:35.990]
