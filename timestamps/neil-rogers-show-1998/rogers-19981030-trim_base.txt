[00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.480]
Open line and grow it all this is a tremendous response after what I just read there this is just

[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.980]
Sint-Lady

[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.380]
Two bozos back to back

[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.660]
560560

[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.740]
It was a mobile in Miami. The violent crunchy was I accused of a violent crime blow it out to you ads

[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.680]
Oh, this is unbelievable. This is exactly the men counting were dealing with it

[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.640]
Like I said, it's not these guys fault

[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.540]
It's the fan because Del supported they don't give a crap what these guys do as long as we win as long as they run fast

[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.500]
And jump high just like Brian blades, baby. He don't have time to talk to you guys

[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.380]
He's got a glove and a Seattle in play that's what the Rosin house said

[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.780]
Give me a frickin break, okay

[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.100]
Go talk to Pee Wee Herman and blow it out your ass

[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.640]
Here's a lady mobile in Del Rey Beach. Hello. I feel like doing okay, man. Hey, you know what you are completely right

[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.860]
Yeah, three more on back to back to back. Yeah

[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.460]
So don't you understand cuz I'm not in the hero

[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.520]
Don't you want to sense what I'm in to we don't want to hear about all the criminals on there

[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.580]
There's a lot of the college football teams. I know you're this for all these other dumb gots

[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.140]
I agree I'm I'm a I've been turned on to you for six months

[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.060]
And I've been transferred on my girlfriends and everything else on to you

[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.120]
What's 100% of what you say and even with the old day situation?

[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.960]
Okay, we go to kill and get off what do we do? We're still waiting and look at that boys

[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.840]
And then he was evading a red

[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.480]
We had all these assholes running around there with signs on the LA freeway

[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:42.360]
We are talking about a bunch of idiots you got that right here. You got that right and my thing is I think it's time to boycott football

[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.640]
I spoke all widows. We see him sitting there on the TV and I heard me say I'm gonna beer and watch

[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.140]
And I'm going go go go

[00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.540]
They would have been a stressor. What's going on?

[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.140]
I'm not at home. Maybe they won't watch them anymore. All right and game two. Yeah, I wouldn't send them my

[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.000]
I don't see them. I wouldn't my phone wanted by a jersey from

[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.720]
I think there's a dolphin from my friend. I said I won't see a dolphin jersey on your back son and you know, hey

[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.300]
But that's how my feelings are okay. I have a

[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.400]
Yeah, get on here two open lines of power five six seven open line. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello

[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.380]
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, you're absolutely right. I used to play football and they don't cheer

[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.560]
As long as you can run fast somebody

[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.940]
Love you. Yeah, that's all they care about they don't care about nothing else

[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.080]
You can kill somebody and they'll get you off of it and you know

[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.360]
I'm sure that there's some of these golf fans out there thinking but you know

[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.320]
Shula didn't win anything in a long time

[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.520]
I mean two years ago, but Shula at least was a didn't put up a discraft

[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.760]
But Jimmy Johnson, hey, we're five and two. Summoning care. What Jimmy does that's a

[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.020]
Point for he's got to look good. So he's gonna do whatever he can to make himself look good

[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.640]
Well, thank you

[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.900]
Training at you of em and it's Dallas too. Okay, I'll continue. Okay. Thank God that Michael Irvings

[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.740]
Another one of the many guys that Jimmy can take credit for

[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.440]
We have an open line of date fine. Oh, you can't say these things are made. Yeah, right in London

[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.560]
I said before how come the sports segments on this radio station? How come they're not the ones talking about this book and interviewing these authors

[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.120]
Because the several pages I read there is terminal on his boring as it may have been to some people

[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.220]
Never life that was all about stuff going right here in his house. Oh, it was a release

[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.060]
Editors know to be in a chapter. I read Marina will not be handing off the thoughts and goes on about how Jimmy

[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.880]
Johnson has a number of talented running back to replace him and began fumbling the ball and training camp

[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.980]
John, John to explain the reporters his decision to release for what's that?

[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.720]
What would they do with the troubled athletes most recent verse for the law and

[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.760]
Police and it says the book goes to press police

[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.380]
I still investigate any allegations that he assaulted a woman in Miami-Nightclub in June and here it is

[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.760]
The end of October we heard any more about that. No, I haven't heard the final disposition of that. No, but ever hear any more about that. No

[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.840]
Lauren still it's one of the real scumbags in the history of the human race

[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.460]
Stuck as girlfriend and the goddamn stand up post post office box there in Lincoln, Nebraska

[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.680]
Beath and after beating the crap out of her

[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.480]
But hey, you know with these guys got to have anger management courses. They got to have yet they came out of the ghetto

[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.260]
Yeah, right tell Nicole Brown that too. Okay, that OJ came out of the ghetto and tell Ron Golden and his family while you're at it

[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.060]
Always got excuses for abhorrent unacceptable violence behavior. Don't we?

[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.400]
Here's Miami. Hello

[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.580]
Go to the criminal's and yeah, okay

[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.180]
Here's a mobile in always like those guys who got the favor to her

[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.480]
That's always impressive to me a tin can over the phone mobile in North Lauderdale. Hello. How you doing? Meal? Okay, sir

[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.040]
Listen, I gotta respond to this. It sounds like you're making a big deal out of something that's been going on forever

[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.720]
There's there's what you're talking about right now

[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.100]
It's not nothing making a big deal. What happened? Nothing new to anything you were saying

[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.660]
It's been going on in sports beginning of time. Yeah, and

[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.740]
Some other people shouldn't be talking about it. No, no, no

[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.780]
You're right about bringing it to the public attention

[00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.580]
But I what I think is what's going on here and what's dragging it out so much is that the proliferation of media and the ability for media

[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.840]
It just ceases and blown out on all over the airway and makes such a big flux out of men

[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.500]
Who fly on the way that they're almost controlling what's going on now is that it's become so sensational that the big picture

[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.720]
Is then completely blown away that these are people from underprivileged areas. Oh

[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.840]
How

[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.000]
It's very until that's around you know that

[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.020]
I don't I didn't I tend to that I told George that as soon as I finished reading

[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.900]
Linda the break and I said the response is gonna be from assholes like T. Sir

[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.860]
I'll listen to anybody say almost any opinion but that I will not listen to I don't care what area you come from

[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.740]
That's not an excuse for violent behavior against other people. It's not an excuse for murder

[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.280]
It's not an excuse for assault. It's not an excuse for treating women like Dubh human garbage

[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.840]
It's not an excuse. I'm sick and tired of hearing that whether you're black whether you're white

[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.120]
I'm not interested in the area whether it's body counts whether it's God

[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.120]
They were in spite mother's Mark Fitzpatrick. I don't want to hear about it

[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.840]
Mark Fitzpatrick didn't cover my god damn underprivileged's neighborhood neither did Bobby Cox

[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.980]
Jesus Joseph what a sad sad sad and you know the interesting part is it points out in this book

[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.860]
See now you understand where he was coming from in the beginning well the media is blowing this all up

[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.140]
No, the media automate blowing it up. That's why this book is so goddamn great

[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.780]
Paying millions of dollars to the lowest scumbags on a facetif just like Mike Tyson

[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.300]
There's a classic example see the boxing fans in his country

[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:41.400]
They don't give a crap what Mike's in how I said it how many people he raped how many years he chews off

[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.120]
How aberrant his behavior is they want to pay to see him fight some stumbled on me yet because for whatever reason

[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.280]
Go to them that's exciting

[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.780]
So don't confuse them with the facts

[00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:00.120]
But this horsecraft and in addition to which these are the guys these are the select few guys who've been taken out of the

[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.840]
My out of the ghettos and give any opportunity to make millions of dollars

[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.080]
80% of the players in the NBA are black

[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.120]
What would most of those guys be doing if they were playing basketball and making millions and millions of dollars?

[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.160]
What would they be doing?

[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.320]
So when somebody gives you the opportunity to make millions of dollars and be a big hero and a big celebrity

[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.140]
And then you turn around and continue being a scumbag something's wrong there somewhere right Mark Dupur

[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.940]
I mean you could go down a list you've got a list as long as your arm and your leg put together

[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.300]
And this guy's trying to make it sure I got and I'm in all my life

[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.780]
I've been a liberal but you know something when it comes to this that's why I draw the line

[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.400]
I'm not interested in the labels let it comes to the death penalty triumph

[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.080]
When it comes to scumbags who have no respect for other people

[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.700]
Put them away and throw away the goddamn key

[00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.680]
And I knew that this would be the way I told you that right during the break. I said you wait and see

[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.020]
Oh, they were underprivileged they came from the ghetto. They grew up in these gangs

[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.440]
But you know something they were given a chance to get out

[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.360]
How many chances did they get it's like how many beers does it take to enjoy sporting event here?

[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.960]
How many chances do they have to get before we finally say well, you know

[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.920]
Thank God Lawrence Taylor got off drugs. I'm sorry purgatory

[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.520]
Here's a Hollywood hello

[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.920]
No, yes, sir

[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.680]
For asked about this and I might lose your Georgia comments while we're on Harvard. Yes, okay

[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.040]
Onus understood and served you to call okay. I was just sure it yes

[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:43.520]
It's like a history of this country going back to Thai top where he beat a cripple person in the stand

[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.600]
Oh, they really and can kill the porter supposed ring

[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.880]
He went over a bridge. Oh, right. Yeah, so they've used to protect their sports heroes. Uh-huh

[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.640]
It's you know, I think already well. Where did you read that bus? My cobs?

[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.020]
There is articles

[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:06.100]
I've parents retired to a town in northeast Georgia where he's with right and they still can't stand them because there's a real S.O.B

[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.360]
and

[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.320]
I don't think he cares at this point. You don't send them to the next difference now

[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.560]
But it's just like gone constantly or for fear of like you and I did

[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.360]
I've got stuff

[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.560]
You can jail for a way to keep I mean when you're talking about violent crimes

[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.520]
Whether you're talking about killing people beating the crap out of women and other people and maybe shooting people

[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.440]
I mean, we're we're not talking about their little diddling stuff

[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:33.160]
We're not talking about people smoking a little weed or whatever a little are we're talking about violent crime is what we're talking about in a

[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.840]
Grotesquely violent society and these people are supposed to be role models and they're put up on pedestals

[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.160]
Hey, we worship you. Can we have your autograph great?

[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:45.480]
And it's not the attitude like you grew up in the ghetto there are plenty of people that grew up in the ghetto yet

[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.200]
They're not killing people right and come out and they're also not making millions of dollars a year

[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.080]
So what what see society if we are any brain we shouldn't be asking a where did you grow up?

[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.120]
We just expect you to conform to certain just minimal things

[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.220]
We expect you to conform to and if you can't do that then let's put you in a cage somewhere

[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.000]
And up a great day

[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:11.140]
And they can win some games then he doesn't care what they do really exactly. I say put him all in jail. All right

[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.260]
Now congratulations see there you go

[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:19.720]
There's fun. I mean if everybody who grew up in a ghetto was like the like OJ if everybody was murdering everybody

[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.000]
It's totally out of control and beaten women all over the guy there

[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.740]
And please then we have anarchy

[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.460]
Because you got millions of people who grew up in a guy named Getto

[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.880]
Well, but it's an excuse not for me. It's not

[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.760]
Here's a lady mobile in North Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. Oh my arms sound like you

[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:45.200]
Okay, you're a twin sister. Oh, no, I don't have one of those I've been listening to you since 1987 and today

[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.300]
You finally got me out of the closet. Oh my god. Wow. I totally agree with you

[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:50.480]
I

[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.280]
Think that we set these men up and the kids right away

[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.160]
Them and that's the strong in society and that's all I have to say. Thank you. Thanks

[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.820]
Very simple just like the V&H first is not complicated

[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.580]
You don't teach your kids to admire scumbags. That's all we're not talking about scumbags. I'm talking violence criminals

[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.800]
And I hear all this discussion oh

[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.100]
How come this one can't throw a pancake block and outcome this one got a spin or the other one back to help them out

[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.240]
But don't get used this with the facts because either we got you know a bet on the game

[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.180]
Which I do understand that or you know, we want to feel better about ourselves

[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.160]
It would be like just like my going to that panther game there but I wasn't at this graceful display

[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.080]
Am I gonna come in here the next day and say and start playing that stupid?

[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.060]
Next time we'll be okay

[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.500]
I'm gonna do that. I need to suck the actor tell

[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:53.800]
Guys making millions of dollars go on to the motions putting out a future performance quite frankly boring me to tears

[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.420]
Yeah, I still save you they're killing the geese to lay the big ones baby just like the vaguely baseball on a big

[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.620]
A little bit of a reprieve but it's only a matter of time

[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.280]
Especially with what the mess to be a bit of and the NBA they're shooting themselves right in the goddamn

[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.160]
Big one

[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.900]
And you know something it's amazing

[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:17.140]
But there are no NBA genes going on right now and the world is still going around

[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.660]
And John Glenn is still taking a big up there in outer space and

[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:28.180]
People are still you know changing their underwear every day. We hope of every couple of days every couple weeks and

[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.240]
Life is going on

[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.200]
Evil that a bunch of big freaks Janet of all down in the hoop

[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.420]
Isn't that a miracle?

[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.000]
How do we get out of them tomorrow?

[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.800]
You know because I have so many sleepless nights worried about Andre reading the Bruce Smith and

[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.060]
Emma Thomas

[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.560]
I have nightmares that Jim Kelly might come back

[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.060]
Here's Miami. Hello

[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.940]
Miami hello Neil. Yes, sir. I

[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.660]
Appoint about the

[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.620]
Football

[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.140]
Campbell that you're talking about. Yes, I come from a football family my father

[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.440]
That's first in his family to graduate from university

[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.340]
played for the original

[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.420]
Camping Bulldogs after 1926

[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.920]
It was only by the grace of God and athletic ability that I got a

[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.680]
Fellowship to get to university graduated

[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.360]
I played football. Yeah

[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.080]
Now I'm watching and have been watching over the past few years the

[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.180]
Disintegration if you will of the of the student athlete

[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.940]
Jason point the University of Miami

[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.440]
My opinion about

[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.440]
That Jimmy Johnson

[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.480]
Has seriously contributed to the other reason collecting

[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:55.040]
entirely capable players possibly first rounders future first rounders even

[00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:00.180]
That would not only be a better super school. That would be a credit to their community

[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.940]
It almost appears as if there was some kind of

[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.860]
Effort special effort made to to recruit to from the bottom of the teaching

[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:17.260]
First time I can't understand it. Yeah, it equally good. Yeah, well

[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:21.220]
He never met a bodily didn't like him, but for some reason I go thought drinking with his players

[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.300]
It's just one of those things. It's a good time. There's some reason

[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.940]
I have to connect in my mind

[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:35.420]
Jimmy Johnson and the conscious recruitment. Yeah, but you see you have to understand these things couldn't happen

[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.000]
Without the fans and at university at the college level without the alumni

[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000]
They're the ones who put the pressure to bear for these guys to win and now they do it at all causes making a difference because it's big money

[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.140]
You know no no no no you got the contract with NBC national TV contract

[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:54.400]
We're talking millions and billions at dollars now and so you know as long as these people is these this is their priority

[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.120]
To be part of a winning athletic program. That's the most important thing to them

[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.660]
It's gonna get worse and worse until the bubble just burst and all fall apart

[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.640]
You're absolutely you're absolutely correct. They you know student athlete that they didn't like from somewhere

[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:11.380]
Also around the state who live in Jacksonville or wherever that they could kind of like ship in a little carpet bag in action there

[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.960]
Pretty soon. It's gonna be in the kindergarten

[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.420]
Well, you know, they brought this kid in from he's going to school and powered right now

[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.080]
They brought him in from Orlando, but man this kid is gonna be a great quarterback our theme

[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:28.640]
And like I said, it's the adults. It's the silly idiotic people out there who like think this is the most important

[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.080]
God damn thing in the world

[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.340]
Is it the most important? Oh, no, I don't think so

[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:40.880]
Priorities are all screwed off their upside down people that we ought to be paying a lot all we've got such crappy education

[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.080]
We got no one good teachers

[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.940]
Teachers just suck the big one baby

[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.960]
Well, take a look at all the big bucks your paying the teachers and

[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.000]
Take a look at how much you're paying people in law enforcement and

[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.700]
Paying people are doing jobs where they risk their lives every then talking about good people

[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.280]
Really care about trying to do a job and then take a look at the money that you're paying these assholes

[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260]
91 I'm gonna tell you something people from coast to coast

[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:10.760]
They got to be flooding the phone lines at MSNBC instead of talking about penis gate and some see now old parts

[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.760]
Been in a rounded outer space. They ought to be flooding the phone lines

[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.980]
Saying this is the end of American society as we knew it

[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.860]
We were in a deep spiral and decline and it's got nothing to do with the oral sex

[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:28.560]
It has to do with people losing their whole semblance of reality their whole perspective on my life is really all about and what is important

[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.600]
And what is not important they have lost it?

[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.380]
Oh gee, we don't know how we're gonna keep the franchise we can't pay a

[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:41.880]
91 million a hundred million anybody here 200 million and the best part is they weren't even bidding against anybody

[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:46.720]
There was ten close to what they paid but just to make sure because you know my key didn't like the 84 million loss

[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.200]
Angelo's even though he was crying about missing the dodge or blue and whatever

[00:16:52.520 --> 00:17:00.440]
You're talking crazy people who are destroying you you're watching these people destroying their own empire right before your eyes

[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.460]
They're killing it

[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.680]
It's 158

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.300]
The Neil Roger shot Lauderdale

[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.820]
On all the crack guys moping high school

[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.940]
Never leave my own anything at all

[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:30.600]
Am I a free education sure has served me well

[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.920]
Right

[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.200]
Is there my own

[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:44.740]
On the land where I'm living

[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:54.640]
We don't have to stay no

[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.000]
Love is more than my face

[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.380]
From Elvis or my jeez in all black velvet

[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:08.920]
Than a back door is my mobile home away

[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.640]
All right

[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:18.580]
Art is where everybody helps out

[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.520]
I'm old

[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.140]
I'm a day

[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.320]
Yeah

[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.120]
They're new

[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.240]
Hey, I'm doing everything

[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.540]
All men have been watching the place

[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.040]
I'm the soul my mobile home away

[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.400]
I'm gonna go right by

[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.140]
I'm gonna take it all the trash

[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.040]
Me and my kids know double why

[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.540]
My only soul my mobile home away

[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:52.940]
All right

[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.520]
My only good reason last one

[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.760]
My only good reason

[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.500]
Put down the gun

[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.820]
My only good by mobile home away

[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.020]
My only soul my mobile home

[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.200]
My only soul my mobile home

[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.340]
My only soul my mobile home away

[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.660]
My only soul my mobile home

[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.840]
My only soul my mobile home away

[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.840]
All right

[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.660]
All right

[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.100]
Colville 3.560

[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.960]
Are you done yet or what?

[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:27.400]
Are you done?

[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.720]
No, you are not

[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.340]
Colville 3.560 W2 on the Hinkover Show at 2

[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.160]
We got Jim Mandage coming out the mad dogs

[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.480]
And I got 6.30 o'clock

[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.200]
And then we got the Panthers in Chicago against the Black Cards

[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.580]
That could be real ugly

[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.840]
Speaking of the Maddoors by the way

[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.260]
They are trained tonight against some horseball team at the Amami Arena

[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.300]
And if you bring the kids under 12 for Halloween

[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.080]
They get in for free

[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:47.800]
I read in the newspaper

[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.600]
You even know they send us nothing about that

[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.860]
We have an open line in the day

[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.980]
It's not only take a couple of minutes

[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.540]
I have too much reading on the show too bad

[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.760]
It's very very fascinating

[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.480]
It's good stuff

[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.800]
Somebody faxes me this article by David Horowitz

[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.520]
From Salon Magazine off the internet

[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.560]
Like the other things

[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.860]
Show your coach to become a cause

[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.260]
But the real trials

[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.680]
I always want to say Latrine

[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.160]
But the reals free well affair

[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.520]
Which proves that whites can tell Black Cards in part nowadays

[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.920]
May mark the end of an era

[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.280]
Try this exercise

[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.240]
Imagine that a white player in the National Basketball Association

[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.340]
At first try to strangle his Black coach

[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.500]
And then threaten to kill him in front of a whole team

[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:26.380]
Suppose that this white player had previously threatened the teammate with a gun on a 2x4

[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.640]
Suppose the NBA, responding to this unprofessional even criminal conduct

[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.560]
Had suspended the white player for a year

[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.560]
And that his team had terminated this contract

[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.460]
How many public figures do you think would step forward to defend the culprits?

[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.140]
How many mirrors of major cities would speak out in his behalf?

[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.740]
As San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown didn't leave a trial-spy well case

[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.640]
Even suggesting that maybe the coach deserved to be chosen

[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.200]
All right

[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.780]
How many famous white lawyers would join his team?

[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.300]
And Claymeis Johnny Cochrane did that there had been a rush to judgment

[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.420]
And a disparity in treatment in applying that the white player was being punished

[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.120]
Only because his victim was Black

[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.100]
Here's another exercise

[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:09.120]
Imagine that a white football star with a history of brutality and jealous rages toward his Black wife

[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.780]
It's expected in a savage murderer who and her friends

[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.900]
Suppose he attempts to flee with the passport and money in his possession toward the Mexican border

[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:23.300]
Suppose his blood is found all over the crime scene and the blood of his dead wife on his clothing is car and at his home

[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:29.400]
Suppose that a 911 recording of an earlier incident with his screen that he was going to kill her is played in court of the whole country

[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.960]
What of a chance is that a white jury would have put him in the rest of an hour?

[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.720]
Or that's a white population which here's such a verdict rather than hang it head in shame

[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.620]
Imagine that a convicted fellowman for all violence and the king had been white

[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:47.640]
He takes the law on a high-speed chase throwing cops off his back when he's finally stopped

[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.480]
And otherwise physically resisting arrest

[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.280]
How much attention would have been paid to the fact that the police got overly tough with him

[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.980]
Would the president of the United States have called for the cops to be tried and tried again until it were sent to jail?

[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:07.320]
Would a white Rodney King have been given three million dollars in compensation by a contrite Los Angeles and made a post-deboy for police brutality and racial injustice by the nation as a whole?

[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.040]
These exercises show what is missing from the current dialogue on race

[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:18.600]
A candid discussion first of the way white America has been overreacting to the shame of its receiving racial peace

[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:26.360]
And then of the way races become such an all-purpose excuse for a much of black America that many prominent black figures don't seem to be able to leave home without it

[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:33.300]
Our blacks failing to keep up educationally with Asians and whites institutional racism must be to blame

[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.520]
Our blacks committing crimes out of all proportion the representation of the population

[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.400]
The racist criminal justice system is responsible

[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:47.240]
Our few high-paid black thugs threatening to bring down the sport that players like Michael Jordan had elevated to such a magnificent level

[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:53.500]
That's just talked by racist white owners and officials rushing to judgment with this spirit punishment level against blacks

[00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:01.460]
Such canter is missing because the so-called dialogue has been framed by people for whom there is only one acceptable conclusion

[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.940]
Blacks are victims, whites are to blame

[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:11.440]
That is why the chairman of the president's commission on race excluded ward Connerley, a pre-manned and a critic of affirmative action from the discussion

[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.660]
Even though it also happens to be black by the way

[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:21.280]
That's even my president Clinton himself would work no disagreement that affirmative action was a good thing during his town hall meeting on race in Aquino Highell

[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:28.360]
Few of their to suggest that affirmative action has become racial payback to oppose it as to blame the victim which of course no decent person would do

[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:35.580]
Those directing the dialogue can't accept that America has moved far beyond the bad days of segregation and institutional racial injustice

[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:41.920]
This is the 90s with black multi-millionaires like Spreewald constituting 80% of the NBA players

[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:50.060]
Black millionaires like Brown calling the shots in major cities and black millionaires like Johnny Conferring demanding national audiences in magazine covers

[00:23:50.640 --> 00:24:03.380]
And the rest of America knows it the overwhelmingly negative reactor the Spreewald affair and the ludicrous comments by people like Mayor Brown suggest that the rest of America including liberal sports writers and commentators may at least be ready to say it out loud

[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:11.300]
They've had it up to the ears with the blame games and the self-lagilation in no small part because they realized such attitudes only made things worse

[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:17.300]
The Spreewald affair shows they were approaching the end of an era which is the best news about race yet

[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:28.840]
White America has changed all blacks no longer look alike even ordinary American sports fans for instance no longer look at all blacks as on the anonymous other the inscrutable menace or the universal victim

[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:38.180]
White American can tell the difference between a liberal spree well and a Michael Jordan between a Chris Darden and a Johnny Coquing and award Connolly or Willie Brown there's a lot of hope in that

[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.540]
So David Horowitz and Salon magazine let's share for David Horowitz there you go baby

[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:43.080]
Oh

[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.540]
Well a lot of reading today. Thank God lunches here from Tony's

[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:54.860]
Thank you our friendship Tony's out. I'm a little disappointed and Hank is great. I love Hank. I do listen around the way home

[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.400]
But yesterday I heard that thing with our friend over there at Scott

[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.380]
Scott permanent land city sub

[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.680]
I mean after you've been doing it this long when you're big and fat like I am and like Hank is and you love your food

[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.220]
You've got to be able to get your food completely without having an argument

[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:15.840]
I'm giving people out of that out of shape. There's nobody I don't care what the ratings say. I don't care what the audience tells you I don't care about anything else

[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:22.020]
Nobody in the universe knows more about getting free food in here than we do on this show. Oh nice Tony sub

[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.960]
Got some soup got some what we got me fall sausage

[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:33.620]
9 minutes after noon and five for Tony's pizza and the subs Tony's pizza, which is located where?

[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.700]
Come on, let's give him a little plug here for Christ say so you're losing it

[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:45.680]
193 and 441 I'm relieved to read in 441 right down the street here and it's good great stuff too by the way if you're looking flat

[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.460]
You a

[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.580]
You son of a fan the following is a paid public service announcement from the International White Public Association

[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:58.840]
Let's face most of us will never be rich. Hell we probably won't even be successful and that's pretty damn depressed

[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.280]
But as usual with every

[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.460]
I'm Jim and I'm here to tell you a little something about handguns

[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.660]
They scare the

[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:13.940]
Timmin' eight-dominant giving you whatever you want that's right handguns think about it

[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:21.080]
Need some cash? Probably don't have enough money for beer or the convenience store takes chips and pretzels wire at it

[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:26.600]
It's all free if you've got a handguns some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend kill him

[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:33.360]
Simple solution of life complex problems all you have to do is wait the five days for it and happiness is just around the court

[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.100]
Hell if you don't want to wait the five days who cares?

[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.600]
Buy the dancing of the street just buy a lot of handguns

[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.920]
It's a great alternative to working problem job and get it in a population control

[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.340]
Yes, handguns they just might make your face

[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:54.380]
Just like they said Godfather 3, wish Godfather was it he said something he might make you famous too

[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.120]
Godfather which one was it

[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.380]
1215 is 560 WK never got father three that they were in the Atlantic City

[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.840]
Hey, hey, it's Sunday what was his name the dog remember Vincent shot him off the horse

[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:13.140]
Come on quick quick he was on the horse they were having a guy named Dago for eight in the street there

[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.700]
And he said to him what are you called out his name and he said the Zaza well Joey Zaza

[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.300]
See I got to work this stuff out myself because you're in La La land

[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:26.740]
Sorry and when we're having the meeting in the Atlantic City there when the shantleers started it's a hit

[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.060]
He said yeah and sometimes he might make us all famous too

[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.500]
It's true that I have a bell off the good I right

[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.940]
Here's Fort Lauderdale hello

[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.600]
Hell yes sir

[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.520]
Hey, this is great show today

[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.880]
It's a good response on this

[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:51.620]
But yeah, I have anything that spoke about hockey players or yeah a lot of book and as far here we go

[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.720]
Here's the guy hockey on his ass yeah

[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000]
Fort Lauderdale and Brad already mentioned the marks that's perfect which you wouldn't know him because he's a hockey player

[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.140]
I already mentioned that

[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.140]
Plenty of other hockey players were scumbags but not nearly as many as football how do you like that I wonder what that's all about

[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:11.440]
How's Graham James doing by the way and the bad news is all he did was molest over a hundred young hockey player and kid

[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:17.200]
Graham James up there in Canada and they put him in jail for a couple of minutes and now he's out there on day really so much and up the other day

[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.960]
So he can go out and molest some kids in the daytime then go back to the good night sleep in the slam and a lot of them out again the next day to do some kids

[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.040]
Here's some solo

[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.540]
Hey, how are you doing okay sir

[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.580]
Home run on the topic today

[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:34.500]
Yeah, I think it all boils down to this is in sports anymore it's all about business and making money

[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.500]
Just as a couple examples

[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:42.520]
If you were for other nation for high-paying up and you fell a urine test you're going but you play for a football thing

[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.540]
You can beat the heck out of your girlfriend and it doesn't matter

[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:44.780]
Right

[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.520]
Same thing with Eddie DeBartolo

[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:53.720]
He's not what I admitted to Salon but he's allowed to have ownership in a football team wide because he didn't put the generate revenues for the NFL

[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.440]
That's right

[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:58.380]
That's good of Paul Allen who owns Microsoft or there was a co-founder

[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.460]
You think if somebody walked in the Microsoft and started choking him down

[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:05.040]
That they would get the same treatment that Richelps re-woked for the Portland Trailblazer

[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.700]
Another Mickey Manlo, Willie Mays, but they were doing stuff with some casino up there

[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:12.900]
They were connected right away and this is after their careers were early 70s

[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.480]
They were told that they would be out of the hall of fame

[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.620]
That's right because they were all about money, all about business

[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.020]
You got to put it out there

[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.000]
They're protecting their image

[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.900]
They don't care about the image of the players or when it's protecting their image as an institution because they're bigger than life

[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:29.640]
Exactly and what they do is the owners will sit back and say well you know it's a league policy

[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.040]
I can't do anything about it when that's just a bunch of garbage

[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.500]
And it all really boils down to a Miami and you're just a parenting at home

[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:39.380]
You know you don't have all bottles most with 50% of the whole expio

[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.700]
These guys are private for skidding but of course they're all by different women and these murdered any of them

[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.320]
But I guess I'm not picking out yet

[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.280]
What a niche the guy comes out of search and niches the way it is

[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:52.100]
And I'm not proud of it what it happened and it's there I'm like Clinton will put a hand in the table on a Bible

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.440]
And swear that nothing happens

[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.300]
So that's all I serve through that upper proof with all

[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.440]
Okay, have a great day, Stale YouTube

[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.200]
I don't understand what was he saying about Clinton there getting a blowjob and a blowjob

[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.860]
We have an open-ended power to block this even

[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.440]
Most people don't give a crap about the president sex life

[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:11.380]
In the fact that he's married to a US ice princess and has net sex with her in 14 years

[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.740]
Maybe we can understand a little more sympathetic and maybe he needs to get his rocks off once in a while

[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:16.780]
Okay, who cares?

[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.940]
And how that creeps into conversation I have no idea

[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.380]
But the president's not supposed to be a role model

[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.980]
He's supposed to be doing a job of running the country and keeping him from blowing a world up

[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:28.500]
That's all

[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.080]
He wants a chance president

[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.060]
I don't see anybody with any presidential baseball cards

[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.240]
They're using you to see those collect your president cards

[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.020]
I don't see those

[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.980]
Hey, Mr. President, can you sign your cards?

[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:38.760]
I don't see those

[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.860]
We have an open-ended Howard from wireless line

[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.240]
Here's Coral Springs, hello

[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.660]
Hello, Neil, how are you?

[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:46.920]
Great

[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:47.900]
Great show

[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.120]
You take over my interest so I have to call in

[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:51.500]
Okay

[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:55.860]
It wasn't because of the greatest job that I got out of the South Bronx

[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.580]
It was a ghetto in the 60s and 70s

[00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.620]
The grace of God

[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:04.340]
Exactly, and came to Florida eventually to raise my children here

[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:10.180]
It was because of the hard work and the sacrifice that my mother and father went through

[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.420]
I worked in two jobs and putting me through private schools to get a good education

[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:15.120]
There you go

[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:20.280]
Education is the basis of what we would say

[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:25.580]
It's the person that turned into a good citizen or remains in the ghetto

[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.380]
Well, my parents made a decision to get me out of the ghetto

[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.180]
So they are my heroes

[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.700]
Not these people that you can adjust to NHL, the NFL and baseball

[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.260]
Will be the downfall with the money

[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.300]
Because how much is enough?

[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.120]
This is supposed to be entertainment for us

[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.200]
Not ripping off the general public

[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.280]
I mean, this is like if your next door neighbor was always coming over knocking on the door

[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.440]
Could I borrow a company sugar?

[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.140]
Could I love borrow to five bucks for a bread money?

[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.620]
And then next day you walk over there and you see they got a new Cadillac in the driveway

[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:02.220]
And you're wondering how can they keep getting it all of this debt

[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.160]
And how can they keep spending money that they claim they're not making again?

[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.040]
And then next day there's another new Cadillac and they come back and they want $10

[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:08.720]
They want more

[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.920]
And that's making me sense

[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.580]
And more and more and more

[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.500]
The only way it's going to come to a screeching halt

[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:20.480]
And you're already seeing ample evidence of it is when the suckers out there stop subsidizing this crap

[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.940]
Because that's exactly what it is

[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.340]
And exactly what you're talking about

[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:28.580]
Because I did not pay a single cent last year to go to any single baseball game for Wayne

[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.480]
And my son is always asking me hey when was the other game? I'm sorry

[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.280]
They don't have any money for that guy

[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.180]
Maybe as they change ownership it'll happen

[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:41.520]
But the reason is you see all the things that happen on TV

[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.240]
And the things that you talk about in the book and it's an embarrassment

[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.260]
Now only only for them but for the leaves and the teams that they represent

[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.120]
And they're not going to get any of my money

[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.940]
My money goes to my son's education

[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.640]
And everybody have a nice day

[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.320]
Okay thanks

[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.980]
Good lunch today by the way thanks Tony

[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.680]
I'll provide it

[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.500]
Okay but when you got a place named Tony's you don't say thanks Brad

[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.840]
Thanks Brad at Tony's

[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.240]
Yes you do

[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.560]
Brad doesn't sound a tell you know

[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.660]
Maybe his name is Brad Donatello

[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:09.660]
Huh?

[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.520]
Maybe that's it

[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.780]
Brad could be a titan

[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.300]
Your first name could be here could be Saul

[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.080]
Huh?

[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.180]
Like Saul South Cone

[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.960]
Maybe even the Saul South Cone

[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.580]
Where who knows?

[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.520]
Open line in day five for this line

[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.260]
Of course he does just present a problem

[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.440]
Because if all those sports goes under then what they'll be going to do with a format of this guy damn radio state

[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.580]
That's the problem

[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.880]
I mean you're still punny that illegal stuff to gamble on

[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.620]
We don't have to worry about that

[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:34.280]
We don't have to be sports

[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.060]
We can go out here and gamble on the leaves holding off the tree out here

[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.840]
My uncle used to do that

[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.100]
Muggy Solomon he had to be too lazy to fall off with him

[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.240]
But maybe not quite that bad

[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.060]
He was a bookie

[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:44.840]
What's right there

[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.220]
Here's Miami hello

[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.160]
Hey Neil

[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:49.760]
Yes sir

[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.300]
Neil I brought this up one time I called the Mad Dog

[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.040]
And I'm just kind of fell on deaf ears

[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.600]
I like Mad Dog but he didn't really have anything

[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:02.960]
Why don't they push more in the NFL

[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.280]
For hey you cannot play in the NFL

[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.940]
So you have your bachelor's degree I mean they go to

[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.540]
I know it sounds naive

[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.600]
Were they on HL?

[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.400]
How about that

[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:17.300]
Well the NHL doesn't really claim that you don't have to go to college first to play in the NFL

[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:21.700]
But a college there's a few of them that come out of you know like Michigan State or BU maybe a half a dozen

[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:22.300]
Yeah but earlier

[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.300]
They're going to college

[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:28.400]
Yeah but earlier I got me a good poor he didn't didn't mean to but he made a good point by asking about the hockey players

[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.560]
And you said yeah but there's not that many incidents with hockey players for whatever reason

[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:37.000]
They don't have a... they're not as despicable characters in their private lives as he's in a NFL

[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.060]
Guys you already know

[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:42.380]
But just I mean why can't people just talk about them?

[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.640]
Why isn't it... why isn't that idea toyed around with more you know what I mean?

[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:51.400]
Because I mean you're talking about revamping our whole attitudes in a society about changing all of our priorities

[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.680]
There's a priority in education

[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:57.620]
The guy who's the egghead he's the one like Adelaide Stevens and he's the one people look at

[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:03.720]
He's an oddball he's a goofball he's you know very bright but he's out of line with the rest of us

[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.160]
They don't care about that guy

[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.000]
Yeah I know that

[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.820]
Let me say it again if I'm trying to think of somebody who if John Kenneth Galbary would have killed two people

[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:18.660]
And he was rafling in a white Ford Bronco from the scene

[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:24.260]
Nobody would have been running up and down the streets of wherever the hell he was with big science say go John go

[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:29.300]
They wouldn't have been doing that right but OJ being a sports hero being a jock

[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.060]
Being part of this whole mythology of American society

[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.040]
It's just put on a jock strap suddenly all of a sudden you're a hero

[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.460]
And if you can run real fast, run for a while to yark you're a hero no matter what kind of a scumbag you are

[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.780]
Then they're all running up and down the freeways there with big sir

[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:46.600]
That was one of the most embarrassing this place that will go down in the animals of American history

[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:51.420]
Because they got all the footage of it on tape as one of the most embarrassing chapters in history of this country

[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:56.440]
And it's a great revelation of what other thinking of too many people, millions of people in this country

[00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:02.680]
Well I think you said it though I think maybe the tide has turned a little bit

[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.260]
In other words they got now they can't claim anymore

[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:09.160]
And what I don't mean to say they is I'm just talking about blacks or whatever

[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:15.360]
But I mean let's face it the reason that whole OJ thing happened was the reaction to it was because they said

[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:21.880]
Hey how many times did black men get lynched and that kind of thing and white people cheered it on that kind of thing

[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.200]
So we're getting our revenge now

[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.980]
Okay, all right then we give you that then it happened

[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.360]
All right now is it a deed or are we playing on an even field now

[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.420]
It's like affirmative action let's stop for playing the blame game

[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.680]
Just like this article I read by David Horowitz the no more blame game

[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.600]
You want your own take responsibility for your own action

[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:45.700]
Get your own education earn your own job be able to a better job than the other people competing for it

[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.600]
That's it period no more no more handouts

[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:53.660]
Yeah and the other thing I was going to say the other thing I was going to say is that willy what's his name the mayor of terms system

[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:58.700]
I mean I didn't know he did that he did that I just lost all respect for that guy

[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.860]
I mean that's ridiculous him sticking up for free well over that guy is that pretty good

[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:03.720]
Well, freeing free well

[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.600]
All right now I have a great day and then of course with freeing free well

[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.560]
I have the hootspa that turn around and sue the NBA when they said no you lose your full of crap

[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.040]
Well, you know, let's refile the suit let's try it again

[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:20.980]
Because he's being treated unfairly even though they're going to allow him to come back and play again after he tried to choke his coach today

[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.660]
You got to understand man we need lots more anger management that's what it's all about

[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:32.360]
Anger management here we got big nasty angry guys you got to try to control them

[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:32.500]
Man

[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.480]
Two open lines in date five six seven up close to home

[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.280]
But Charles Jordan and

[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:45.100]
Lamar autonomous and others who are no longer here Lawrence Phillips serving spice

[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:50.420]
Frozen cons the criminals who play in the NFL by Jilla Q's dove including Michael Irvin and the others

[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.860]
Are they pale into what's significant compared to all the other stuff that's in here

[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.340]
So they might even up to snuff if I can say that

[00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.580]
Here's a mobile in Miami

[00:37:59.580 --> 00:37:59.820]
Hello

[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.600]
Mobile in Miami

[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:08.380]
Going once going twice. Here's a mobile in four Myers hello

[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.320]
Neil stolen a lot because of back and forth

[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.720]
You have a great topic today and what I would like to say about it is the following

[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:23.000]
Not only is it not an excuse to say that someone came from a poor background in

[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.980]
Grim the gutter but it's actually one of the most the meaning things you can say with regard to people who live in that situation

[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:36.680]
Right essentially you're saying look you are not the same quality human being we cannot accept the same level of moral behavior from you

[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:41.720]
So we are going to go back to the godfather one again when they're having the heads of the five families are having that meeting

[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:47.140]
And they're talking about you know not letting drugs near schools etc and so on are they going to get in the drug business

[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:54.540]
And the one guy from Kansas City I guess it was whatever it was talking about the blacks well their animals anyway let them lose their souls

[00:38:54.540 --> 00:39:04.480]
Exactly exactly if I would if I had come from that background or a fire like the gentleman who called a few callers back who had been able to rise a thought that I would be out

[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:11.540]
Raged at the suggestion that because someone grew up in those circumstances there's no reason to affect moral behavior from that right it is

[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:18.960]
It's it's coming in if somebody kills your wife or your kid or god forbid you know anybody in your family or somebody you care about

[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.600]
Do you care if that person grew up in a ghetto is that going to be an excuse?

[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:30.760]
Absolutely irrelevant I mean as Susan Smith because of the fact that she grew up as a is a trailer park trash subliterate piece of garbage in South Carolina

[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.140]
Is that an excuse that she drowndered to kid?

[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:42.400]
It's an insult to every honest person every moral person who's living that life right this minute and is not turning into a criminal or some kind of a raking murdering animal

[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.640]
Yeah great great show Neil great show today

[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:50.200]
Have a great day YouTube and it's a great book like I said I only read a few page post radio

[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:58.720]
But you get the drift you get the gist of it you get the message here I think open line and date county fast line

[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.200]
Here's for a lottery oh hello

[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:10.360]
For a lottery oh yes sir I for fun caller all right long time listen yep I'm going to Vegas getting the hell out of here

[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:15.880]
Mm-hmm I'm out there a couple times because my mom moves out there works for that word the airlines that you're alive

[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.940]
America worst yeah

[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:23.520]
Boy first time we're gonna see in Caesar salad right anyway it's a point because I'm half a time half Colombian

[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.880]
And remember that college got a couple days because the asshole went down to a Colombian

[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:35.060]
Oh yeah the answer from four miles you call two days in a row right he probably deserved it was great claim to fame is that he you know hates Colombians

[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.300]
Yeah well he probably deserved it yeah I agree

[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:46.000]
I love the Colombian people like they said in Godfather Colombian people are a wonderful people are they never store free train

[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.080]
I was I'm like that they said I was gonna try to drag out my lover to come and see you tomorrow yeah so I'll see you tomorrow

[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:57.380]
No okay but don't bring him in drag though okay see you said come in and drag we have an open line and

[00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:05.980]
Broward five seconds here's a mobile in West Palm Beach hello hey Neil yes sir man I know I'm good to talk to a person

[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:12.960]
Those were without hockey here but I'm a seasoned Panther holder and I know you were yeah I am so

[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:20.500]
This uh as the Mario Brothers yeah I mean these guys I like that the Mario Brothers yeah I mean the

[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:25.720]
Mario Brothers I mean that's the only game in town is the Mario game on a computer I mean there's no game on the

[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:30.360]
I'm yeah I mean it looks like a figure skating forming out there they're having a little

[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:37.600]
contact out there and everybody's spinning around don't go lay lessons I mean that is here they suffer from a lack of

[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:43.480]
talent I told you that before the season started this is a roster you look up and down and it's just

[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:49.500]
same old story again a couple of promising youngsters in the organization who may or may not turn out to be

[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:55.180]
real good players but there is no nucleus of a team you look at any other team and league even teams that

[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:59.220]
have good young players they're a second and third and fourth year young players before we need

[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:05.300]
developing like on relief like Sergei Burz and Alan McCauley and uh Frederic Modin not just a

[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:09.580]
whole bunch of rookies which they've been feeding us this bullcraft year after year all the kids in

[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:14.480]
the organization and and unfortunately for us most of them never pan out anyway and we got a lot

[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:19.380]
of old steps out there like Garf and Maher and Kirk Morris and Ganya and he's guys that nobody will

[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:23.920]
take from us nobody wants them and then that's it you have a roster that has no talent no

[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:29.100]
but yet coaching that has no talent right and you know but not only that but coaching now

[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:33.840]
they not only has no talent but that's got a chip on a shoulder this guy turns out to be nothing

[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.260]
at all like what I thought he was the more I hear from people about Terry Murray he's a real hard

[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:42.760]
ass the players don't like him he walks around with a chip on his shoulder if you look at him

[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:47.060]
cross-eyed he's gonna sit you out and uh Root I want to you know and then stay in age the way

[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:51.480]
athletes uh think these days they're not gonna play for somebody like that no absolutely not and

[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:56.540]
his brother who's the GM I mean we have far down here we had a winning team and we had nobody

[00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:01.260]
yeah but I mean but he could put the nobody out there and they would hit people get

[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:05.320]
for the fine unit time and there was a boring team to watch but they played the

[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:09.560]
trap and they played that real slow ponderous low scoring board and you know I guess it was

[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.180]
necessary at that time because if we try to play wide open we'd have gotten slaughtered and

[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:17.400]
you know in order to compete we had to do that but now it's your number six we've had a lot of

[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.280]
talented people come and go on this team like Barnes and like Wally and like Strockin

[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.540]
Shepherd and a lot of other guys and now this is the product of what for this is his team now

[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:29.900]
it can't play Bobby Clark or anybody else this is Brian Marie's team this is what he's been put

[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:35.900]
together hard garbage gold tending no offense a so a defense that has become as porous as a

[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:40.900]
sip you basically got a 20 guys out there who stand around and watch the other team play and I'm

[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:45.700]
gonna tell you these next three games tonight and tomorrow and Monday if this team doesn't find

[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:50.720]
some miracle to turn around it's gonna be much worse than last year well then yeah I agree with

[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:55.140]
you and I think I thought last year was as bad as it could get this is gonna be much worse

[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.100]
yeah but you know what I'd rather paint cheaper and go through the madador's play okay

[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.060]
I'm gonna walk that to the hockey okay they're playing tonight right see

[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:08.900]

oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line i mean we had the you know a ton of calls

[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:20.460]

[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:25.200]
talking about you know it seems that the people make their opinion based upon what happens

[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:30.320]
by the event of people right makes one of the reporters and if someone's book in the house and

[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:35.400]
killed his wife kitty do talk with you to the same wife and even mind if it was Kim

[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:40.720]
Martin but if it was really hurting you be up so it's basically ridiculous i think people need to

[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:49.200]
pay their opinion as this thing's happening to them and not the elsewhere

[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:58.140]
yes yes i find that i'm part of a rare breed just like my discussion about the arena and a

[00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:01.460]
little minor complaint about the ambiance in the answer the things they would do in a big

[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.740]
complaint about the noise for once they stray in that uh so i don't have to stand up for other

[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:09.300]
people but if you only look through at life through my epic eyes and you only see things as they

[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:14.980]
affect you then uh all that doesn't make you stupid and selfish absolutely no and have a very good

[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.440]

open lines in date five is a mobile in west palm beach hello okay nice talking to you too

[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:59.680]
here's my name hello hey deal yes sir um kind of wanted to mention one thing uh linking some things

[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:06.800]
together from earlier in the morning um i think education is the key who thinks that he can take a

[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:13.320]
big corporation dump some funds into a fat part of the city to go to school like hard charter school

[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:18.320]
problem is that uh you have to get lots of other corporations doing the same thing or to keep

[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:26.380]
that happening um i for i think i mean uh mean problem is and uh hopefully we can find the

[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:31.040]
way to get around that oh we're not going to find a way to get around because nobody cares about

[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:34.680]
it's not it's not a priority and that you know that's all lip service you know Clinton talks all

[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.180]
about education we're gonna have a hundred thousand new teachers and bush and macaire scream

[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:42.280]
about education but uh it's not a priority i mean the public is willing to sit back and allow

[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.920]
their kids to continue getting a half-ath education and allow illiterate superintendents and

[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.660]
principals to run school who can't even speak proper English and have no idea what they'll uh

[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:54.820]
couldn't add the two and two of their lives dependent on it and they just goes on that's all there

[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:59.540]
there's no interest well unfortunately i think that the interest is more and uh keep and sports

[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:03.300]
teams around and they'll know that they have to start to get a little bit warmer pal we've got to

[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:08.200]
keep the franchises we can't lose our franchises we have to build a new stadium on every street corner

[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:12.860]
a new arena on every street corner and we have to continue subsidizing this because this is the

[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:16.880]
important stuff now you're getting warm or how many how many schools the brothers county's built

[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:22.360]
with uh 200 million probably yeah right well and i know you know if you if you really have the

[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:27.840]
drive to do what you can do it but uh it seems like uh what i interested in that you got it all right

[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:31.000]
now i have a good take how many schools the weight of bill for us uh for underneath

[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.480]
tremendous have a great faith okay man okay daydeline to roll open i guess they did their

[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:39.080]
duty for today they've been actually pretty much almost involved for a change that's unusual five

[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:42.960]
step one line hank will be here with two we got managed at six and the panthers tonight and

[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:47.940]
the black cocks in Chicago anybody excited about that no anybody fired up and uh no hi doubted

[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:53.700]
could be real ugly again better not be because if this trend continues here you know that brand new

[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:57.860]
arena he's talking about we could have a lot of elbow room those of you screaming about your small

[01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:01.540]
baby neuro seat you may have you may be able to uh sit wherever you want pretty soon if it keeps

[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:08.400]
up like this here's a mobile and hi lia hello nil yes sir you know i think your way off base with

[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:13.860]
this uh you know this book pros and cons yeah now these are pretty much isolated incidents you

[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:17.920]
know the i think that's not an incident that 21 percent of the players in the national football

[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:22.500]
league are convicted felons listen these guys do come from the ghetto they do have rough

[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:27.240]
lives they need a second isolated incidents over and over again and no matter how many times they

[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:31.120]
do it like the martylamus the coaches long as they can play looks the other way that's an isolated

[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:36.480]
incident well maybe they need to see a good freeze yeah okay great there you go see try just

[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:44.260]
another wise ojohn provocateur no material because you see you can you can't mess with these people

[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:49.200]
and have this jock mentality i'm never going to change them there this is their life don't you

[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.340]
understand this is the only thing that counts it's the only thing that's important

[01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:58.660]
and so they can rationalize anything if one of the players from the dolphins came to their door

[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:02.040]
right now they went on a plane to Buffalo where we're going to lay off if they if they uh came to

[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:06.020]
their door right now it's fit in their face and uh still some other guy them uh living room

[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:09.260]
well you know uh times your tough to confuse their inner lot of stress

[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:16.420]
they will rationalize anything away for their heroes because they're the ones who make them feel

[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:21.440]
better about themselves just like a just like this college football crap and boy that's exactly

[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:27.200]
what it is my school it's like a song with hookup bram my religion's better than my school's

[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.180]
better than your you know we're gonna kick your ass you know jojohn florida much of y'all who's

[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:37.000]
a bunch of crafters bunch of uh red red next gotta kick your ass yeah and and then what what does

[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:44.380]
that prove does it prove anything no okay two open lines in the days like that call i had years

[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:50.220]
ago and i dumped it today i wouldn't dump it guy from a uofm the kid that called in very articulate

[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:55.120]
white student from the uofm which is unusual i realize articulate from uofm rassy moire

[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.240]
and he was talking about uofm football and back in those days of course they were kicking ass

[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:02.820]
winning all their games and he said well you know what you can't help but we got the big nigs

[01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:08.240]
and i dumped it back to that i wouldn't dump it today because i mean it speaks for itself

[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:14.580]
we all were exposed to the n-word nigger which you're not supposed to say but n-word we had to say

[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:20.260]
because you can't say nigger and uh you know during the uofm trial for two years so now we could

[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:26.280]
let it go see and then make so different the people who are the so-called fans they don't care

[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:29.720]
about who these people are as long as they can play well they don't want them living in their

[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:34.280]
neighborhood so that's for damn sure there are plenty of people playing on her coupons and on the

[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:37.720]
dolphins today that many of the people in our audience would now want to have them live the next

[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.180]
door right here and see no matter how fancy the house they built or what have you they don't want

[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:46.980]
them in their hood but so long as they can play well out there that's all accounts because then

[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:52.600]
they make them feel better about themselves we won we're number one we as if somehow they got

[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:58.580]
something to do with it here's a mobile implantation hello hey Neil yes sir hey i was with you

raping and everything and whatever else they're doing that that's gotten that's not just the

[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:38.700]

panthers and the whole battle with hyzenge and herison and ever since then all you see in the news as

Francis games tonight so they could break needle-mire's nose again and he'll be out for the year okay

[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:29.380]
hey hey hey hey hey you know something there's something to think about stop and think about

[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:33.940]
that that's one way good about a lineup because the man it's interesting no matter how badly he played

[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:39.440]
he guys worse and worse and worse all we get our stories and excuses did they ever said his

[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.240]
ass down on the bench oh they've ever been talking about that oh no oh well you know it's back

[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:48.480]
to that concussion last year in lindross or maybe when coming to him in the Chicago game or maybe

[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:53.500]
this year when the zeroff hit him in Tampa Bay is always some excuse and then he says oh no i'm fine

[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:58.900]
i just need to uh motivate my and of course he can't do it now he's fine when they were going to

[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:04.220]
trade his assets around oh thank god then he was having headaches and he wasn't 100% and the headaches

[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:07.440]
were coming back because he was too much of a pussy to leave here and go to a place where they really

[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:12.200]
know hockey i'm telling you i got guaranteed you right now if he with a fat trade would have gone

[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:15.880]
through we'd be in better shape because we'd have Felix pop in we'd have a real golium then

[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:20.560]
that's what's going to be good for us but even now just a few weeks later he'd be sitting up there

[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.120]
on young street in jurana sitting underneath one of those stores

[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:29.100]
fairison change mister that's what he would be doing and you look down there would be

[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:35.120]
a little guy from medicine hat well big guy now robbing you the box fairison change oh sorry oh

[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:43.120]

[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:57.700]
history tonight now and then we got a real real interesting performance receiving eight o'clock

[01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:01.460]
to pregame eight thirty answers at Chicago to play sing notoriously goody black hogs

[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:08.400]
large duty again this year but they're not too good here's for a lot of day oh hello you know

[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:14.700]
yes or one journal uh generally once I let you know that uh was in Toronto on Monday cut

[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:18.620]
there my first game it's the uh the garden oh i'm sorry I had to see that game that was pretty

[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:22.740]
weak well I gotta tell you those eight eight plates that school drill was on fire but they played

[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:27.900]
pretty well I mean it i don't think i didn't think so no i played well our first five minutes and

[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:31.920]
after that the thing was well of them like stink on the way yeah if it get that good i've got

[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.640]
to work and they played this year i guess later played great you write it yeah happy Saturday

[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:39.460]
and maybe a tone for a sentence by playing good on Monday yeah i was gonna say that that

[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:45.380]
that's a fairly certainly is not the most attractive place i mean compared to what we have like

[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:50.620]
you know the uh atmosphere in there oh yeah new and good to you but as far as the ambiance in

[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:55.100]
there it's 50 it's a million times more than this one a lot for him you don't compare it yeah and

[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:58.920]
it's really it's just uh phenomenal yeah i think about that and it is in which you notice that when

[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:02.580]
the game started everybody was in their seat and the while the moon was going down it was sitting

[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:06.220]
in the pain of tension the game by the refreshments in between periods and when the second period

[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:09.620]
started they were all back in their seat absolutely right i've known any of them for

[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:13.900]
any while the game was going on no question no question now it was a great experience yeah i just

[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:18.700]
finally know okay glad you had a good time nothing like it baby up till February 20th

[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:21.820]
the next year and then again we got to have a new arena because we got to have more money in

[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:25.400]
the least spot the rafters they're going to make more money than god and they got to stop playing

[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:31.340]
a maple leaf garden because no more there no more that see as the old stadiums and the old arenas

[01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:35.780]
go down the tubes and by the way side not necessarily because they're falling apart or because they're

[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:41.860]
it's just that they can't make enough money because it's an endless demand how much like when i

[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:46.180]
start hearing people say but they're on michael jordan he's worth 80 million a year 50 peace

[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:51.240]
from one well based on how much revenue we can generate well let the revenue go to somebody else

[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:56.180]
okay he don't need 50 million a year he don't need 80 million a year and my piazza don't need

[01:15:56.180 --> 01:16:02.300]
13 million dollars a year i bet you could scrape by on ten somehow i don't know let me ask you

[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.880]
you people out there in the audience can if there anybody out there in this audience

[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.520]
that's great by a nine ten million a year low i didn't think i didn't know i mean i realized

[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:17.380]
i'm unrealistic so seriously if i could if i could get that much money for one year 13 million a year

[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:27.040]
first year so listen to me what's the 60% of that 7.8 7.8 million so i'd save seven million of it

[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:33.480]
and then i quit what's wrong with that that's a half a million dollars a year just i mean

[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:39.480]
interest the rest of your life don't need more do i need more no no it's gonna be three four

[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:45.300]
houses is that half a million year the rest of your life i think i could somehow scrape by on it

[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:50.400]
i'd have to lower my friends and stay there but here's the mimey lake so low

[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:56.700]
yeah what's wrong with the gildies yes sir speaking of gildi i gotta tell you a gildy story okay

[01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:01.360]
i'd like to work with my wife so i'd play Howard on the man he starts getting too

[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:05.640]
wrong she she hits the button putting on some jazz the wasn't shaving the crotch again wasn't

[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:10.920]
well he was doing just the picking out the belches and the parts and everything and she can't stand

[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:16.260]
yeah like that so anyway he's doing belches and parts on that show now what does that

[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:22.380]
there's big now yeah yeah so she puts jazz on i says listen what we have to compromise let me

[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:27.120]
put on the first team oh boy she listens to goldies voice you know what she did she turned

[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:31.120]
on back she put Howard right back on she said i don't know listen to this let me tell you why do

[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:34.400]
you think how it's going to the roof the last book all the people who hear the worst thing when they

[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.660]
hear that voice they immediately punch back over to Howard he's had to probably the biggest

[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:41.780]
book he ever had in this market because gildies on there well what do they gonna hear riddles

[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:49.760]
okay it's we have an open line of day these guys doesn't understand they did he's got the pictures

[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:58.360]
don't you understand of the beastly brothers red read in a moose I mean you know I I don't

[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:03.780]
want to infringe on anybody else's ability to earn a living okay but when I'm driving to work

[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:07.780]
on those very cases when I can listen and as soon as they get into either the gators or some

[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:12.520]
other thing that I have no interest in my music goes in the cd player but when I hear gildy doing

[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:18.040]
live commercials and this is the truth i'm not exaggerating at that point I want to spark the

[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:23.280]
car pull over the side of the car get out of the car sit down on the curb and just start reading

[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:32.020]
and that is no live it is no exaggeration you know what i mean that that would be like

[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:37.880]
Lenny Lenny not you do just those tags on there because we have nobody else

[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:41.680]
about the pd to lazy and to absent all the time to be doing that which he ought to be doing

[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:48.180]
if we got nobody to do it that would be like a little Lenny over there I've made into a superstar

[01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:52.020]
by the way I can't do it yeah him doing live spot

[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:58.300]
me and you all right that would be like even I'm sorry Lenny I apologize it like Robert

[01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:05.020]
the grim gripper doing eight and nine spy hey that buying nine nine you can't hamburger he didn't

[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:11.320]
make down on what's wrong with that for two ninety nine I mean these are there's our nice people

[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:15.800]
they just can't speak and I think you're starting to get a little bit a little bit pushy when you

[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:20.080]
expect people to be on this station doing live endorsements for advertisers who want to spend a lot

[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:26.380]
of money and get results they expect somebody to be able to speak those wrong with you here's a mobile

[01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:32.160]
in bokeh hello how you doing great I got to set out with a traffic report um ninety five just

[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:38.320]
a house of four-still boulevard I've been in just traffic stop and go for about a half hour and

[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:42.380]
I haven't gone anywhere you know that I once lived on four-still boulevard when I worked at WJN

[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:47.460]
always Mrs. Sucket Experience four-still boulevard it's a nightmare mom you know what you're doing

[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:52.260]
you're quick to dismiss you know maybe make your work place go yeah that's true let's get

[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:55.820]
them back on there let's sign them up you know he's not doing anything else in fact let's just

[01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:59.780]
strap them up and that sounds good to me we don't need the uniform just strap it with me to my

[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:05.560]
if he's a big guy putting him in goal okay so this is just I mean when I thought he said then

[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:10.460]
actually turning the wrong way yeah we need to we're trying to really you know you don't even

[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:15.600]
wait man you don't understand it's a new arena they're lost they're used to going the other way

[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:19.460]
no matter what the idea is they're used to skating the other direction they need to come

[01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:24.160]
this in a roadmap I mean if you see that I have a there I saw it I was there what it means

[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:29.060]
that I see it I saw it I was screaming at it and have a great day felt calm down of course

[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:32.580]
but see there's gonna be in Chicago then they're gonna be in where's it on how we night if

[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:37.060]
it gonna be in Jersey and then the others on Monday then back home for the black off

[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:42.240]
next one the I can't wait I cannot wait for that night

[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:49.380]
this is a mind out of black okay so maybe you'll continue with it so far so far

[01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:54.240]
it's a pretty mediocre thing except for this one I'm proving no great shape and then let's

[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:57.140]
look like see I keep you're always sitting there what you know it was in a trip right

[01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:00.800]
way so they are great or I got news for I've got proven great they don't even have their best

[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:04.780]
player Paul Valle Bully and the plan they do have Messia and the Goli but other than that they

[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:09.980]
show a great snow is playing good in the net but they're not great and they may just look

[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:16.200]
just about as bad as just try it this is embarrassing this is violating because it's a lack of

[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:24.420]
talent because it's the team that's the Maurice Bill our patty-mouge one maybe if she loses

[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:28.380]
that lesson out there where I choose they in the Washington State if you'll bring patty-mouge

[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:33.940]
you can do the GMN of course you have brought them up 60 you a m

[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:44.580]
let's get rid of Jerry Starner he's he's not improving he just brings down more crap as

[01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:49.680]
always does there's just crap everywhere when you look in this room I thought maybe I

[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:53.000]
hit him like straight down a little bit as far as giving me some real top in and I realize I'm

[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.280]
looking at this stuff and it's garbage just wreck you just teach you right in the same stuff

[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.620]
and putting out a different size paper a different size typewriter a different whatever

[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:06.420]

[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:13.080]
people in the market put together you're still know nothing about a piece of copy and giving

[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:21.180]
us anything you're hopeless here's a mobile in the key hello hello yes sir yes

[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:31.980]

[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:55.360]
the college and professional athletes have you listen to some of their interviews yes I mean

[01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:00.020]
I think there is some of it yeah well here a lot of things oh that's a lot of thing this

[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:03.060]
guy before talking about they got to have a degree what does it make when the degree is in

[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:07.620]
basket weaving or whatever hell else it is uh you know most yeah you know I went to school back

[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:10.540]
when we were doing the same thing a white shawl haunt as you can say they're all a bunch of

[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:15.120]
you literates more on unbelievable yes they're having a lot of textbook most of well it just seems

[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:19.220]
right there I bought the school I just didn't bother going to class yes the children of gangsters

[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:23.500]
and I'm thinking why not to have their own gangster league and do right in the movie blood sports

[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:29.880]
right of the death yeah there you go while we work on in fact the extreme football and this guy's

[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.660]
got an idea regular stuff hangover too big ratings are weighed down and it's by waiting by

[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:38.940]
tells you they're weighed down because most of the games are real boring terminal coma inducing

[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:44.040]
oh you can't say that okay I won't say it or have it a good time like I said before the whole

[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:48.480]
thing is just keep convincing yourselves you have it a great time this is great like being in the

[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:54.120]
fact the path of giving it the night I kept saying god this is dynamite where we'd be going let's

[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:43.940]
and uh I have no I have a WQAM signal fire report three days a week I drive up from golden

[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:48.600]
glazed to about 10 bro for over 441 and you were coming in loud and queer clear learn queer

[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:54.640]
that's about an hour ago I'm 441 yes oh my god maybe we could afford to pay the whole electric

[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:58.780]
bill this month right I figured maybe uh that's where George's bonus went or else the bird

[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:02.480]
craft the other side of the end of the year you ordinarily what they do they only pay about 70%

[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:06.460]
of the electric bill every month because this company is real slow on pay so they only allow 70%

[01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:10.840]
of our signal coverage which leads out most of 441 well I do that do only three quarters of my

[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:18.080]
house lights up exactly and Nia closing pool pod garage life and retired out get a life okay see

[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:26.080]
yeah here's a Miami hello hello yes sir yes Nia I want to mention about some political information

[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:33.000]
I was receiving through a mail here yes um it turns they say this like a vote yes on amendment

[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:39.460]
three because it provides an extra twenty five thousand dollars tax exemption for

[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:45.620]
yeah we're going to have to call for old parts right over 65 are you over 65 I'm almost but I'm

[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:49.960]
going to vote against it and here's the reason yes sir I feel that it's going to put a heavy

[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:55.400]
tax burden on people who are younger than 65 through themselves are hard up and so it's

[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.920]
incorrect yeah and I feel it's being unfair of balancing thank you many got all these

[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:05.080]
millionaires let's do it by income and not by age okay no more age discrimination in Florida if

[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:08.500]
you can afford to pay pay off that's all and if you can make it millions of dollars you got

[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:12.820]
millions in a bag no more social security stop training this country dry all these damage fastings

[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:18.560]
and here's the other thing then they say vote yes on on revision seven yeah for the court

[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:24.820]
state for bug the court system but now the question is here I have is number one they don't

[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:29.960]
mention that it also opens the door for your judges to be a point in other words be political

[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:34.900]
hack yeah I'm told to be elected well like I said just say no like Nancy said thank you here's Miami

[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:41.800]
hello hello yes sir me oh great show uh real quickly here uh this thing about it stadiums and

[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:46.840]
arenas uh back when the day county government was run out of the civic center they have the day

[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:52.540]
county master plan in a public state you could walk right up and look at it right something moved

[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:57.240]
over to government center which is 10 years ago now they never put the math back up so all of these

[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:02.940]
big planning decisions are being made and there is no place where a public person can just walk

[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:07.340]
up and take a look at the master plan of day county because there isn't can't complain about it because

[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:10.820]
there isn't any right well that's that could be true but they should have a little more maybe they

[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:14.060]
haven't been maybe the non-group is meeting down there with all those assholes from the herald

[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:18.060]
others glam and maybe the non-group has got the master plan in a broom closet somewhere and they're

[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:23.280]
like all working on it behind the scenes and the plan too they're working on it so let me just

[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:26.700]
ask you this and closing from what's been a pretty dang good week here generally speaking especially

[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:30.700]
when the phone works with it didn't one day well Greg's been out and he only said a cold in the program

[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:36.700]
director's on vacation but anyway uh it's been it's been okay it's had its moments but let me just

[01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:40.280]
ask you this to pond around don't forget Ben and Jerry's tomorrow by the way noona too but think

[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:45.400]
about this over the weekend okay when I first came here 23 years ago this city had minis stadium

[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:49.920]
with those little baby orals and we had the orange ball that was it there were no other I mean

[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:55.040]
there was lock-hard but there was no like other big glitzy stadiums arenas there was no nothing

[01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:02.020]
is this town better or worse today 23 years later with the stadiums and the arenas and the american

[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:04.220]
airlock oh there you go have a nice life
