[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.120]
You know one of the most disgusting things I think I've ever seen in my life was just sitting

[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.800]
in looking in the other room they're hamming it up for the cameras again.

[00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.200]
Joe Costello's over here getting a little training.

[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.620]
He's got his training brought on and of course anybody's got a brawn.

[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.720]
That's good enough for George and George is sitting there right behind a

[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.800]
massaging Joe's which I thought was the most grotesque thing I've ever seen.

[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.400]
Hey Spig and a grotesque we got some grotesque stuff here today including

[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.640]
we got the Miz Anna the black inflatable party sheep.

[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.700]
All right what we're going to be back on see this is the big news this is

[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.560]
an honor of our celebratory thing we're having here today because Monday this is one of the great

[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.660]
accomplishments in my checkered career.

[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.460]
This is a miracle.

[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.100]
Don't you understand what a tremendous accomplishment this is.

[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.500]
We're going back on here for Myers on Monday from tendinune.

[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.580]
Of course from noon they got to put that religious crap on there because it's paid for

[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.060]
and until that preacher runs out of gas or money or both.

[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.940]
As you run out of gas not yet.

[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.740]
They'll probably have that crap on there from noon to two but nevertheless because we finally see

[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.480]
what makes this so momentous is that this is a radio station.

[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.160]
WWCN770 on the dial good signal no ratings ever I mean they it's like they don't exist.

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.820]
It's a beastly state there while there you go it's a beastly operation over there in Fort Myers.

[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.520]
Never show up in a ratings inevitably in the last rating book when we were still on over there

[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.300]
before they started panicking and get real weak need and nervous because they had two calls from

[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.240]
the FFA the Florida whatever that F stands for association the Florida or his association.

[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.060]
So they got all panicky and put that paid religion on there oh we better not put you know cut the

[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.060]
crap okay so the ratings come out and guess what we finally showed up and it's that bag over

[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.240]
there in Miami he's the one got it some listings over here it's a major miracle.

[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.500]
So Georgia's doing a show on Monday and of course they probably don't know that yet because

[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.220]
they're totally out of it but he gets to talk not only to people over here but the people in

[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.380]
Fort Myers so we got the black inflatable party sheet for that our friends over in Lutz are going

[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.360]
to be listed all right grease her up for Monday speaking of grease her up I got so much stuff to

[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.040]
talk about today including yesterday and experience of a lifetime I saw the new arena the way

[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.660]
in arena. I'm gonna just call it that I'm gonna call it the Macarena hey that's a good idea we

[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.120]
just had big MacLeave time let's call it the Macarena I like that seriously what's wrong with

[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.580]
that even though he probably won't never be going there it's the Macarena and this place is so

[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.960]
beautiful you just aren't gonna believe it it is so spectacular and they tell me it's the best

[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.180]
in all of North America you know something I haven't been in many of them of course in fact

[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.520]
there only been in a few but it's gotta be there can't be any place more unbelievably beautiful

[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.220]
and those of you hockey fans out there which there may be a couple all of this article in the

[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.800]
paper today says there's only a couple of people like hockey and rest of them like figure skating.

[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.160]
Do you see this thing the survey yeah they did a survey because of the impact of the home run race

[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.680]
on baseball so the Associated Press did this telephone survey of a thousand people nationwide 37

[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.260]
percent of those people pulled said they followed baseball but only 11 percent said they chose

[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.720]
baseball as their favorite sport they watch enjoying the most nearly 40 percent chose guess what

[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.820]
professional football what a surprise huh well about 20 percent chose professional baseball 20

[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:15.260]
percent or basketball rather 20 percent selected figure skating and only 6 percent chose

[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:23.480]
professional hockey isn't that pathetic isn't that sad isn't that a 20 percent selected figure

[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.220]
skating who the hell did they interview the god damn bullshawy ballet I mean what are we talking

[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.080]
about over here they do this interview with Charles Nelson Riley's house figure skating

[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.400]
and 6 percent said hockey was number one but be that as it may I'm not deterred that doesn't bother me

[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.020]
I couldn't care less because this place is so unbelievable I when you see it and I have great

[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.080]
news for those of you who are a paddocky that wound up in the upper deck or in seats other than what

[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.640]
you thought you were going to wind up sitting on or that was your first choice doesn't make any

[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.660]
difference there are no bad seats in the macarena none I mean every seat has got a there are

[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.200]
sightlines that are so great and I'm not just saying this because I'm doing a hose job for anybody

[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.500]
it just happens to be true and I said in my seats by the way yesterday I put my big fat ass and my

[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.780]
big fat seater in section 101 running the NBA I'll seats one and two and I said all right this is

[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.060]
great right there at center ice and the ice is down by the way too and we went on every level we

[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.980]
scoured every part every orifice in that place and you just aren't going to believe it when

[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.100]
you see it they've got that magnificent which it was not for any yesterday for this huge big

[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.180]
clock with the other than that crap we had in the Miami arena where you couldn't see the replay

[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.800]
or anything on the damn thing which was the most embarrassing piece of garbage in the history mankind

[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.720]
was like looking at stuff to barbed wire which is the way in the way in the way in like

[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.880]
sit that way but this is state of the art it's spectacular it's sensational and a little frosting

[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.360]
on the cake well let me tell you first the great story about who was there on Wednesday I was

[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.360]
supposed to go there Wednesday but I guess I find out now why I didn't make my thing on my tour

[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.920]
through there on Wednesday because my good buddy was there on Wednesday my best buddy in the whole

[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:13.660]
goddamn world was at the macarena checking it out and so he naturally wants to go and sit his ass

[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.500]
and one of those is a great plus seats and they are plushed by the way very comfortable and great

[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.800]
and this is a true stir I'm not making this up and so Wayne sits down right there in the seat

[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.540]
squarely and guess what the seat breaks and Wayne falls on his rectum all right nice going

[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.920]
way in sweetheart I think God is a pain of back I think there's a message in there Wayne

[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.980]
so yesterday at the arena I get to meet for the second time a great guy by the way I said it

[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.480]
before I'll say it again no matter what happens on the season Terry Murray a great guy our new coach

[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.540]
and Terry has he's not a BSR or a BM artist either I mean he just happens to be a really good guy

[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.080]
and we sat down and I talked about this one sucks and he said yeah you're right now when

[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.040]
you know I'm not going to repeat what he said on the air but he knows the lay of the land he

[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.060]
understands what's going on and then got to meet some of the other people Billy Smith was in there

[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.640]
it was great then we go to the locker room I wanted to make sure I found out where we're waiting

[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:14.340]
these locker is and then we went up to the next floor me and Rimmer the rim man and you'll never

[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:20.300]
guess two of my biggest fans to my closest personal friends were up there to meet and greet me in their

[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:27.720]
offices Brian Marie and built tory there you go and we had a yuck session man that was just

[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.140]
unbelievable it was great my good buddies Brian Marie comes over to me he looks in both pockets in my

[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:38.260]
shirt to see if I had any BM buttons on me and I said no Brian I'm not going to give those

[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.960]
dear because you never know when they might come in handy and then built tory came over

[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.420]
supporting that stupid about time we had a yuck up that we just yucked it off they're good guys

[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:52.780]
they are you know very sensitive very thin skin but nevertheless and we talked about the pot

[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.100]
fan deal and why it fell through and what about your assholes they are up in Toronto and of course

[00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:03.180]
I already know that and what can I say it's just a magnificent place when you see this place when

[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:08.160]
you go inside and the greatest thing of the whole deal this is the number one thing for me

[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.280]
you saw the fact that it's two minutes walking for my house practically the best part of the whole

[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.660]
deal is the toilets that's right the turlits which they're having the testing on that tomorrow did

[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.680]
you read about that Rick Shaw they're having a whole bunch of kids over there and they're all going

[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.620]
to flush at the same time now I didn't I didn't read the whole article are they actually going to be

[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:31.160]
on there and then flushing or they just do it like a little test is it just a dry run so to speak

[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.200]
so they're going to have like hundreds of kids and they're all going and then Ricky Tiki who

[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.540]
better than to be the toilet man then Ricky Tiki is going to be flipping out cap of his everybody

[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:48.120]
flush now come on there you go but at the end of every exit I mean every section there is a big

[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.460]
if they like alternate one section there like ladies rooms and then the next section for guys and

[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.800]
then there's one also that says like gone decided just got question marks on it for many of our

[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.700]
hockey fans who haven't decided which way they're going yet but it's great every section has got

[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.880]
tea rooms right there at the end it's fantastic magnificent in fact I wouldn't be surprised if they

[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:13.200]
have a tea dance the first weekend it's a brand new amacarina so you're going to be mighty impressed

[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.360]
I'll tell you that and even those of you who think you're up in the nose bleed or away up high

[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.640]
good news for it because I went way up there too no problem at all you will see everything you'll

[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.460]
have a panoramic view and it's not like you're a million miles away you don't you can leave the

[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:32.040]
binoculars home the difference there between the last time I was about two months ago and to be

[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.440]
honest with you I pretended to get excited but it looked like it did the first time I was there

[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.520]
back in February it looked ahead a long way to go now it is basically finito it's basically done

[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.860]
and it is spectacular so everybody is going to be there trust me the hockey team itself we've got

[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:52.460]
a ways to go long ways to go but the arena itself and the food stands in the selection of food the

[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.880]
food they tell me is magnificent because they were having a free buffet yesterday what do you think

[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.460]
Rimmer was doing it stuck it up the free buffet ten minutes after ten and we have a whole bunch

[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.920]
of videos to get away to it by the way of the adult variety where the hell did they come from

[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.420]
another box shows up here this is great we don't have to give anybody a plug it just comes in an

[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:15.840]
unmarked box and there's nothing like an unmarked box ten after ten at five sixty wqm if you're

[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:21.740]
feeling lucky speak them q a tail what's a phone on with Dayton Brewer while spending the remainder

[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:53.180]
explain to me okay why is it that anybody of any variety wants to see he she's I mean is that is the

[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:58.100]
is the suggestion that a he she is something for everybody is that he idea these transactuals

[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:03.200]
have got like women with you know is that what what it is chicks with

[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.940]
what what's exciting about that what does it turn on about but hey far be it for me to ask because

[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.360]
believe me no matter what we got we'll find takers out there in radio land and I certainly don't

[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:20.620]
want to be holding these up because poor fat Joe what little bit can't we be adults about this

[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:26.060]
I mean this one is called yum yum baby we have rhymes with yum so what's wrong with that

[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.440]
huh as in dumb which is what those people if you want to get some numbers over there you would have

[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.540]
this on the air tonight I'm serious you put this on a mini of not sure it's that having me talking

[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.260]
about stuff that happened three days before you know I'm watching the 930 show last night I don't

[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.920]
want to get started on the way me stuff but you talk about dumb and it makes me look dumb makes me

[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.320]
look like a fool because I'm sitting there talking about the home run chase and the choir even

[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.140]
know he's a great home run hitter and he's great for the gate he's a basically a boring guy but

[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:57.760]
and he is what the fact is that this is like a Monday show and now in the meantime Tuesday and Wednesday

[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.400]
he's hit the full home runs they have the 45,000 people out there and Wednesday the whole town is

[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.500]
like up in arms and all psychotic about this well supposedly anyway although there's no evidence

[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:12.120]
on this station of it not from our callers not from any of the callers here we just finished with

[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:17.960]
this big Mac attack in town and what are they talking about on a morning show fishing there you go

[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.520]
oh fishing tight lines and good fishing the people's on there are not going to try to

[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:27.260]
wondering how come the show is not always fishing there you go that's something we get saying we

[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:32.460]
can sink our teeth and do how we can get our sinkers out into we can probably drive that morning

[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.400]
never down to about a point three if they keep doing that fishing stuff let's get salty soft

[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:42.240]
fleshman back on the ears what I say for the guy then fishing to me for it if there's anything

[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:52.980]
more boring than golf thank you so much David he really is in his own bizarre way bizarre

[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.620]
but anyway and here's my check from Miami that's good I think I can get out of here now

[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.540]
there's anything more boring than golf it's got to be fishing in fact people who play golf and

[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.180]
go fishing I mean I'm not not kidding if you try going out there and you know dropping your

[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:11.920]
dropping your line or your pull or whatever you're doing trailing with the pull do my guess

[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.240]
but talking about there there are many things in life that are entertaining and enjoyable but nobody

[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.540]
wants to you're talking about like I was saying the other day you can punch your brains out it's

[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:26.320]
your money gamble your life away gamble the mortgage away gamble away the lunch money I don't

[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.580]
care it's a free country to a point do what do you want to do I just don't want to hear about it

[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:37.040]
it is terminal and the one thing I did see on there last night which is absolutely correct

[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.700]
is that if I brought in the program from Pompato Park every Thursday morning it started going down

[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.800]
race by race well I bet on the three buddy broken the four had nested in the

[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.340]
yeah we wouldn't have we wouldn't have anybody listening nobody even I wouldn't listen to it

[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:56.120]
is how god damn boring it would be but fishing I mean let's get sick fishing

[00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.520]
so one of the names of some of these videos that we might give out today because it's the

[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.680]
beginning of a Labor Day holiday weekend and we want you to work on it real hard how what's wrong

[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.300]
with that it's Labor Day what the hell is Labor Day anymore we're supposed to honor the hard

[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:13.980]
working workers of mergers that would labor a is all about do we have any left any hard workers no

[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:20.220]
hardcore he-sheets maybe somebody can tell me what's exciting and turn on about he-sheets in fact

[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.220]
it'll be interesting to see if anybody takes that one if anybody grabs it and the video too

[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.360]
here's suckers too and I know first words not what you think it is but it does begin with a

[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:35.720]
let's give him little hints okay rhymes with dumb oh by the way I should be holding these up because

[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.200]
I want to make sure they all get up what what why are you waving me why are you flipping me off

[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.740]
in here okay you want me to tell me that you brought a bomb in this morning too huh that'll be

[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:50.840]
next scammer fat Joe brought a bomb in this morning or was it something that rhymes with bomb see he

[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.560]
can bring in the bomb but some are rhymes with bomb we can't show on here this one's called anal

[00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:01.280]
trainer what's wrong with that some people are horse trainers some people are anal trainers some

[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:07.060]
people are anal retinue like yelda here's a good example for it here's one called the godmother

[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.700]
part two perfect for this show we've been godfather fans now you can show that catch is she's got

[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:17.320]
her hand come on there you go even fact Joseph we can put that on whammy she's got her hands over

[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:22.300]
okay they're very big and they're very gigantic and she's a slightly dark all kind of like

[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:27.540]
mocha not real dark the godmother part two it says making you an offer you can't refuse

[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:35.100]
boy this is great getting all these every week and a plane unmarked box and then of course we

[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.100]
also got the betzy the sheep or whatever her name is over here for friends and lutes and four

[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:44.740]
mires maybe the beeswigs would like to meet betzy they're here oh they already have

[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:51.240]

[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:57.680]
this is called anal company and anal I'm not too sure about this jazz well it looks like jazz

[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.620]
only one latest bit one later has been changed to uh or it's got to take the innocent

[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.180]
well there's no such really word as that as it is anyway so we can say that on here but no such word

[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:14.860]
plaster by face with rhymes with dumb uh and that you know I gotta be honest with you okay I've

[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.480]
seen everything but that's the cover that is so we're gonna have that on maybe night right come on

[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:25.880]

[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:46.020]
discussed in cover I mean really gruesome and grotesque these are these are probably the most

[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:50.900]
whoever sent us these must have been in a really erotic mood at the time that it did it here's

[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:57.240]
wide bust here's five get that get a good shot of that come on Joe it's just probably a snack time

of course for Joe it's always snack time call her me white there you go kind of lighten up your

[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:11.040]
compression a little bit and what be the other one uh young and fresh oh and this this is the

[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:18.100]
definitive one for our audience here you go my first anal and of course this is like one of those

[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.340]
cartoon like I was saying the other day that people don't say certain things that only like

[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:31.260]
boohoo and this is e-yow is what it is my first anal e-yow as in oh right whoa don't do it again or

[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:36.460]
maybe do it again whatever no thank you so there you go we got a whole bunch of crap to give away

[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.500]
an honor of labor day today for our finalisting audience out there and I guarantee I promise

[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.800]
oh geez since Barry Diller owns that damn thing that whammy thing I wouldn't be surprised if we

[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.200]
have these on a year on that show in spite of what fat Joe was saying that pushing the other room okay

[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.140]
take a look at the size of those have anybody in the world believe that those are for real can any

[00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.000]
now that's gonna be out because they're not for real no seriously wouldn't that be a good

[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.320]
barometer if they're not real flesh they can't be sexual and the commission can't get all that

[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.600]
out of shape about because they're definitely not for real although I wonder if these are for real

[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:14.160]
well anyway we'll find out we have an open line of day one and proud our whole question today is

[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:19.520]
they're a bigger Yahoo in the history of the human race than Terry Bowden no did we ever get the game

[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:26.500]
on my side by the way we did not yeah I'm I get in the car to go to the store to go to public

[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:31.640]
for like a couple of quick things and it's look at the clock it's a quarter day and here I am

[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.380]
yesterday promoting 715 we got Virginia Auburn which nobody cares because it was on TV anyway

[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:45.900]
what Joe no further I know something yeah I am apparently there was a problem with a transmitter

[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:53.000]
or receiver rather we don't have it oh no but we had ESPN radio almost into those high

[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.600]
in his life and I never get any ESPN radio what I'm going to store and I'm thinking how come

[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.280]
to damn game is it not how come to God damn football game is none that we've been promoting all

[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:07.520]
because somebody screwed up real bad really really pull it out just can't do these basic

[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.420]
elementary things so get back home and I actually did turn it on because there was little baseball

[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.800]
online last night and there's nothing else to watch on that damn thing and so I turned that

[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.960]
ball game on you talk see those people think that football so exciting here's another example if

[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.160]
there's I have no idea what the final score was I don't want to know the final score that was a

[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.200]
snoozer in fact maybe even the ESPN radio was more exciting than if you had listened to Virginia

[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:36.020]
Auburn two teams that have no offense none but the one thing that I love watching this and Terry

[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:41.920]
Bowden who is the son of God of course Bobby Bowden from FSU sorry all you seminal fan Bobby

[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:47.980]
Bowden good old boy good old boy and ever still afraid train Terry Bowden is if he isn't from

[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:54.460]
entry if he isn't if he didn't like float up the Kahulawasi River in his youth I mean this man

[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:59.660]
I have never seen such a if you look up the word mugwump in the dictionary there is Terry Bowden

[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:05.120]
you know just one finger in his nose and one in his recto I mean this guy's unbelievable a real

[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:10.840]
Yahoo if you look up Yahoo on your website there's Terry Bowden's thing pops up in his picture too

[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.880]
so that's our poll question is there a bigger a more definitive Yahoo in the world we said maybe

[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:21.680]
one of the beastlies then uh Terry Bowden good God almighty yeah you're all hot gonna

[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.060]
chill football you ready for the excitement of football I got this worth that was the

[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:29.360]
excitement of God damn football if I never see a pig skin again it'll be too soon that was coma

[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:37.000]
inducing 1026 at 560 WQM why not wake up with some great lunch today to your 560 QA

[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.420]
yeah 1030 and QM you just told me something that caused me to just change my whole approach to life

[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:48.640]
that is so grotesque we're getting calls from people I keep in mind yesterday since it I mean

[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.620]
it's the holiday weekend okay after we get to Monday maybe hopefully then it'll be like life

[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:58.460]
back to usual in the sky for a second place maybe everybody on the station everybody in town is

[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:03.480]
praying but in the meantime so yesterday we gave away eight parochic it's the CD almond brothers

[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.540]

[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:23.140]
they're milleted little spikies there's whatever but the fact is that when it comes to getting stuff

[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:27.500]

[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.740]
actually show up or not huh do you think that any one of these would show up at your house no

[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.360]

[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.440]
this hardcore he-sheets I'm sorry but I think you're right this one this this one thing that's

[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.160]

[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:13.420]
that is that is do I dare say this well I mean why not but it doesn't look you said

[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.560]
George said it looks like it's like tied on or paste their glued on or something

[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.920]
it looks like it's coming through from the inside you know what I'm saying

[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:30.100]
like maybe somebody got lost in there and it's coming through from the inside

[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.160]
oh you'd have to see it come on we got to get it on the year on the TV show

[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:44.180]

[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.660]
not just gonna give these uh first of all you got to be over 50 to get these all right if you're

[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.260]
under the age of a hundred there's no chance because we want to make damn sure we don't send these

[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.700]
out to no minors okay of course the kids are all in school anyway that's why we waited

[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.820]
that's why we waited till the kids all went back to school because we don't want no little 16 and

This is what America's all about.

[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.800]
Repressed and constipated that we have to put masking tape over these boxes.

[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.240]
These are even like living and breathing.

[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.260]
These are just pictures as all they are.

[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:39.380]
And catchers.

[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.820]
Oh, they're just pictures on boxes.

[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.240]
OK, with video tapes inside.

[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.600]
And we've got to cover these up.

[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.160]
And there's going to be like tons and tons of tape on these.

[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.500]

[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.160]
All right.

[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.080]
This is Call Up Very Diller at the USA and blame his ass.

[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:00.380]
What is it?

[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.160]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:02.420]
Hello.

[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.180]
Hello, Neil.

[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:04.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.000]
Are you aware that there's a fishing show on Weekly Air?

[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.680]
No.

[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:09.260]
No.

[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.880]
On Saturday morning, at 8am on 790, there's a port of sports from Fish and Show Live.

[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:15.520]
That's perfect.

[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.300]
Because Rineries and you're talking about fishing and that kind of stuff, so it's perfect

[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.180]
on his station.

[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:21.580]
It allows you with a fish here.

[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:22.980]
You know, it's a lot of water.

[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.220]
Nothing wrong with fishing, but who wants to, what is there to talk about?

[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.860]
Well, especially on a radio show.

[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.040]
I mean, I know there are TV shows on fishing, which to me are boring too.

[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.000]
But nevertheless, at least there's something to see.

[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.840]
You know, when you catch the big one or whatever it is.

[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.420]
But on a radio, what is there?

[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.760]
It's like that cigar show.

[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.520]
So, knowledge from somebody that knows something a little more than you do.

[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:41.200]
Like what?

[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:45.080]
Well, you want to be flipping one of your worms when you're supposed to be twitching his

[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:45.880]
arseboot, you know?

[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.520]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.500]
There's techniques for different areas.

[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:48.880]
I have a lot of that.

[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.200]
We got fresh water and saltwater different areas.

[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.840]
And you also show how to tie your fly.

[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:53.500]
Sure.

[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:54.540]
And your buzzbait?

[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:55.120]
Uh-huh.

[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.940]
And drag your rattleshype.

[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:58.420]
Good point.

[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.020]
And anyway, checking that out tomorrow.

[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:02.480]
Saturday.

[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:03.320]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:04.500]
Saturday morning, I hear more.

[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:04.940]
Is it tomorrow or Saturday?

[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:05.740]
Last time I checked?

[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.500]
Anyway, speaking of fish, and that kind of smell and stuff.

[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:08.740]
Yeah.

[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.820]
Can I stuck around for a video?

[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:10.240]
Yeah.

[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.480]
Anyone in particular, sir?

[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.500]
Something very head-row.

[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.360]
So, they're all very head-row, sir.

[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.220]
Believe me what I tell you.

[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.120]
How about anal trainer?

[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:16.980]
Negative.

[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.340]
It's got, but it's got, okay.

[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.960]
How about, uh, you're like this one, believe me?

[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:22.640]
I can't tell you the name.

[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.020]
Hold on.

[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:23.600]
Okay.

[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.320]
Give him this one.

[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.800]
It's called junkies.

[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.080]
What are you doing in the black sheep?

[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.680]
Oh, George is always putting it on the wall.

[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:29.220]
He's mounting it.

[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.080]
I mean, on the wall.

[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:33.580]
Oh, my God.

[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.320]
You better get this.

[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.740]
Yo, George is mounting Betsy.

[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.320]
What did you do with it?

[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:39.120]
Oh, that's bad.

[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.800]
Why didn't you take her off of here now?

[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.800]
Was it interfering with a, see this whammy thing, man?

[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.820]
Our whole life is surrounded.

[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.900]
Well, there were like six people watching their thing.

[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.620]
Now, actually, everywhere I go, this is the amazing part of it.

[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.620]
I know you don't believe me.

[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.980]
Everywhere I go, everybody, in fact, I was in public last night for 15 minutes.

[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.620]
There were 7,000 people lined up.

[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.820]
They're all claimed to watch in the show.

[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.180]
So, you've got damn Nielsen people.

[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.400]
We know it's a communist conspiracy.

[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:03.480]
We know you're paid off.

[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.300]
We know that Wayne probably got his fine thing, right?

[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.680]
Too bad he found his record.

[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.200]
And that's here in the arena the other day.

[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:08.940]
Nice going, Wayne.

[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:11.080]
Where we going?

[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:11.900]
North Miami Beach.

[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:12.300]
Hello.

[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.540]
North Miami Beach.

[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.040]
A year.

[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:17.580]
Yes.

[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.900]
Are you starting Wayne, sir?

[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.420]
I'm trying to finger it out.

[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:27.100]
But I'm only in a train to Darlington, as we're getting to see Jeff Gordon and his

[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.180]
last car, Betty.

[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:28.720]
Yeah.

[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.500]
So, I thought you might bump buddies, yeah?

[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.280]
Yeah, well, it's time that the first ring don't have a clue about hockey.

[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.520]
So, I heard you mentioned Popman earlier.

[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.460]
Can you elaborate on that deal earlier?

[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.640]
And can I scratch up for an anal video?

[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:42.960]
Can I elaborate on the deal?

[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.020]
I mean, there is no deal.

[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.960]
They thought they had the deal done, which is not the first time they thought they had

[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.460]
a deal done.

[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.440]
And all of a sudden, guess what?

[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.080]
It wasn't done.

[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.660]
And then all of a sudden, Mike Smith and the people in Toronto say, well, you know,

[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:57.380]
can we have him come up here and have our own doctors examine him and Yada Yid, all

[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:57.960]
of a sudden, crap.

[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.060]
And they said, no way, because it opens up too many allupals, and we're not going to

[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:02.380]
do that.

[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.020]
And so they said, well, sorry, we don't want to do it.

[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.900]
Maybe we should trade the East Potman for a bit.

[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.280]
Yeah, sounds good to me.

[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.500]
Oh, I thought I fucked up.

[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.200]
What do you want to tell?

[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:10.640]
What do you want?

[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.520]
Just spit it out.

[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.440]
You got to shut up and aim it.

[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.120]
Okay, you got to hold on.

[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.500]
He's sucking up for an anal trainer.

[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:20.100]
Okay.

[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.320]
Yeah, these are going to go fast because we've got to give these all way by noon.

[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.820]
Oh, beautiful job.

[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:25.620]
That's lovely.

[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.180]
Are you sure this is going to peel right off?

[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:28.920]
Now what is that?

[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.040]
In other words, you can put that.

[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:30.660]
That's okay.

[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.180]
On a TV thing, by sure we had the radio people.

[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:34.780]
That's okay.

[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:35.760]
Even Pat Joseph's.

[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.280]
Yeah, that's okay.

[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.700]
Because these aren't for real anyway.

[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.140]
She's got the Zoom.

[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.160]
There's the size of the state of West Virginia.

[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.100]
And the same.

[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.320]
You can't show the nipple.

[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:45.900]
Isn't that.

[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.540]
You can't show the nipple.

[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.460]
Isn't that pathetic?

[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.960]
How you hit that Joe's fat and make an ass on there a few weeks ago.

[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.920]
That was okay.

[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.880]
If there's anything more pornographic than fat Joe's naked ass, I've never seen it in

[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.220]
my life and thank God for that.

[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.260]
But a little nipple, everybody's got a nipple.

[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.660]
How come you shouldn't even your auntens we got nipples?

[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:09.300]
Yes, we we sure do.

[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.240]
We got guys nipples.

[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.980]
Oh, that's different.

[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.460]
So in other words, now you tell me that there's a difference between a guy's nipple.

[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:19.360]
Oh, here's a great topic for you Monday, George, which you also know nothing about.

[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:24.320]
There's a difference between a guy's nipple and a woman's nipple.

[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.600]
Well, this is really very interesting.

[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:31.240]
And of course all these very, very terminally straight guys are going to say, well, a woman's

[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.860]
nipple is an erotic, it's an erogenous zone.

[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.100]
Yeah.

[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.400]
Like yours isn't.

[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.240]
A man's nipple is gross.

[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.960]
A woman is the thing of beauty.

[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:40.900]
That's the difference.

[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.100]
A man's nipple is gross and hairy.

[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.180]
No, no, it's not.

[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.440]
No, it is not.

[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:46.900]
No, it is not.

[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:47.800]
No, it is not.

[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.140]
Absolutely incorrect.

[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:54.040]
Again, another example of you showing your ass to the world, what little you know about

[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:54.620]
anything.

[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.580]
Mr. Sex expert in there will share all of his brilliance with you on Monday from 10 to

[00:39:59.580 --> 00:39:59.780]
10.

[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:00.280]
5.

[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.920]
And then we'll find something else to talk about that he might know something about.

[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.380]
Yeah, men's nipples are hairy.

[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.200]
How about that?

[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:09.440]
Wrong.

[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.380]
And this guy, no, my nipples are not hairy.

[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.720]
And I'm not showing no nipple.

[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.720]
Let me just say, oh yeah, they may be.

[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:16.800]
Well, I hear he holds you.

[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:17.620]
What do you want for me?

[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.880]
But no, let me ask you.

[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:20.560]
You've seen tens.

[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.940]
Would you say that DT's nipples are hairy?

[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:23.720]
No, no.

[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.240]
Of course, it's hard to tell because when you stand sideways.

[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.200]
What?

[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.160]
Don't tell it to you.

[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.040]
I don't know.

[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:29.600]
I'm not talking.

[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.540]
I don't want nothing to do with guys who shave.

[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.760]
Okay, their body here.

[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:33.740]
Oh, geez.

[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:34.480]
That is the most.

[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.800]
Only only screaming queens do that anyway.

[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.200]
Okay?

[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:38.880]
Only flamers do that.

[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.840]
I'll leave the flamers for somebody else.

[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:42.880]
For my Josh Freeman.

[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.080]
Well, he wants a straight video.

[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:45.600]
Well, maybe he wants to learn something.

[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.120]
But isn't that something this business about?

[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:51.200]
And that we're sure we can show these big, big wisdom.

[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.540]
This is long, we don't show the nipples on here.

[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.460]
Isn't that wonderful?

[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.360]
You people up there at the FUCC, man.

[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:00.380]
You people need some very, very serious assistance, okay?

[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:05.580]
And we can certainly show Godmother because she, like I said, oh, oh, geez.

[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.600]
Send the ones away, okay?

[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.740]
They just brought my luncheon at a fat show, just showed the nipple.

[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:17.920]
He just pulled up a certain show, big nipple, with disgusting, oozing fat and cellulite all

[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.380]
around it.

[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.740]
Oh, don't do it again.

[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.020]
I'm going to tell you I'm going to vomit.

[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:22.880]
I'm going to lie off.

[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.020]
Oh, geez.

[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:25.540]
Jesus.

[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.540]
Man, oh man.

[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.500]
And you know, that girlfriend is.

[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.480]
This seems very nice, a little pudgy, but very nice.

[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.200]
Is she like blind?

[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.400]
Is she like, got some kind of a problem between her ears or something?

[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.760]
I mean, how and God's thing could anything alive touch that?

[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.640]
How could anything come close to that?

[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.960]
Like even being in the same vicinity with no clothe without lots of clothing on.

[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.580]
Oh, they do what clothing are, well, I feel better.

[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:52.880]
God, here's Miami.

[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:53.260]
Hello.

[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:55.980]
No, great.

[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:56.560]
Thank you, Frank.

[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.300]
He's back again.

[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:57.780]
Nice going.

[00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:58.840]
Who that sounds like?

[00:41:58.940 --> 00:41:59.620]
That sounds like Ron.

[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:01.580]
We have an open line.

[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:01.980]
It does.

[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:03.840]
How about some pros, that Ron?

[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:04.280]
Come on.

[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.080]
Oh, come on.

[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:05.920]
Let me give it to him.

[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:06.100]
No.

[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:07.420]
Open line.

[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:07.700]
Indeed.

[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.220]
5.6705.60.

[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.880]
5.560 on the 18p wireless line.

[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:12.740]
Come on.

[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.240]
Send us a more pros, that can email, Ron, he doing any good for you.

[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.400]
Here's Bokeh.

[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:17.400]

[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:18.500]
Hello, Neil.

[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:18.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:21.340]
You want to look on the internet.

[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:22.560]
New York Daily News.

[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.560]
They have an article about an old time caller.

[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.580]
You're Jackie Lee.

[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:26.620]
Yeah.

[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.300]
Who's trial is thought and Tuesday?

[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:29.100]
For what?

[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:35.580]
Or a spending pornography, animal park, threatening letters to a trainer that he's had a running

[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.280]
with a three-hole for the last couple of years.

[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:37.640]
Really?

[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.920]
Yeah, he was a Bill Finley's column in the Daily News today.

[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.280]
Well, I sure wish somebody would fix me that if they got it.

[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.300]
I can't pull it up for you, but it was read to me.

[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.920]
I mean, he did George Anthony with the long-time trainer up there.

[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:49.140]

[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.700]
I guess Jackie Lee was a business partner with his for a couple of years, and then they got

[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:56.960]
a run and then they caught him spending pornography for the mail.

[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.380]
Well, sort the stuff.

[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:03.560]
So it looks like Jack has been spending some time with her, they fill it on a richy-woagy

[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:03.720]
column.

[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:04.200]
Really?

[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:04.800]
Yep.

[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.180]
Clial starts on Tuesday.

[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.340]
Thanks for the good news.

[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:07.840]
They care.

[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:08.260]
Thanks.

[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.560]
I guess we won't be here from Jackie Lee anymore.

[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.260]
Great.

[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.240]
Yeah, he's just one of those guys who just heart-ass.

[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.520]
That's the whole deal with him.

[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.740]
Doesn't surprise me in Leispert.

[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:19.860]
Heart-ass.

[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.620]
Where we going to, what is it?

[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.880]
North, what is, what is that?

[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.340]
M-O-B.

[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:26.900]
What is that?

[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.220]
Michigan owned in bread?

[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:29.600]
Is it like a horse thing?

[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:30.160]
What does that mean?

[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.200]
Michael.

[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:33.740]
It means my horse.

[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:34.100]
I'm aware.

[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.300]
Okay, let's go to somewhere.

[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:35.660]
Hello.

[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:36.540]
Hello?

[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.320]
What a lot of deal.

[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.880]
Well, it says M-O-B.

[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.400]
There's a mob student for a lot of it.

[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.420]
They'll show you fit right in.

[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:44.440]
I just got a postcard in the mail.

[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.320]
I'll show you how part of the Nielsen family.

[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:46.700]
Yeah.

[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:48.440]
What do I do?

[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:49.840]
What do you mean?

[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:50.300]
What do you do?

[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:54.480]
You got to call me in a day and call me what I should, part of the survey.

[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:55.620]
Yeah.

[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.620]
So I get to know what?

[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.440]
That I'm going to be part of the Nielsen family.

[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.740]
So they're going to hook you up with a meter?

[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.340]
They're going to hook me up with a meter?

[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:05.320]
Oh, sure.

[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.300]
If you say yes, if you say you want to be a part of the family, there's

[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.400]
going to come a meter right up to your TV.

[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:11.220]
Oh, why not?

[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:12.360]
Why not?

[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:12.780]
Yeah.

[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.660]
I just like to say a special thanks.

[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.220]
I know what we not Canadians are all a lot.

[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:17.940]
Yes, we do.

[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:21.160]
I just want to say those people from Nova Scotia aren't part of Canada.

[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:22.940]
They get a hell of a job up there.

[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.500]
No, but those are English speaking people.

[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:25.360]
We only knocked the front.

[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:26.280]
OK.

[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:27.820]
Special thanks.

[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.860]
Let's go out to those people.

[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.100]
And then they also say Swiss air deserves a lot of credit, too, for getting right in there

[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.980]
and getting their people right in and notifying the families.

[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.900]
As opposed to TWA and the whole industry out there, they did and jerked everybody around

[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.740]
when they hit that crash.

[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:39.460]
Yeah, I know.

[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:41.060]
I really have thought of them.

[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.140]
I really appreciate it.

[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.420]
I think they did a great job.

[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:44.400]
Yeah, I'm with the airlines.

[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.580]
I really don't think so.

[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:47.160]
OK.

[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:47.880]
I don't know what they are.

[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:48.740]
OK, we'll need your help.

[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:49.800]
Get that meter in there, sir.

[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.040]
OK, I'll get it in.

[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:51.700]
God bless you.

[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:52.080]
Thank you.

[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:52.540]
We love him.

[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:53.780]
How do you like that?

[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:54.940]
Now we got some hope there.

[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.300]
I mean, we got a Neilton guy.

[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:56.820]
I don't know.

[00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:57.700]
That's what we need.

[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.440]
We need to fix it.

[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.600]
I've put it in a long time ago.

[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:00.740]
Need to get those.

[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.900]
I need to find it like I've about 20 sets in the house.

[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.460]
It's a 10.56.

[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:06.600]
A second amount went and down.

[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.160]
I don't want to see any more flesh from in there.

[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.060]
The only flesh is going to be on pictures from in here.

[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.220]
OK, here's one for you.

[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.440]
You can do a job on that one, boy.

[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.340]
That will be a tremendous.

[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:14.160]
Huh?

[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.640]
If you can cover how he's going to have to use a lot of paper

[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.040]
about two rolls on that, baby.

[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.920]
But David seems to be the hands of experience there.

[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:22.780]
He knows where to stick it.

[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:24.340]
It's for you.

[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.380]
You a hell.

[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.900]
The Neil Roger showdown.

[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:28.960]
Yeah, baby.

[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.200]
5.60 WQM hand-gover.

[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:31.860]
We're here with two.

[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:32.760]
We got the Marlins again.

[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:32.880]

[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.460]
And does anybody care about that picture?

[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.200]
Is it in the shows?

[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.120]
Is it in the shows?

[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:37.760]
Does anybody care?

[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.040]
No, I knew you wouldn't.

[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.760]
So anyway, I'm sure I'm interested in finding out about how

[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.800]
come that vulgarment and get on life's life that we promoted.

[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.320]
The hell out of all day long, we had those promos running on tape.

[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.340]
We're promoting it live.

[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:48.580]
We got Virginia Auburn.

[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:49.420]
It's your football set.

[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:52.960]
We got ESPN radio on here.

[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.660]
Oh my God.

[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:56.720]
By the way, lunch today.

[00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:57.560]
Everybody get lunch.

[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:00.300]
Not that I read it here because I got mine.

[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:01.400]
I got my cool cuts.

[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:01.960]
Look at his back.

[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:21.760]
I got a little bit of a couple of peppered cheeses.

[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.400]
That's about it.

[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.200]
Thank you guys.

[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:25.980]
Let's do it.

[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:26.840]
What is that again?

[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.140]
The mob in Miami.

[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.060]
Okay, let's go to the mob in Miami.

[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:31.320]
Joseph said he did that.

[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:31.940]
He said, I'm going to go to the mob in Miami.

[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:31.940]

[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:31.940]

[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:31.940]

[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:31.940]

[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:31.940]

[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:31.940]

[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:31.940]

[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:31.940]

[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:31.940]

[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:31.940]

[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.440]
He said, you're the mob in Miami.

[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.640]
Okay, so you better look around to where you are.

[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:38.920]
Mr.

[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:39.740]
He's so right.

[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.440]
He knows you, maybe he's going one of these.

[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:41.960]
I don't know.

[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.140]
Joseph Stella is a part of the mob.

[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.820]
Emil, you're wondering if we can afford to work in this joint.

[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:49.180]
Emil, are you all right?

[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:49.820]
I'm fine.

[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.020]
Why?

[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.640]
Because they come back when you start to venting like that.

[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.840]
I mean, hope for over 20, 30 minutes.

[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:56.800]
Pension about what?

[00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.840]
I turned on the radio like half-hour ago.

[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.160]
And you should know better than to expect more from North

[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:04.860]
from Florida.

[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.600]
I mean, they're an animal that's like a looming object.

[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.400]
You mean the people that are free means who want to know?

[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:10.800]

[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.600]
Yeah, it's a ticket.

[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.500]
I mean, keep in mind, it wasn't even 10, 30 in the morning yet.

[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:19.480]
The next day after we gave them away, and already these people got the hopes of it.

[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.000]
I could understand if the concert was tomorrow night.

[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:22.940]
It's next Wednesday.

[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:23.520]
It's the night.

[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:24.140]
Okay?

[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.680]
They are a big deal here.

[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:26.780]
They're a real ten.

[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:28.100]
They want to express delivery.

[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.060]
They want somebody knocking on their door with it.

[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.560]
And this cheap ass outfit is going to pay to have a career.

[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.600]
They'll deliver something free that you want for nothing.

[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.360]
And I'll bet you they're not even going to call you and thank you.

[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:38.080]
Thank you.

[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.760]
That's close to what I was saying.

[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:40.860]
Look at all the tickets.

[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.260]
I heard somebody call one of the shows and maybe it was Hangshul yesterday.

[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:50.600]
And thank the station for talking about going out into Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and winning tickets.

[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:51.860]
It seemed big, Mac, and that day.

[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.720]
Look at all the tickets that we gave away for the Marlins Cardinal Series.

[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.060]
And have I had anybody call here?

[00:47:58.260 --> 00:47:59.620]
I mean, I think maybe we had one.

[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.880]
But all the other people that we gave away thinking so that it could go out and be a part of history

[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.860]
and be a part of that great stuff that I've enough.

[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.420]
They don't call back and say thank you.

[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:07.160]
They're thankless.

[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.220]
And I think it's the most wonderful, ungrateful free voting package.

[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.080]
It was one more similar.

[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:11.620]
Yeah.

[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:11.840]
Right.

[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:15.840]
And I figure in 20-something years, you can only have 23, 24 years.

[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:16.900]
100 years, right.

[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:17.240]
Right.

[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.260]
I mean, have you ever seen anything different?

[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:19.860]
No.

[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:21.240]
Every year after year.

[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:21.500]
No.

[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:22.880]
But it doesn't have to matter if it gets worse.

[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:23.540]
Right.

[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:24.280]
And the thing you do.

[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.080]
You don't want to know why?

[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:25.620]
Why?

[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.060]
Because it goes with a territory.

[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.360]
Being a free-roader down here is like, it's actually like a form of life.

[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:31.980]
It's like something to do.

[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.180]
Well, that's the thing.

[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:37.640]
You know, your if-floor and the thing is, if you ever let go out of your job or your

[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.200]
lose your house or whatever, board is the place you want to be.

[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.760]
Because you can always live on the street like half the port even still.

[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:49.060]
So, you know, I mean, this is a place where you're going to have a lot of shluckers and a lot of fuckers.

[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.800]
And thinking of fucking around.

[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.580]
Yeah, what do you want?

[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:54.540]
What do you want?

[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.840]
Which one sounded in preview?

[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:56.760]
Anyone in particular?

[00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.760]
I like, I like, I like, I like, I don't even like that.

[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.460]
You have anything like that?

[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.760]
I don't even have anything like that.

[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:02.840]
I don't even have anything like that.

[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.320]
I don't even have anything like that.

[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:03.480]
I don't even have anything like that.

[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:03.680]

[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:04.820]
I don't even have anything like that.

[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:06.660]
You want anything like that?

[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:07.660]
I don't even have anything like that.

[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:10.240]
Well, here's one that's got to have a lesbian team in it.

[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:14.720]
But this is a cute young babe, Eager, my first anal EO, young and fresh.

[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.400]
Yeah, this is got all kind of, this has got some that you can't even figure out what they are yet.

[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:19.000]
Okay.

[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.100]
Okay, hang on pal.

[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:20.660]
That's right.

[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:20.980]
That's right.

[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.800]
Okay, he's on the sixth, he's on the mob line.

[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.940]
Jokas does take care of the mob lines.

[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:31.220]
Here's our gold steam in here today, which we had a microphone so after talk, but we don't.

[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.260]
Can you believe what kind of a radio thing they're going to do?

[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:37.020]
Just thing by the way, because the TV people are figuring out what you are.

[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.240]
I am so worried about you.

[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:46.980]
Every time I see you get bigger and bigger, there are states in the United States that are on this big, is our gold thing.

[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.720]
What does it say on the end?

[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:56.700]
It says, Al Goldstein, how homosexuals can open doors, probably from the rear as in breakfast, what he's talking about.

[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.780]
So, see, you're way behind the times, you're supposed to be like George.

[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:05.200]
You think you're a sex expert, and the meantime we found out that more heterosexuals are in anal sex than homosexuals.

[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.080]
So, of course to show you, you know, little.

[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.560]
Oh, here he is with my keys again.

[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:09.820]
Now, look at that.

[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.480]
It's got like a little pink bow on it too.

[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.820]
Don't hit this camera. I'm telling you, those whammy people, you'll be the whammy.

[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:18.340]
Yeah.

[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:28.180]
The ultimate guide to anal sex for women by, what is this from the Clinton family? Who's this from?

[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:32.300]
What are you showing me here by Tristan Taramino?

[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.680]
Oh, to read and learn. I don't mind interested in anal sex. That's up your rally, okay?

[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:41.220]
Please, be my guest. You can probably take a big, be sure and get him, okay?

[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.740]
Because he's a big hambo. He wants to be on air.

[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:49.420]
You know something, if the whammy people were smart, which they're not, but if they were smart, they'd hit his ass on here.

[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:52.260]
He's got more money than God. He'd go on air for free.

[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.400]
He'd go, he'd pay you people. He's got such a massive ego.

[00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:00.640]
This man is the only guy in the world that's got a body of the size of Montana and the ego that's still bigger than that.

[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.560]
Get out, I'll please.

[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:07.180]
It wasn't bad enough I had to have what's his name in here hugging me, the Don Cox.

[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:11.220]
Now I got out goldstein touching me in the middle of my lungs.

[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.200]
Look at that, look at that.

[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:15.020]
Get out of here.

[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.360]
And you know, it's the sad part of it is he's serious.

[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:21.660]
The first human contact he said in months.

[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:24.740]
Oh, that's good. I'm glad it was good for you.

[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.240]
Okay, it's all over.

[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.100]
Here you go. Here you go. Here's the towel. Go have a good time.

[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.640]
Oh my God.

[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.280]
Okay, now let me ask you before you leave.

[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:39.640]
Enjoy the place. This is like a joke. It's like a standing joke.

[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:43.080]
The tape says the anchor. Yeah, the anchor. I know all about the anchor.

[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:44.240]
What is your scrolling?

[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:49.880]
You're going to hit this microphone. He's like Don Concier the other day.

[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.160]
Can you control it? How can I ask you how do you breathe seriously?

[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:59.240]
No, no, no, seriously. How do you breathe? Your face is all red.

[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.180]
You're like all you did was bend down and hug the chair for like 10 seconds.

[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.080]
And you stood here and like your face is all flush.

[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.880]
You look like you're ready for a heart attack.

[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.200]
What sizes those two shirts you have that you're wearing sewn together?

[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:12.540]
Jesus.

[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:19.860]
He's wearing a bag pack, a fanny pack, the size of Vermont.

[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:22.640]
Yeah, but somewhere in there.

[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.360]
Okay, thanks, Al. Stay good and you're in twisted.

[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:26.680]
Look at how it's that.

[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.400]
What up? She pizza dredged. Sit and only was Jewish.

[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:34.500]
Look at that. My little thing just fell on.

[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.300]
Okay, there's Al Goldstein yesterday with Don Concier two days ago disrupting the show.

[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.660]
Today we got Al Goldstein.

[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.720]
Just unbelievable. It's like a circus. It's like a zoo in here.

[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.900]
Are we doing a show anymore? No. Not this week. It's Labor Day. It's a holiday.

[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:47.280]
Relax.

[00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:52.140]
But David is still prant. We over here taping up the private toe.

[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.580]
Here you go. Now here you go, Joe.

[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:59.200]
We can get this on there. Yeah, we got like little or piece of tape on this.

[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:02.780]
Because we got to satisfy the FUCC and Washington DC.

[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.680]
We don't want to put no dirty body parts on the television.

[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.000]
Especially on Wami because there's getting them tonight.

[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:11.920]
Already that's the last goddamn thing we need is a bunch of pornography on it.

[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:16.800]
Because some little tiny kids out there might want to watch it and see that there's such a thing as a human body part.

[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:17.680]
God forbid.

[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.420]
It's 11 a.m. away to take you.

[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:22.940]
I'm sick.

[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:28.580]
W2M. I don't have a guest mic in this cheap past outfit.

[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.300]
So we could have put out on the air for a couple of minutes.

[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.580]
And he was busy wrestling with a thing down around the floor.

[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.280]
We have to be the sheep. We do.

[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:35.580]
Yeah. It's going to come to the cabin.

[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:37.320]
It's going to come to the cabin behind us there. The guest mic.

[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:38.120]
Nice going, guys.

[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.540]
Easily meaning for you.

[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:41.360]
We're going to build your state of the art studio.

[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.740]
We're going to spare an hour expense. We want the new RGA, your full of craft.

[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.720]
Okay. Red, go get your just bonus. Good out of here.

[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:52.140]
So anyway, there's this one David Suarez who worked feverishly in here to put them asking tape.

[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.700]
So we can make these suitable for TV on the whammy show.

[00:53:55.660 --> 00:54:00.080]
And did a bird. Look at that. Beautiful job covering all the right spots and holes and parts.

[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:05.020]
And just to make sure that we don't displease our friends up there in Washington DC and give them upset and men out of shape.

[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.320]
But on this one, I would have to question.

[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.320]
I mean, he blocked out the body part.

[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:12.980]
But what said on that very attractive young lady's post? A face. What is that?

[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:20.000]
And of course, I figured out it's where she's probably. How she knows she's exactly what is it's your conclusion?

[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:22.240]
And that was that. That's what he's done.

[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.180]
Oh, why is Joe walking around with the vast lane in the sand?

[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:31.100]
Oh, he must have seen a sheep in here today. Nice going. Joe, he must be psychic. He must be talking to show Griffin.

[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:33.920]
I heard the shows were coming in for the games this weekend.

[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:36.700]
Where we going to for a lot of day. Hello?

[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.880]
Hey, yes, sir. What's up, Leo?

[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:44.080]
Hey, don't. Hey, pretty good. Hey, Leo, my lady just broke up with her girlfriend.

[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.040]
And I could go for an anal trinninger.

[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.440]
You and your old lady broke up with her girlfriend?

[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.180]
Yeah, but our girlfriend. Yeah.

[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:53.920]
What does that mean?

[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:57.740]
That means, we're not a welcome in the house anymore.

[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.420]
You're a slow skin a little too much. You know what I mean?

[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:03.320]
Yeah, and I'm probably swimming a little bit too.

[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:03.740]
I'm so.

[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:05.680]
Dude, it's good.

[00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:06.880]
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:09.560]
Well, I tell you that we're talking about fishing on a morning show this morning.

[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.040]
I guess it kind of slits a soft over.

[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:15.100]
Yeah, that's with my Zara spooker or whatever that character was talking about.

[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:15.800]
That old red net.

[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:16.740]
You think I'm a guy?

[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.200]
Zara spook, yeah.

[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:19.560]
Oh, yeah. That's what you're going to be.

[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:22.100]
Okay, hang on, pal. Give him this one. It sounds like you're like that.

[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:23.300]
Yeah. A lot of it.

[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.460]
Hey, listen, you'll get whatever I give you. Okay? And you'll like it too.

[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.040]
And then you can call up your down one day. He said,

[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.580]
How come you sent me that piece of crap?

[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.160]
But when you thought we were getting okay, you'll think whatever we give you.

[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:35.080]
I sure wish I knew where these came from, boy.

[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:37.180]
Look at that. They're only like 999 of these.

[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.720]
Dude, they got the stickers on it with the prizes.

[00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:41.100]
Pretty damn cheap, if you ask me, a hell of a bargain.

[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:46.360]
But we just get a plain ground box every week and they can send you these to us.

[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:49.520]
And we're delighted to provide the public with a little bit of entertainment and amusement out there.

[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.020]
And this otherwise extraordinarily dull and boring place.

[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:54.300]
I mean, is it any context?

[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:57.780]
Are they more excited and worked up about these than they were than Mark McGuire?

[00:55:57.940 --> 00:55:58.780]
You bet you're sweet.

[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.380]
That they don't give a crap about the big Mac.

[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:02.240]
How's that Mac Arena coming by the way?

[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.180]
I love that. I think that was one of my strobe subgenius, the Mac Arena.

[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:10.580]
And after Big Mac, here's Kendall. Hello.

[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:12.240]
Hey, welcome, young.

[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:12.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.380]
No, that's the first humanist's wife.

[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:18.100]
I didn't know if you made any comments about Senator Lieberman and Mary.

[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:19.440]
We also were talking about yesterday.

[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.500]
No, I did not. I saw Senator Lieberman live as a matter of fact.

[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.940]
I was sitting on the channels and there he was.

[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.760]
And I thought, what an asshole is what I thought.

[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:26.460]
I like it too.

[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:28.400]
Whoa, you know, but...

[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:28.680]
But what?

[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:31.540]
I'm in...

[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:32.700]
What's the...

[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.440]
Terry and the other guy, the cleaning, the chaps of New York,

[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:37.500]
that we need to get everything better, better...

[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:38.020]
Fun him.

[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.260]
Yeah, so we don't have to be wanting him in.

[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.240]
Let me get up to two.

[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:42.680]
Something with...

[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:44.900]
That's over for 20, though.

[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:45.300]
Yeah.

[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:46.200]
So that's the...

[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:47.620]
That's in...

[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:47.920]
It's over.

[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:49.420]
But let me ask you this.

[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:50.240]
How come...

[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.280]
How come they don't wait?

[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:53.900]
I mean, in the one hand, you say, well, we don't want to act prematurely.

[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:57.600]
And we have to wait till they send up the report and then the White House responds with...

[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:59.480]
So why didn't they just shut up until they get the report?

[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:01.780]
Why did he feel compelled to be standing there for...

[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:01.920]
Wow.

[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.260]
Constraving for the TV audience, and he's standing in the empty chamber.

[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.260]
Why did he feel compelled to do that?

[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:08.500]
Unless he's covering his own hands.

[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.080]
So we're understanding that for those watching...

[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.660]
I can't stand getting to where I was watching MSNBCL.

[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:14.260]
Oh, God.

[00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:18.260]
But you were talking to somebody that went to find the dying friends.

[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:18.900]
Uh-huh.

[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:23.120]
And they said they had to do everything they wanted to restrain her from getting on the phone.

[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:26.840]
How in the middle of the program they had to pay and throw in the reason.

[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:27.460]
Yeah.

[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:29.620]
So they put the... they put the credit card in.

[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.320]
And they were shooting your wife around over and over again.

[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:33.360]
And then they were like, well, I'm sorry. Like about 10 months later.

[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.300]
It just doesn't have the desired impact, I don't think.

[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:36.920]
It's too late.

[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:37.520]
It's probably...

[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.440]
It's probably too late.

[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:38.980]
There you go.

[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:39.500]
Okay, okay.

[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:39.720]
I'll go there.

[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:40.440]
I'll go there.

[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:40.620]
I'll go there.

[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:41.060]
I'll go there.

[00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:41.880]
You should have video.

[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:43.160]
For which one?

[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:44.440]
For anything with any children.

[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:46.800]
Who'd you... how about the Godmother Part 2?

[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:47.300]
Sure.

[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:48.060]
Okay.

[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.160]
She's a memorial mother.

[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:49.520]
Okay.

[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:50.260]
Line the one.

[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:50.720]
Give me the guy.

[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.100]
Oh, Joe's right on top of that one.

[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.160]
Yeah, give me the mob mother.

[00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:56.540]
Oh, jeez, the Godfather.

[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:57.900]
Just right on the rectum.

[00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:58.400]
Right on the day.

[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:00.340]
Just like Wayne, if you're reading, I would...

[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:02.480]
I would give an anything you'll be near a Wednesday.

[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:03.840]
Oh, Wayne's here.

[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:04.200]
Look at that.

[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:04.680]
Look down there.

[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.000]
Wayne's gonna check out one of the chairs.

[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:06.840]
Oops, sorry.

[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:08.440]
Sorry.

[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:10.080]
Just fell on his big template rectum.

[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:10.940]
What do you guys...

[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:12.740]
Anne has got his bed of a compression as his pulse.

[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:13.340]
You think so?

[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:14.380]
Wouldn't that be something?

[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:15.320]
Praderass.

[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:18.660]
It's 1119 on 56.

[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:18.960]
Hello.

[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:20.120]
Hello, Neil.

[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:20.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:20.680]

[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:21.560]
Okay.

[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:22.300]
Good.

[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:26.680]
I know you're not so much more than other applied compaques.

[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:28.940]
But, you know, the way you buy that.

[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:32.440]
Well, you probably have to be closer than you probably

[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:33.600]
have to score, too.

[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.240]
And I was just wondering if you heard what's going on

[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:38.080]
with the truck's pre-well.

[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.120]
You know that he has been repiling the suit.

[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:45.080]
Yeah, he has the nerve now to want to sue the NBA for...

[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:45.540]
He's an asshole.

[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:46.060]
He's an asshole.

[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:46.400]
Yeah.

[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:47.320]
He has an apple.

[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:52.540]
I mean, you know, they had about 100 witnesses that

[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:54.380]
saw him, you know, wrapped his hand around.

[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:54.840]
Oh, they have witnesses?

[00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:56.800]
They have it on tape.

[00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:58.200]
Are you kidding me?

[00:58:58.420 --> 00:58:59.340]
I'm pretty sure.

[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.680]
I didn't know that much.

[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:01.040]
Yeah.

[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:02.700]
Well, it's like absolutely ridiculous.

[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:04.760]
I mean, he's claiming that it's racism.

[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:09.240]
And it's absolutely ridiculous because usually the one being the racist.

[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.660]
In fact, I'm almost positive.

[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.700]
I mean, maybe not the whole episode, but I've seen at least parts of that on tape.

[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:15.800]
I'm almost sure I've seen it.

[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:16.500]
Wow.

[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:19.040]
But if the Marvelous had gone like it happened in a...

[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.120]
Sure, they got lots of witnesses.

[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:22.700]
It happened that it's a practice with a bunch of people.

[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:23.420]

[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:24.540]
It's unbelievable.

[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:29.520]
You know, National TV, the approach, Carlos, some or whatever his name is.

[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:29.680]
Right.

[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:31.700]
And then he turns around and he wants to sue the league.

[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:32.700]
He's an asshole.

[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:34.280]
He feels that he's not making enough money.

[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:34.460]
Yeah.

[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:35.820]
Not even playing basketball.

[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:38.600]
Now he's the only one in my life for hockey and not too much more.

[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:39.640]
Because it's all a bunch of crap.

[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:40.880]
It's gotten to be ridiculous.

[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:41.180]
Yeah.

[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:43.060]
And you're overpaid assholes.

[00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:43.720]
What do you want, sir?

[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:44.920]
Can I get on those videos?

[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:45.820]
Okay.

[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:48.880]
Next one on top of the pile, young, young, baby.

[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.420]
Lines with dumb.

[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:50.960]
Hold on.

[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:51.500]
Okay.

[00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:52.860]
Okay.

[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:52.980]

[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.140]
Let's do what these guys got.

[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:54.800]
Why went it down?

[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:57.820]
And of course, maybe we'll let them take PLB of stuff off.

[00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:58.100]
Okay?

[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:58.760]
I don't think so.

[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:01.960]
Maybe David will let the PLB back off after you stuck it on.

[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:05.180]
What does that mean?

[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.520]
What does that mean, Joe?

[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.940]
He keeps putting mob on there.

[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.020]
Mob in some rise.

[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.520]
What does that mean?

[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:13.580]
The mob is all over the goddamn place.

[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.120]
I just don't understand what this is all about.

[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.160]
Joe Costell is in there.

[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:18.840]
What do you mean?

[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:21.360]
Mob or you today is obsessed.

[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:22.840]
I think there's a message in there.

[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.360]
Oh, I know what it is.

[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.280]
I mentioned about fishing shows this morning.

[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:29.480]
And, you know, maybe the colors are going to sleep with the fishes when they're done.

[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:30.380]
Maybe that's what it's about.

[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.340]
Some kind of a sublimal message in here.

[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:33.660]
Maybe we want our way to polymer.

[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:34.720]
We just don't know of you.

[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:37.560]
Here's the mob in sunrise.

[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:37.980]
Hello?

[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.060]
You know, dear.

[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.520]
Sir, are you part of the mob?

[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:41.500]
No, you're right.

[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.000]
Do you like the part of the mob?

[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:44.300]
Well, I guess.

[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:45.840]
Yes, I know.

[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.220]
So, if I do get killed, I guess.

[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:49.740]
You don't.

[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:50.740]
I can't be enjoying one.

[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.120]
I'm not.

[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:51.760]
Some good first.

[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.460]
I was going to comment about like that.

[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.780]
You went to the, uh, the new arena.

[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.780]
Oh, it is beautiful.

[01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.180]
It can be served in there.

[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:05.000]
It's going down, I guess, to, uh, you know, the other day, just part out over there down there.

[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.420]
It's not in the migrator.

[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:11.440]
It would be a, it would be a, uh, comparing a, a folkworm with a gigantic, beautiful,

[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.220]
steak dinner.

[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.520]
I mean, they're, they're, they're no comparison.

[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.980]
Yeah, they're the most beautiful places I've ever seen in your life.

[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:20.200]
They come in right there, and they're, uh, they're just, uh, the stuff that feels moan.

[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:20.320]
Yeah.

[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:25.700]
You know, it's, you know, it's, it's regular, it's good air, it's a fancy camp, it's Miami-Northy.

[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:26.700]
You got it over here, it's not like that.

[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.580]
Well, yeah, because they got the inputs right off the, uh, off the, uh,

[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:30.220]
sawgrasters.

[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.580]
Yeah, it was right right right in off the, uh, there's another one in the house,

[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:36.600]
or inside, but at least you're inside the place, and they've got out in the outer lobby.

[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:40.580]
There are restaurants and, uh, you know, snack bars and, and all kinds of good stuff.

[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:44.460]
And there's going to be a big, um, panther, paraphernalia store, shopping, or device,

[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.780]
and all of that stuff.

[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.380]
It's like a whole different world.

[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.260]
Yes, you could fit the other arena in there, like one third of it.

[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.460]
Yeah, but it's, because I've been by, you know,

[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:56.300]
because I was sort of stating that they have to work around there, and you know,

[01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:00.060]
just, just going to, and the margaritas, it's really like, like, Charlie,

[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.640]
so I started to urinate, you know, that, you know, the water's up there.

[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.280]
Yeah, it was, it was, the pasta place was sterile.

[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.960]
I mean, it was functional, but it really was sterile.

[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.540]
This place is, yeah, it's magnificent.

[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.780]
You're being close to the area, you know, having some little shopper

[01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:15.540]
to the studios will make a little bit of a night versus like, you know, the, uh,

[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:17.120]
being in the middle of the water, so I mean,

[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:22.400]
like, like, face of us, uh, the lobby lady, and you know, that, you know,

[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.080]
kind of, you know, kind of, I don't know where this place is, kind of,

[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.760]
it has a little bit, you know, it's in the first place,

[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.140]
I was being dealt with, I was a man, it's a man, I don't know where,

[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.500]
but like, you know, it's kind of, I was just like, yeah.

[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.060]
So, well, why is it kind of in the kinky side, uh,

[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.300]
do you see the opening of, do you see the other one?

[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.500]
Can I see, do you see something?

[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:37.240]
Yeah, I got it.

[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.840]
Do you see, do you see, like, like, look at different colors?

[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.740]
Oh, this is different, believe me.

[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:44.700]
I see the, you know, these things from my temple, as well,

[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.380]
you know, if you do like, if you do.

[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:47.520]
Okay, you got to hang on, son.

[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:47.960]
Thank you.

[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.400]
Okay, this is the one that's got the person inside of the person or whatever I was in before.

[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:52.760]
I'm telling you, there's somebody in there.

[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.080]
There's somebody knocking on the door and you just can't get out.

[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.160]
Wow.

[01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.460]
Those to show you guys don't go, you know,

[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.360]
exploring too far because you may wipe up inside the cavern

[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.300]
and never be able to find you way back out again.

[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.020]
24 after 11, I'm fighting last night on QA.

[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:10.180]
We better get to the bottom of that.

[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.540]
I think that's a real major,

[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.260]
I wonder who's responsible for that.

[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:15.380]
You don't think you could be blocked, do you?

[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:17.940]
When you think the program director would have been all set up,

[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.300]
we would have that line in and make sure that we got that game

[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.480]
come out simple promoting you will run in almost all day.

[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:26.020]
Here's, uh, Samob and Hollywood, hello.

[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:27.640]
Hello, deal.

[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:28.200]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:29.380]
How are you today?

[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.020]
Okay.

[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.160]
Hey, hey, I was looking to do that picture show this morning.

[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:34.300]
Pretty difficult.

[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.860]
Hey, really, thank you very, very much.

[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:36.500]
Talk about it.

[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:40.200]
I'm just about to have a man with a wire here.

[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.540]
It's just a big, $200.

[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.200]
Mr. Benton, a history man cut.

[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:46.240]
The Dolphin season starts this weekend,

[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.460]
the first meaningful game.

[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:50.160]
The happy camp of the working camp open Saturday.

[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.080]
We got the arena now just about finished.

[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.520]
All of a sudden stuff going on here and they're talking about fishing

[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.640]
and then they wonder how come the show sucks so bad.

[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.100]
That's exactly why.

[01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.940]
What the hell is wrong with these guys?

[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.020]
And then, and then even worse than that,

[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:05.540]
they got Gildey on there doing a suck up to his New York Jets thing,

[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.700]
which everybody here with a brain hates the Jets like poison,

[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.080]
except those New York idiots.

[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.760]
What the hell is that all about?

[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:15.260]
Gildey got such a good chance of regular feature now as part of a Jets 2 now.

[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.080]
Yeah, right.

[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.800]
Yeah, the only reason was because I was waiting for you to come on.

[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.700]
And then he started talking about fishing and the Jets.

[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.160]
And I was like, turning it off.

[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.160]
Oh, that's time to keep them on.

[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:27.860]
Man, I think lawsuit is in order.

[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.440]
Yeah, I agree with you.

[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:30.680]
Hey, can I get one of those videos?

[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:32.860]
That's what we got next.

[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.800]
It's called, uh, faster my face with,

[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:36.700]
come on, pal.

[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:37.640]
That'll work.

[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:38.800]
Okay, yeah, it does.

[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.840]
If you look at the picture,

[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.120]
oh, by the way, spit it in the picture.

[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:43.020]
Boy, there must be a lot of that.

[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.820]
The jerk inflation going around town,

[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:45.540]
these are women are,

[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.140]
you know, you got to look good in the morning.

[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:48.720]
You got to look really beautiful in the morning.

[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.140]
What am I going to do with these, by the way?

[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:52.700]
Where the hell are we?

[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.060]
I'll put it on the black sheep back there.

[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.720]
Yeah, George can get him here and do it up in the mayors

[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.860]
just for the eating of pre-launch.

[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:00.520]
It's 1126 and 560.

[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:03.940]
Q-A-L, you can get my rear end.

[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.900]
It's 1132 and 560,

[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.380]
WQM, happy Friday, too.

[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:10.380]
Maybe they hung on a more celebrated

[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:11.760]
by giving away some great stuff.

[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:12.980]
They just showed up in a box.

[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.440]
That we had the old box in the box.

[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.480]
And what a great job they did for the most part

[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.920]
of taking up these things for the most part.

[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.800]
Only one here on the back, I mean,

[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.860]
it's interesting to me that he takes up certain or a physicist.

[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:28.160]
But other things kind of look like, uh, oh, white.

[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.400]
You don't want to shoot those, Joe.

[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.900]
If you want to value your job.

[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.480]
And anyway, she must have done a bad job of applying the lotion.

[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:36.080]
Look at that.

[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:36.500]
Huh?

[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.780]
Well, well, it looks like some of it's sloped right there.

[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.940]
Anyway, we got the three of these left.

[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.400]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.520]
Oh, the Dow is up 51 cents.

[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.040]
Oh, it has X up 5 points.

[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:46.940]
Maybe we will be.

[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.520]
All these snack bars, all these different kinds of food.

[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.800]
I mean, you know, the old Miami arena, the food there,

[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:54.760]
was like absolutely the worst thing.

[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.180]
Made the food at P.P. Park seem like gourmet.

[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.320]
It was like going to Roots Chris Steakhouse by comparison,

[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:04.020]
the difference between P.P. Park and the Miami arena.

[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:05.820]
They're the worst goddamn food.

[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.140]
But here I have a feeling it's going to be better,

[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:09.280]
and they know it's got to be better,

[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.340]
because if they want to keep us in there and know the quality

[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:12.540]
of the team it's going to be on the ice,

[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.860]
we're going to be spending a lot of time eating food.

[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.360]
Out there on the food court, wandering around in the lobby,

[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.400]
buying a memorabilia, whatever else.

[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:20.400]
That's what we're going to be doing.

[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:23.600]
Here's big pine key. Hello.

[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:24.400]
Hello.

[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:25.120]
Yes, sir.

[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:25.960]
Mr. Rogers.

[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:26.680]
Yes, I am.

[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.980]
I've listened to you for years, for probably about

[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.800]
ever since you've been on the air.

[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:32.160]
Yes.

[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.080]
It's been an orange fan.

[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:38.840]
A day before yesterday, the last half hour between 11 and 12,

[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:39.440]

[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.200]
It's elevated to $1.3,

[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:49.220]
because what you articulated so eloquently about...

[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:49.720]
Are you good?

[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.800]
I mean, I'd give anything to have a tape without I was working.

[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.660]
What was I talking about?

[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.740]
There was so outstanding ingredient. Let me hear it.

[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.000]
I'll do it again. I'll do it quickly.

[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:01.160]
Oh, God.

[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:08.740]
You were talking about people influencing their religiosity,

[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:12.060]
regurgitating, viewing, and that's right.

[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.820]
I'll let the spoon fit half.

[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:14.200]
Right.

[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:15.760]
Keeping their eyes...

[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:16.980]
Why should I keep it to themselves?

[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.200]
I mean, intolerance here.

[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:18.980]
I'm not talking about it.

[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.640]
These were tolerant people. They'd understand, hey, this is what I believe.

[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.000]
If you don't believe that, so can we just won't talk about it.

[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.620]
And then we would never even discuss it.

[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.100]
We never even discuss it.

[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.040]
Believe whatever free entails you want to believe.

[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.700]
Don't put it on your goddamn car.

[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:32.200]
Don't come knock it on my door.

[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.280]
Don't start putting newspaper ads in the paper.

[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.100]
Tell me that I'm this.

[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.220]
I'm that I should be the...

[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:37.100]
Tell me what I should be.

[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.620]
Just be whatever you want to be.

[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:39.540]
Okay, don't hurt anybody.

[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.180]
And that's it.

[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:40.840]
Very simple.

[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:44.580]
We don't need any big complicated philosophy or any big black book

[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.300]
to tell us how to be a decent person.

[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.980]
Everybody in the world knows the answer to that.

[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:51.260]
But we've got to have all those focus, focus, and a bunch of intolerant assholes

[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:53.360]
like the Crusades and all the other bull crap.

[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.520]
Onward Christian soldier, I have just said...

[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:55.620]
Right, just a bit.

[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:56.860]
I hate to...

[01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:57.040]
Yeah.

[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.080]
...for that crap.

[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:05.420]
It occupies my mind constantly because I'm constantly inflicted with that crap on.

[01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:11.580]
There's a stupid bumper sticker in the stupid pamphlet, in the door, in the motel room,

[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.100]
everywhere.

[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.060]
That's right.

[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.380]
You go to one motel, you open up the drawer, there's a guy named Stupid Bible in there.

[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:20.840]
There's a Bible, of course in Vegas, it's a Bible because the blue prayer there can't hurt.

[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:21.380]
You need that.

[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.220]
Well, it was a...

[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:25.560]
But any place else, what is a Bible doing in my drawer and a motel room?

[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:26.440]
And of course, you know what?

[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.300]
Most people at Ren Motelroom's for 20 years.

[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:29.400]
That's what they're doing in there, okay?

[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.460]
It was a cut starting.

[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:32.640]
That they were doing in the Bible, they were beginning and beginning.

[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.140]
It was a cut starting experience for me yesterday, or a day before yesterday.

[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:42.420]
If you ran that again, or will it make it to the TV show, I'll tape it, I'll tape it.

[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:43.600]
Oh, sure, I'm sure it'll be on there.

[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.540]
Oh, just keep tape in that way and you think.

[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:47.200]
Thank you.

[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:47.880]
And that was...

[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:55.560]
What gets me the words is, they cling even more tenaciously to it when they feel threatened.

[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:00.600]
You ask them for a little reason, a little thought, and all you get is a scrap about space.

[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:02.460]
Oh, well, you just blind space.

[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:02.840]
Yeah.

[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:04.920]
All right, thank you.

[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.020]
Hey, Liz, it was a good start.

[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:06.400]
That was great.

[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:06.660]
Thank you.

[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:06.960]
All right.

[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:10.200]
So anyway, what the hell was I doing before you?

[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.320]
Why, he's a little bit worked up.

[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.860]
That's the moral Christ compend you.

[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:14.400]
To do a spot.

[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:19.300]
21 till noon at 560 WQM, we have an open line in day 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.300]
pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:22.840]
Jesus loves you.

[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.440]
Oh, yes, Jesus is the way.

[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:25.580]
Your home is the way.

[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:26.420]
Oh, you're fine.

[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:27.160]
Go find them.

[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:28.120]
Okay, get on the right road.

[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:28.620]
Get on the right.

[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:29.420]
You're on the wrong highway.

[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.120]
Okay, because Jesus is the end of the end of this highway.

[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:32.360]
Get on some other highway.

[01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:35.000]
Quick putting that stuff in front of my purse and go have a great life.

[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:39.240]
And of course, when you look at the people who are driving those cars,

[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.900]
then it gives you a little insight as to what we're talking about.

[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.280]
If you want to like make some...

[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.780]
Hey, you know, Barley,

[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:50.460]
you're helping all the boys on a catwalk.

[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:03.920]
It's not surprising.

[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.760]
If you know we need you to drive the force all the jumps to the level we need,

[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.940]
a lot of our birds are not in all of our roles.

[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.600]
I'm just a president of my twin wall row.

[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.640]
So all you need now is that in order to really want the love of the child,

[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:21.060]
so for all of our...

[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.600]
Yeah, eating up my cooking cover,

[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.780]
some energy box does it her own burn.

[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.820]
I just want to get some...

[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:30.700]
Malaysia...

[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.400]
Okay, may I go?

[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:36.860]
Oh, Malaysia...

[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:41.420]
Oh, Malaysia...

[01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:44.260]
Oh, that's what I like.

[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.740]
Oh, my goodness.

[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:53.540]
Maybe we're both dumb, marijuana.

[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:56.860]
I bet I'll show you my big taste, marijuana.

[01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:58.500]
I'm not the last dog,

[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.520]
like the fondle of the fake adduance,

[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:02.680]
bitter and swallow.

[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:05.800]
I just want to get some...

[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.940]
Malaysia...

[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:17.860]
I just want to get some...

[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:19.860]
Malaysia...

[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.240]
Oh, Malaysia...

[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:21.240]

[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:21.240]

[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:21.760]
Oh, maybe not...

[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.960]
Oh, Malaysia...

[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:31.860]
Malaysia...

[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.280]
Malaysia...

[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.940]
Malaysia...

[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.760]
Malaysia...

[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:40.200]
Malaysia...

[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:41.080]
Malaysia...

[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.440]
Oh, Malaysia...

[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.960]
And I was out of alcohol, Steve.

[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.180]
Last meal.

[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.540]
Yeah, first of all, I think one more meal and he's just going to explode.

[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.740]
In fact, he got on the scale of...

[01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:56.020]
Oh, my God, all the fat people are showing up today.

[01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:58.240]
First, there was no more my Kent,

[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:00.820]
then there was tons of fun, alcohol, Steve.

[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.060]
And now...

[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:03.380]
Oh, what a graver.

[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.020]
Who actually, I think, lost some weight.

[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:06.780]
Did you lose some weight?

[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.200]
All right. What do you think I can't say that people used to be?

[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:11.920]
Of course, I always just hear so by comparison,

[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:12.500]
you look like a...

[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.440]
You look like VT.

[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:16.160]
Like he's doing the VT's in there.

[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.080]
Yeah, okay.

[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.260]
Hey, by the way, that cross-guy amphitheater is...

[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:21.040]
...the best.

[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.800]
Okay, where we going? Let's do...

[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.980]
We got to hurry up here. We got two videos to give away before noon.

[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:26.580]
Oh, Chester and Virginia, hello.

[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:28.840]
Yeah, this was pretty wild.

[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:30.280]
I'm sitting here at the office.

[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.380]
We can't get radio, but I can't get internet.

[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:33.400]
How do you like that?

[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:34.760]
Pretty damn good.

[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:35.700]
Thank God for the video.

[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:38.020]
Well, they want to see video on the internet.

[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.260]
You keep on talking about David, you can't say anything.

[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.520]
That's great. That's the idea.

[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:43.060]
You're teasing me.

[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.100]
Got a teaser imagination.

[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.560]
You have practice makes perfect.

[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.060]
What have you got lost on videos?

[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.200]
Some stuff that you can't have in Virginia.

[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.460]
Okay, where we going?

[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:51.880]
Let's go to...

[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.780]
Whenever there's something that we started sending stuff to Virginia,

[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.900]
it's probably up there by DC.

[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:56.900]
Here's Miami. Hello?

[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:57.340]
Neil.

[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:57.940]
Yes, sir.

[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.660]
You know what's the funny thing about these religious months?

[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:00.340]
And what is that?

[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:02.500]
These are the same people who go to the corner shop,

[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:05.700]
and they were the leather necklaces with the spikes and stuff.

[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:06.120]
Uh-huh.

[01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:08.400]
And wait for something to pick them up so they can give them a stiff one eye.

[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:08.780]
Right.

[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:10.080]
You know, and they...

[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.060]
They just...

[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:11.200]
Yeah.

[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:13.420]
And they take the collection place and take all the quarters

[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:15.140]
and the loose dollars and stick them on the peeps show

[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:16.060]
and go ahead and have a good time.

[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:16.480]
Yeah.

[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:18.560]
And then they go ahead and condemn everybody else.

[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.040]
Now, do you say half dollars because I know what place is getting better?

[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:22.500]
There's no fact in the church.

[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:22.920]
Yeah.

[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.620]
Can I stick around for a moment?

[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:24.980]
Well, hang on.

[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.340]
In fact, here's one called...

[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.880]
Fuckers, okay, hang on.

[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:29.860]
Well, he said he wants to suck around.

[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.340]
Okay, that's on line three.

[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.800]
Take care of our fine friend there, all right?

[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.120]
He knows what side it's on.

[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.380]
He said what I wanted to hear.

[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.500]
He said the truth is what he said.

[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:38.960]
There's no fact in the church.

[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:39.880]
Or something like that.

[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.800]
Well, we're gonna have Josie right in mobile on there right now.

[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:43.220]
That's...

[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:44.860]
I don't want you to overwork yourself.

[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.900]
I realize it's an extra couple of letters on there.

[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.660]
I mean, he's in training here this morning doing this.

[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.680]
I don't want him to overdo it, especially since we never got that check to give them

[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.560]
for my good friend Adam in sales for that spot I recorded about 10 years ago.

[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.100]
Well, that's like everything else here.

[01:13:59.240 --> 01:13:59.560]
It's working.

[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.440]
Trickles in real slowly.

[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:05.420]
Okay, if you just sit back in dummy of some day when you're like that 50 bucks I got there,

[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:06.400]
I still don't know what it's for.

[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.860]
I'm sure they owe it to me probably for my so far a little bit long ago.

[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.580]
Adam, I'm gonna tell it's for it.

[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:13.340]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:13.720]
Hello?

[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:16.320]
Mobile in Miami?

[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:17.200]
Hello?

[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:17.840]
Yes, sir.

[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:18.820]
No.

[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:22.440]
I'm here in my house, looking for radio.

[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:23.980]
And how come you're on a mobile phone?

[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.020]
I don't know.

[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:27.760]
Uh-huh.

[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.820]
I'm listening to this guy sitting here talking about your own damn base.

[01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:31.480]
Uh-huh.

[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:33.920]
And I say, well, I call him here a little no.

[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:34.780]
And who is that?

[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:35.560]
I don't know.

[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:37.640]
Some guy on Power 96 was talking about you.

[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:38.240]
Oh, Don Cox?

[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:39.960]
Yeah, I think that's his name.

[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.440]
Maybe he's an asshole.

[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:42.760]
He's an asshole, don't worry about him.

[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.740]
Okay, let's go to a nut.

[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.200]
Don Cox is talking about me on Power 96 for what?

[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:48.420]
We don't want nothing to do with you.

[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:49.400]
Don't you understand, Cox?

[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.040]
We don't want nothing to do with you when you're big fat ass.

[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:52.960]
Just stay out of here.

[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:56.420]
I mean, I enjoy when our gold thing comes in until he's third life.

[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.480]
And you know something, our gold thing was not joking.

[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.120]
That's the thing that's scary about him.

[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:04.280]
Any contact with you in flesh that he can like fake his way through.

[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.180]
I mean, this guy is really confident.

[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.260]
I feel here is what he's doing.

[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:08.180]
This is not a joke.

[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.500]
That's what I'm serious.

[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:12.380]
He puts on an act like, ah, it's just a big joke.

[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.320]
But in the meantime, he's grabbed it and squeezed it in touch.

[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:17.820]
And then you can tell when somebody means it and you're just revolted.

[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:22.800]
I'd rather make mad passion at love to fat Joe in there than ever touch our gold thing.

[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.880]
I'd rather die before I even think about through a touching fat Joe.

[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:27.020]
So what is that?

[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:28.860]
Does that put in its proper perspective?

[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:29.800]
Man.

[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:31.400]
Good.

[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:32.600]
God almighty.

[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:34.080]
Al stayed a hell of a way.

[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.960]
And then he gives me those same keys again.

[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.880]
The same Phantom keys to his, here you go.

[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.200]
Yeah.

[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.740]
To his joint and Amsterdam.

[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.060]
Yeah, he's got a lot of joints in Amsterdam.

[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:47.320]
But you know, it would like a little nicer paintball on it too,

[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.900]
just to be a little shot, a little comet.

[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:51.260]
And he still don't fit.

[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.920]
Yeah, you've got a twisted mianca and turn it.

[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:54.980]
I'm twisted in the acutus.

[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:55.300]
Okay.

[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.500]
And it still doesn't go in there.

[01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.240]
Here's a Hollywood, hello.

[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.140]
Good morning, you're?

[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:01.560]
Yes, sir.

[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.780]
So he's being Hollywood?

[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:03.460]
Yes.

[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:06.420]
Any other reference to the news arena?

[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:07.220]
I was up there.

[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.200]
I have to split in there a couple weeks ago to pick a quick look.

[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.900]
And I'm up there, then I'm fetching you as a Walic and Nosebleed.

[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:18.760]
And around that there's four or six of those.

[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:48.740]
And you're going to be like, you're going to be like,

[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:48.740]

[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:48.740]

[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:48.740]

[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:48.740]

Number five, signs right up your alley.

[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.460]
Hang on, pal. Okay. See you around, hey.

[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.860]
Thank you. Hang on. Okay. There's one of our Canadian

[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:56.800]
Paisons, one of the English speaking Canadians,

[01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:58.580]
the ones we like, I suppose, to those,

[01:19:58.720 --> 01:19:59.640]
you know what I'm talking about,

[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:00.380]
frogs.

[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.960]
Well, you know, the status part, I had a great time

[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:06.280]
at the Iranian yesterday, meant all my close personal friends,

[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.580]
Captain VM and Bill Tury and Tury.

[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.480]
But Tury Murray is a great guy. Let me say it again.

[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.340]
Like Tury Murray, I hope you have rest of the luxury.

[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:13.580]
You'll need it with this outfit.

[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.860]
But I was there a little, and Randy Moore was there,

[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.700]
good old Randy, but I missed my close personal friend,

[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:22.420]
Denise Pothman and me. I just missed him by a few minutes.

[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:24.240]
And I went home and I thought to myself,

[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:27.440]
I feel really, really happy because I didn't see my close personal,

[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:29.160]
dumb frog friend, Denise Pothman.

[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:30.160]
Five minutes.
