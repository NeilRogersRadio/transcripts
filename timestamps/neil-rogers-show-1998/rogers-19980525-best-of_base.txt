[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180]
Here to you find Marlin's baseball, Dolphin's football, and Panther's hockey right where you got it.

[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.420]
Sports radio, 560 Q-A-M.

[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.000]
Anybody have a heart or a liver?

[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.440]
And no, it's the continuing episodes of Beaver and Buttha.

[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.440]
That's cool. Look, I'm stroking my weiner.

[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.320]
You're not going to get a chance on my tour, are you?

[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.280]
That would be cool.

[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.920]
The tune in next time is Buttha, that's Mr. Cleaver.

[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.700]
Could you pick your butt with your nose?

[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.180]
Of course not.

[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.620]
Well, 14 on 560 WQM, we have two open lines in date.

[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.560]
560 7 0 5 60 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.280]
Here's a mobile and Davy. Hello?

[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.920]
Hey, um, am I on?

[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.760]
All right, I just wanted to comment real quick, but the TV spot, I saw on 560, so you have

[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.440]
a mug on there?

[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.340]
You rejected a lot when you were young men?

[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.420]
Yes, by women.

[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.220]
No, no, only by guys.

[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.420]
I mean, I never asked you.

[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.280]
That's how you're mugged on there.

[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.880]
I never asked you.

[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.060]
And what do you look like, my hot shot friend, and Davy?

[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.480]
You doing your horse this week or what?

[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.880]
Oh, you turned you down?

[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.760]
Sorry.

[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.580]
Two open lines in a day.

[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.700]
See, that's why we're on radio.

[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.260]
Me, Hank, all of us here on the station.

[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.860]
We're all ugly.

[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.500]
We all know it.

[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.980]
We admit it.

[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.740]
But unlike hot guys like you and Davy, you have seen your crowd.

[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.380]
He's probably ahead of for adventure right now.

[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.080]
Two open lines in day one and powered.

[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.800]
560, 705, 60 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.080]
Here's Markey.

[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.740]
Hello?

[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.500]
Hello?

[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.040]
Hey, how are you, Neil?

[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.520]
Okay.

[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.860]
Is that two like yours and you are lover?

[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.640]
No, it's not.

[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.200]
No?

[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.000]
No, you and me?

[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.960]
I think is what it is.

[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.380]
You sound more like his type.

[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.060]
Two open lines in day one and powered.

[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.880]
560, 705, 60 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.020]
Mobile in Boca, hello?

[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.800]
Yeah.

[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.040]
I got to tell you that it's just sick.

[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.500]
Anything like that is just sick.

[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.120]
Sorry, I know that's your preference, but I actually...

[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.780]
What is sick?

[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.440]
I mean, doesn't it stink?

[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.120]
Doesn't...

[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.060]
Doesn't what's sick?

[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.220]
You know, giving it up to poofs, too.

[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.960]
I don't know, sir.

[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.580]
I don't get it up to poofs, you do?

[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.080]
Uh, that would be a no.

[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.580]
Uh-huh.

[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.820]
Do you have any idea what gay sex is all about?

[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.360]
Or is that the only thing you know is anal sex?

[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.100]
Is that your idea what gay people do?

[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.860]
Let me ask you something.

[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.160]
Are there straight people that do that?

[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.780]
No.

[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.760]
Straighten other straight guys don't...

[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.500]
Are not interested in anal sex with their women?

[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.520]
That will be correct.

[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.940]
No, no.

[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.940]
You either do it with your...

[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.100]
Sir, sir, let me say it again.

[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.740]
Straight guys don't...

[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.640]
Are not interested in giving anal sex to women?

[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.480]
Is that what you just said?

[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.880]
No, no, no, that's not what I said.

[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.200]
I just ask you the question.

[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.180]
You said no, they're not.

[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.780]
I misunderstood you, sir.

[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.440]
So why would it be disgusting if gay people did it?

[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.240]
But if you want to do it to a woman, then it's okay.

[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.620]
Because it's still the opposite sex.

[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.980]
I mean, if you decide to do it with the same sex...

[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.960]
Well, well, but then what you're saying is any kind of sex with the same sex is disgusting.

[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.000]
That would be correct.

[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.560]
Okay, now, have you ever watched Lesbian Pornom movies?

[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.060]
Uh, not Lesbian.

[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.340]
I don't like Lesbian Pornom movies.

[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.260]
So, in other words, Lesbian...

[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.500]
Are a straight man on top sitting over with a quick-sized sex?

[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.100]
Uh-huh.

[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.380]
Okay, so in other words, uh, Wambam, thank you, man.

[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.700]
There you go.

[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.000]
Okay.

[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.800]
He wants to use a woman as a receptacle.

[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.480]
That's his idea of a great loving relationship and what sex is all about.

[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.920]
There you go.

[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.420]
To reach his own more power to you, pal.

[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.260]
He's headed for Avengera.

[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.780]
Always headed for Burdine, sorry.

[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.780]
We have an open line in the Broward, 5667-0560.

[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.240]
That's the thing that really cracks me up.

[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.780]
SNM, that's disgusting only fags do that.

[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.240]
Right.

[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.360]
Anal sex, that's disgusting.

[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.660]
Only fags are doing it.

[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.780]
Come on, honey, turn over.

[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.920]
It's the way.

[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.420]
Right.

[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.800]
Here's a mobile in my...

[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.020]
In addition to which, nobody cares whether you think it's disgusting or not.

[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.860]
I couldn't care less.

[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.800]
Whatever the act is.

[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.120]
Uh, nobody cares about that.

[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.880]
That's not the point.

[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.860]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.240]
Hello?

[00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.660]
No.

[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.180]
Yes, sir.

[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.260]
How you doing, my brother?

[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.540]
I'm talking about how things smell.

[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.340]
But anyway, yes, sir?

[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.800]
Okay, it's been a while.

[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.060]
I don't hear you talking about a dude, guys.

[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.800]
He's stealing the steel on Miami.

[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.320]
I mean, stealing from the people.

[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.480]
Sir, what are you talking about?

[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.020]
What language would you be speaking, sir?

[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.560]
Well, the police, I mean, I don't hear you talking about it, man.

[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.540]
Yeah.

[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.520]
You see what I mean, how I talk?

[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.800]
Those politicians, those commissioners of the...

[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.820]
Yeah, well, go down and tell to them, okay, where we're aboard with your crap, okay?

[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.520]
We're not interested.

[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.620]
That's what we're not talking about.

[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.200]
Nobody cares.

[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.100]
We're used to it.

[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.100]
Open line in Broward, 5667-0560.

[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.160]
On the AT&T wireless line.

[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.920]
So basically, what we learned from the audience today is that I'm mean to the callers

[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.360]
and that I'm not talking about the right stuff.

[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.800]
And that any kind of gay sex is disgusting and revolting.

[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.020]
But if this guy wants his woman to turn over and bam, that's okay.

[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.640]
Then it's a beautiful, loving thing.

[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.820]
Oh, God, that's good.

[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.080]
Right.

[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.300]
Here's Miami.

[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.680]
Hello.

[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.820]
Hello, Neil.

[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.800]
How you doing?

[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.280]
Listen to me.

[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.640]
I need you to help me out with something.

[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.000]
So what is it?

[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.840]
It's a straight guy.

[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.000]
It's from another guy or he's the receiver.

[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.960]
He's the receiver, shall we say?

[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.000]
Right, oral sex, yes.

[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.300]
So what?

[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.840]
He's gay or what?

[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.440]
No, he's not.

[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.440]
He's not, huh?

[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.340]
I think the word was horny as you're looking at it.

[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.480]
Listen, since my name's not on here or something, I'll be really honest, man.

[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.640]
A couple months ago, how is that the beach down here in North Miami Beach?

[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.200]
Yes, sir.

[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.300]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.280]
Right?

[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.940]
And what you're talking about the beach in North Miami Beach, yeah.

[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.660]
I had a little encounter in the bathroom.

[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.240]
Yeah.

[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.100]
And I'm a straight guy.

[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.660]
I think I'm straight, but I gotta be honest, man.

[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.900]
What the guy did-

[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.500]
Well, what do you mean you think you're straight?

[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.460]
I know I am.

[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.980]
I know I am.

[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.400]
Are you married?

[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.500]
Yes, I am.

[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.940]
Yeah.

[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.760]
And you know what?

[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.520]
The guy did certain things that I don't think I could ever get from my wife.

[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.900]
Exactly.

[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.700]
Honestly, I'm- and I'm being honest.

[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.140]
I mean, this is something I'm going to disclose to every single friend of mine.

[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.320]
Let me ask you this.

[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.380]
Does your wife have a penis?

[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.600]
Obviously not.

[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.420]
Obviously not.

[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.820]
So she doesn't know that much about one.

[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.400]
Hey, well, that's my point.

[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.080]
That's my point.

[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.720]
And you know what?

[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.420]
I can have experience with thousands of them, but unless you've got your own, you'll never

[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.700]
really truly understand what it's all about.

[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.060]
You're an exact, certain things, etc.

[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.680]
But I wanted to hear something else.

[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.700]
It's like a breast, you know.

[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.980]
I mean, you and I don't have a breast so we can never really know better.

[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.100]
How many breasts you may have found?

[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.540]
You know what?

[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.080]
I'm actually-

[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.740]
You never really truly understand what a breast is.

[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.240]
What it feels like.

[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.200]
And exactly and how to properly massage or etc.

[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.140]
But you know, there you go.

[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.660]
I graduated from a- from a high school down here in a- and Dave County.

[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.100]
Yeah.

[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.060]
And listening to your-

[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.220]
Not Columbia.

[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.140]
Not Columbus.

[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.840]
Why?

[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.200]
Let me just say, listening to your show, I didn't know there were so many, you know, I hate

[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.120]
to say the word, but bags of that- that's cool.

[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.720]
It's a Lynn Jesuit.

[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.600]
It's what?

[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.680]
The Lynn Jesuit.

[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.600]
Oh my God.

[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.020]
And now I'm a fact in the church.

[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.700]
You know what?

[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.340]
I've been calling my friends and everything and they're like, yeah, right.

[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.960]
You never knew.

[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.440]
Yeah, right.

[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.460]
I'm like, no, I never knew.

[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.080]
It turns out-

[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.740]
You were like George.

[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.980]
You were very naive in the living in a sheltered world.

[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.380]
That's right.

[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.620]
But even though you thought you were Mr. Hotchide and it would all-

[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.860]
Exactly.

[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.400]
Well, I thought exactly.

[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.680]
You know, I'm calling my friends now and I'm telling them.

[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.420]
And then of course, I'm not going to say anything with this pod-

[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.280]
You tell them everything, but it turns out this guy could tell you glory holds

[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.000]
throughout Dave, Rowered West Palm County and everything.

[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.660]
Let me say it again, when you hear this drilling sounds and then conventionally, that's when you get up and run and call for the-

[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.220]
Popen of police.

[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.740]
Hopefully not the Pope.

[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.640]
Neil, anyways, I love your show.

[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.700]
But I have to be honest, that fish who is not for me, Matt, I'm a diabetic and that's probably kill me.

[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.560]
Don't do it.

[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.180]
Exactly.

[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.260]
Okay, feet at the beach, pal.

[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.760]
Thanks a lot.

[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.000]
Alright.

[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.640]
There you go.

[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.240]
Rest my case.

[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.340]
There's the best call of the year.

[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.740]
See if you keep fishing around and fish around a lot of the time, you'll find an honest person out there.

[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.320]
An honest person with some balls.

[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.840]
I'm not interested in your comment.

[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.100]
Because no matter what they say, you're going to disagree because you're one of these know-it-alls

[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.080]
who thinks that you know everything and you don't.

[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.580]
You're wrong.

[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.420]
Like the guy who called me for about, you know, well, it's a dirty down there.

[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.780]
Well, let me ask you something, pal.

[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.720]
Speaking of things that smell and maybe ain't that clean.

[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.600]
Oh, God.

[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.060]
Oh, God.

[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.100]
Thank God I didn't have no lunch today.

[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.380]
But you don't know anything about that.

[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.920]
You've never been down there.

[00:07:59.220 --> 00:07:59.780]
No, I have not.

[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.380]
And you know what?

[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.420]
I have no interest.

[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.060]
Oh, in other words, you're telling me that it's always a beautiful, lovely thing.

[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:05.620]
Is that what you're saying?

[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.000]
Not always.

[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:06.700]
Oh, okay.

[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.620]
I mean, here's a guy that's got 40 pounds of pecorino cheese his own problems and he's worried about other people's privates.

[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.800]
Oh, this clean is a whistle.

[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:14.320]
Yeah, right.

[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.980]
I don't hear nobody whistling.

[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.060]
Yeah.

[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.500]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:20.860]
Give me, hello.

[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.280]
Yeah, no, no.

[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:24.480]
Yes, sir.

[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.380]
Yeah, I just want to say there's no bags in the church or a bag there are four legs.

[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.480]
You're just bags.

[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:32.780]
You're one.

[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.600]
Okay, great.

[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.140]
All right.

[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.640]
Guys, what language he be speaking, huh?

[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:37.300]
Good.

[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.260]
God, almighty.

[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.900]
I said we had a lot of sparsars listening.

[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.020]
I didn't say we wanted them calling.

[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:47.380]
We have an open line in date, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.420]
Where we be going?

[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.380]
Oh, a lady mobile in Miami Beach.

[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:51.640]
Hello.

[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:53.460]
Hello.

[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.420]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.680]
No, I love your show.

[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.640]
Long time listener never has the nerve to call.

[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.440]
But after listening to these guys calling, I just, I had to get up the nerve and dial the phone.

[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.860]
Well, good for you, I think.

[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.900]
Because I don't know what country that I've, I don't know where they're from, they're nuts.

[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.220]
And they're all full of it because I'll be honest and I'll grow a pair for the show.

[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:16.640]
Okay.

[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.920]
I've had three sons and they are exciting as hell.

[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.080]
And with my boyfriend and another guy.

[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.560]
And my guy is not gay.

[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.640]
But when you go forward, you go for it.

[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:31.440]
Yeah.

[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.740]
And it doesn't make any less man or anything else.

[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.560]
I mean, what's the big deal?

[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.840]
Is it everything okay?

[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.200]
As long as it's okay with the people that are doing it?

[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:41.320]
Right.

[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.820]
Or over 21 or whatever?

[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:44.620]
29.

[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.500]
18, whatever.

[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.760]
You know, I mean, what's the big deal?

[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.120]
I mean, is it the 90s?

[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.040]
Like, get over it.

[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.100]
It's the gay 90s, right?

[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.820]
It's the gay 90s, that's right.

[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:54.660]
But get over it.

[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.900]
And I wanted to tell you that I tried fishboots for the first time.

[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.300]
And I had the funds a long time.

[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.240]
I had really had the funds for it.

[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.920]
It's not really available to much of my MAB.

[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.320]
Oh, thank God for that.

[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.820]
We do want to put those old people right over the end.

[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.180]
You put them away.

[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:11.300]
Yeah.

[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:17.360]
And I'm a long time couch potato with a, with a, I know how to do a pint, man, but I couldn't do it.

[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.060]
I couldn't do that whole pint.

[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:19.820]
Too rich?

[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:20.700]
So much.

[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:21.600]
Yeah, too much.

[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.160]
Too rich.

[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:22.900]
Too rich.

[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:23.820]
Too rich.

[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:24.420]
Too fabulous.

[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.460]
But it took me twice.

[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:32.100]
You know something I had, I was thinking yesterday, what would be really great would be to take a pint of fishboot in a big bowl.

[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.800]
And to cover it with either smarties, which most people don't know that.

[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.480]
So you take M&Ms, I guess, would have to settle.

[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.100]
Cover it with M&Ms and then put it in the microwave for about 30 seconds.

[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.320]
Oh my God.

[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.340]
You would be right off the edge of the mat.

[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.980]
Oh my God.

[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.340]
Did you say you were a diabetic?

[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:49.920]
Yeah.

[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.000]
And you're not dead yet.

[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:51.400]
No.

[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:51.820]
No.

[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.220]
No, I just want to, I'm just trying to prove a point.

[00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:00.060]
I have to tell you one more thing, I'll have to spoke just over it only because I've heard you scream about it.

[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.840]
And I've always, you know, when I'm listening in my car, I shake my head and say, yeah, yeah.

[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.340]
What's up with these New York fans and you can hear by my accent?

[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.580]
That's the wrong problem, right?

[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:09.280]

[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.840]
What's up with these New York fans with this, this Patrick Ewing fetish?

[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.860]
What is up with this?

[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.520]
What's Patrick ever do for them?

[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.900]
It's who he is, he has a shot.

[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.760]
I don't know, maybe they're all anthropology students.

[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.480]
I have no idea.

[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.540]
Well, Pat Ewing looks like a mountain gorilla, but that's the point.

[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.880]
There you go, like I said.

[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.840]
That's by the point.

[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.720]
Have a great day, sweetheart.

[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:31.500]
You too.

[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.040]
Well, see ya.

[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.000]
You know, there are lots of places you can buy a mattress, you department store, your fancy bedding store.

[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.760]
But you know, the best place, think about it.

[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.380]
It's comfortable, you don't have to drive around for an hour looking for parking.

[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.700]
Remember, this is the best of Neil Rogers, no call today.

[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.560]
It's all been previously recorded, the best of Neil on 560 QAM.

[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.600]
It's all been previously recorded, the best of Neil on 560 QAM.

[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:02.720]
It's all been previously recorded, the best of Neil on 560 QAM.

[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.680]
It's all been previously recorded, the best of all three polls in June.

[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.400]
What's going on?

[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.340]
Water, 14 feet above the key of it, 10 minutes.

[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.460]
It's like I picked a wrong week, Chris Moher.

[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.680]
In the four feet, in all three holes, and in both room six.

[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.900]
It's like I picked a wrong week, Chris.

[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.960]
When can we get on the way, dammit?

[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.540]
You don't know where that finger's been.

[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.240]
That's five compartments, and it looks like a big tile and all.

[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.540]
She can stay afloat, with the first four compartments reached, but not fine.

[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.780]
How to barber a stairway?

[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:36.520]
Not to fight.

[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.080]
It's like I picked a wrong week, quid and phyto-meach.

[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.160]
The water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads.

[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:41.960]
There's no stopping.

[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.680]
Here, here, Geron, there's a fire in the barn.

[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.160]
From this moment no matter what you do.

[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.880]
Me, John, be treed.

[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.320]
Titanic will founder.

[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.660]
It is one of the tell you both good luck.

[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.780]
Raw counting on you.

[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.380]
I believe you may get your headlines, Mr. dismay.

[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.100]
There's a sale at pennies.

[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.000]
Jack, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls.

[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:00.000]
Where are you?

[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.040]
Where did you get that dress?

[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.280]
It's all on those shoes and that poche.

[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.780]
I wonder where it hangs out at pennies.

[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.520]
12.30 and 5.60 WQAM in the phone.

[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.840]
We got one line on there and everybody else has gone dead.

[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.080]
What a surprise on Monday, huh?

[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.360]
Yeah, we were going to grow a little longer.

[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.700]
I would say we were doing too well.

[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.640]
I was doing too well, but the audience, I give them about a C-minus still.

[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.500]
5.607 0560 all a day wide open, two and per hour,

[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.820]
Tom 560 on the 18t wireless line.

[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:28.960]
Mobile in Hellendale.

[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.200]
Hello.

[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.560]
Like I said, out of calls, that's the end today.

[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.680]
Moe did two and a half hours.

[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.860]
That's not bad to start the week.

[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.080]
Unfreaking, believeable this time.

[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.700]
This continues to be day after day after day.

[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.980]
Like the old San Jose, you get what you will, you know, deserve.

[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.360]
5.607 0560 pound 560 on the 18t wireless line

[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.180]
on your compulsive illegal gambling station.

[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.500]
I don't care about the nicks.

[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.360]
I don't care about the heat.

[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.700]
I don't care about Patrick Ewing.

[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.420]
I don't care about any of that crap, okay?

[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.460]
I don't care about the monkey jungle.

[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:03.740]
Not interested.

[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.700]
Or they're doing it there, too.

[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.040]
Here's the plantation. Hello.

[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.360]
Try to call your earlier.

[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.160]
Is he coming off?

[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.720]
Or is he playing the bagpipe?

[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.480]
Did you do it?

[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.360]
Hmm.

[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.380]
Reference playing the bagpipe.

[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.640]
Sure, the answer is, no.

[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.960]
If you call me again 15 minutes, it's still going to be in a half hour.

[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.160]
No.

[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.200]
In 45 minutes, two weeks from sookit, a year from Shivuas.

[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:26.420]
No.

[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.580]
Two days after Easter, good Friday.

[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:28.800]
No.

[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.920]
Two open lines in date and one in Broward.

[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.900]
5.607 0560 and pound 560 on the 18t wireless line.

[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.540]
Had a great appearance at Nixon Saturday.

[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.440]
Had a ton of people show up by the way, great time.

[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.720]
And then I came in here this morning with tons of material

[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.120]
with loads of crap and then we start taking phone calls.

[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.520]
I think eliminating phone calls could be the answer on this show.

[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:48.940]
You know what?

[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.540]
Any coming down?

[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.960]
I think just getting rid of the goddamn phone.

[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.500]
Just taking this instrument right the hell out of here might be the answer to this goddamn show.

[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.200]
Could be in this town after all these years wasted my time with this.

[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.880]
Here's a mobile and Jupiter. Hello.

[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:03.840]
Hi, Dale.

[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:04.320]
Yes, sir.

[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.720]
Hey, can you see Alan, the dude's the other now?

[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:08.180]
Yeah, we did.

[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:08.840]
Old story.

[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:09.980]
We're the Finns.

[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.200]
Yeah, we're the Finns.

[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:13.700]
Yeah, we're the Finns.

[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:13.820]
Yeah.

[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.360]
Oh, I can't keep the trip.

[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.000]
Yeah, okay.

[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.740]
Two open lines.

[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.700]
It's a day one and brown.

[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.480]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 10, 60.

[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.120]
You know something?

[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.480]
I don't even know why I go through that four play on the year.

[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.160]
The first hour today was like an hour of all kinds of good crap.

[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.120]
And he knows it because they never respond to any of it.

[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.080]
And then they're like all struggling for material.

[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.020]
But hey, did you hear it?

[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:33.960]
You heard our George Washington.

[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.340]
It wouldn't teeth anyone to the dead.

[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:35.800]
Yeah, right.

[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.760]
We heard about it.

[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.840]
Chopped down a cherry tree.

[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:38.280]
Two we heard.

[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.340]
Way, way, way behind.

[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.900]
I mean, they're like in the twilight zone.

[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.300]
They're 50 million years behind what's going on now.

[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.500]
Oh, do you hear the Marlins?

[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.200]
One of World Series.

[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:49.940]
Oh, my God.

[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.180]
Let's have a God damn parade.

[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:53.320]
Opalaka.

[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:53.580]
Hello.

[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.160]
Hello.

[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:55.740]
Yes, sir.

[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:56.620]
Yes.

[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.240]
Your opinion about straight guys, we've seen being sex from other guys.

[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.360]
Doesn't make them gay.

[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.540]
Is that a statement or a question?

[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:07.380]
Yeah.

[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.100]
That's a question.

[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.620]
My opinion why?

[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.240]
Of course, it doesn't make you gay.

[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.140]
What you do doesn't make you gay or straight.

[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.440]
You are whatever you are.

[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.540]
That makes you bisexual.

[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.680]
No, it does not.

[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.020]
Bisexual people are people who frequently have...

[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.320]
Let me ask you something.

[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.940]
When guys are adolescents, I don't know about girls.

[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.320]
I never was a girl, not yet.

[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.580]
But when guys are adolescents, they screw around with each other, right?

[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.220]
No.

[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.400]
I don't have a no.

[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:33.740]
Adela...

[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:33.960]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:34.580]
You're...

[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.400]
No, less than a day.

[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.460]
Only gay males screw around with each other when they're like teenagers?

[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.180]
Yeah.

[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.300]
Okay, thank you, sir.

[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.680]
Okay, that's the end of the show today.

[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.540]
You don't know that?

[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:46.920]
You don't know something?

[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:51.920]
It is so shocking to me that there are some people who are so repressed mentally, mentally,

[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.860]
who have do blocked things out in their lives.

[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.500]
And let me say it again.

[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.420]
Most young males do screw around, okay?

[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.800]
Because they're curious, because it feels good, because whatever the reason might be.

[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.360]
That doesn't make them gay.

[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:06.640]
It doesn't make them anything.

[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:07.660]
It makes them horny.

[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.560]
That's all it makes them.

[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.400]
I mean, this is frightening.

[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:13.800]
Yeah.

[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.300]
Terrifying.

[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:15.360]
Yeah.

[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.060]
Yeah, what?

[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.840]
Do you have the way around?

[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:20.620]
It's frightening.

[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.220]
Yeah, oh yeah, well, too bad.

[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.280]
Too old to hide, is it?

[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:24.380]

[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.140]
565, 670, 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T Wireless Lines.

[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.500]
That, this guy is just...

[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:29.800]
Oh no!

[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.220]
Only fags do that, right?

[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:31.560]
Of course!

[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:32.800]
Right.

[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.640]
Okay, you're so full of crap.

[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.760]
You're so full of garbage.

[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.920]
Only fags do that when there are kids, right?

[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.400]
That's right.

[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.660]
I mean, what the hell would I know?

[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:41.820]
Here's Miramar.

[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.140]
Hello.

[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.080]
You?

[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:43.780]
Yes.

[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.700]
You ever drink?

[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.440]
Okay, yeah.

[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.280]
I'm trying to hang it up on an actual like you would have worked like a charm, yeah?

[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.480]
Two open lives at sea.

[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.760]
Now they're crumbling.

[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.320]
They're coming apart of the scenes this audience.

[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.920]
This massive gigantic audience.

[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.840]
They're falling apart because they can't cope with this.

[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.280]
See, I don't ordinarily even talk about stuff like this because I know that they can't

[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.820]
cope with it because this is the most neurotic, uptight sexual country.

[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:06.560]
I mean, it's okay.

[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.080]
The president's getting blow jobs and finally we've advanced to the point we can handle that.

[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.780]
We don't want to know about it, but we can handle it.

[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.740]
It's possible.

[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.480]
And the economy is good although the marketing is too good today, but nevertheless the

[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.480]
sky's been falling yet and so we can handle that.

[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.360]
But when it comes to our own attitudes about things, oh, then it's a whole different ball

[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:25.480]
game.

[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.560]
Well, nobody does that.

[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:26.940]
Okay.

[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.200]
I believe you.

[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.480]
In fact, the guys on the internet, they just made all this stuff up.

[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.160]
This is just a joke.

[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.760]
So Dwight Lauderdale was all stay was like Jerry Springer was just stage.

[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.360]
The whole staff from Channel 10 was in their Reyanke and Twisting and pulling and grab

[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.320]
it under the, you know, looking under the stall.

[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.780]
Here's a mobile implantation.

[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.040]
Hello.

[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.300]
Daniel.

[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:46.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.240]
Hey, I just called Taylor in your conversation.

[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.400]
So, forgive me if I'm tripping over what you've already talked about, but I'm a psychologist

[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:59.080]
and you're exactly right about the fermentation and homosexuality that the two are definitely

[00:18:59.080 --> 00:18:59.560]
not linked.

[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.580]
I mean, there are obviously homosexuals begin with experimentation.

[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:07.500]
You know, with experimentation, but that doesn't necessarily mean that if somebody is, you

[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:13.360]
know, at any time in their life is experimenting and there's, you know, in the sex or the same

[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.400]
sex that it doesn't have anything to do with their given sexuality.

[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:22.400]
I mean, if these very, very concentrated people realized how many game males were married

[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.300]
to women.

[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.060]
And the fact that they're having sex with those women and also having children in many

[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.220]
cases doesn't make them straight.

[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.240]
That's exactly right.

[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.140]
You are what you are.

[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.080]
You can't, I don't care what any song and a dance people try to give you about cures

[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.500]
and about psychotherapy and it's an you are what you are.

[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.280]
That's exactly right.

[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.620]
And Tony Perkins was a classic example of that.

[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:43.760]
Right.

[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:44.200]

[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.720]
He didn't get AIDS from his wife.

[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.860]
The same is also true though, to alleviating fears of, you know, men often come into therapy

[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:58.580]
with a lot of problems because they, at some point in their life, it engage in some homosexual

[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:03.500]
activity and they have these deep, deep fears that they exactly hit their day.

[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.900]
But that doesn't mean their day.

[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.260]
You know, it goes both ways.

[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.220]
Oh, how pathetic.

[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.360]
So that's all.

[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.280]
And I think that we got people uptight about sex education in this country.

[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.620]
What the people in this country know about sex.

[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.080]
I'm not talking about doing it.

[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.780]
But what they know about it is so minimal that it's frightening.

[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.820]
Well, if you know, if you look to history that the, the point in history were sexual diseases

[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:29.280]
and, you know, prostitution were at their highest was in the Victorian era when there was

[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.180]
the most repression.

[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:30.680]
Right.

[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.240]
So whenever you try to repress something, the more it's going to blossom in some other

[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:34.540]
area.

[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:35.560]
So.

[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.280]
Okay.

[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:36.980]
Thanks for having me.

[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.600]
Have a great day.

[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.100]
You know, there seem to be a zillion shoestores all over town.

[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.560]
But there's one that really is unique and far above the rest.

[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.160]
That's Brandy's in Pompedo Beach.

[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:57.280]
They said he was unstoppable from the heights of his career to his untimely death.

[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.120]
He was the white star line of the porno industry.

[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:07.100]
And now James Cameron brings his epic to the big screen.

[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:14.720]
Find out what got his huge ship up and the many lost souls that went down on it in

[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.260]
two hours and 20 minutes.

[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:25.020]
It's a long, long, real, long love story that'll have you on the edge waiting for the climax.

[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.820]
And when it comes, you will too.

[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:37.080]
Kate Winslet is the deep-lowered rose and Leonardo DiCaprio is John Holmes in gigantic

[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.060]
no showing.

[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.720]
Okay, 18 to a one and five sixty QA.

[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.500]
I'm so our faxer from the our internet expert.

[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.940]
I wonder if he uses my.

[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.340]
But anyway, well, he hops on it fast.

[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.580]
I can see that from these faxes.

[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.740]
Now he gives me the browardless.

[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.720]
Pretty small list by the way, but he's gone on here.

[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.340]
The sawdress mills mall and sunrise.

[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.000]
The restroom located near the target entrance inside the mall is very cruzy.

[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.420]
Young guys and tourists always looking for action.

[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.760]
JC Penny is always popular also popular.

[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.600]
Well, JC Penny, wow, I didn't realize.

[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.700]

[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:15.960]

[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.780]
Sixty to eighty percent of young men experiment.

[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.700]
Sixty to eighty percent of young men experiment with other young or young boys actually.

[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:53.140]
Right.

[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.960]
I'm reading it right out of a book here.

[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.000]
Well, if it's in a book, it must be true.

[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.140]
Yeah.

[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.960]
You know, it's interesting.

[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.740]
The guys that are young guys when I was a kid adolescent that I fool every single one of them

[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.800]
turned out to be straight and got married into head kid and a family.

[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.020]

[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.260]
How do you like that?
