[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]
chances he made a few things happen but he's using them in a wrong role

[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.100]
He won't put him on a point in the power play this guy thinks he's gonna come in here and rearrange the furniture

[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.000]
And he's gonna make a miracle from it and guess what most of it is the same old tired furniture that would nobody wants to buy

[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.340]
Right what you're saying is because I'm a former athlete and a coach that tries to play head games to think that the

[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.340]
Performance is gonna be better. That's it. That's a lot

[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.740]
Yeah, it was just like him pulling out Sean Burke

[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.160]
I mean you see this happen in games and it happens

[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.020]
Increasingly now because you know not because he played so bad because two of those first three goals were deflected

[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.620]
He had no chance

[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.820]
But to pull him out there and then put in Kirk McLean thinking again trying to play this head job

[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.800]
Like this is gonna wait the team up. They went into a deeper coma

[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.840]
Yes, stood around and they watched this poor Kirk McLean out there who's defenseless just watched him pop in one after another after another

[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.980]
I mean it was pathetic. It was it was humiliating

[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.360]
That that's the thing again with these re-treads and so on maybe they're there not that many new guys out

[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.240]
I'm sure there are some but here's the guy who's got a history of this and this will follow you for a reason because that's the way he acts

[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.060]
It will happen here like you're saying they will have to tend for him

[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.660]
This will this a big deal they beat these up

[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.700]
Sorry teams the first two games just like the dolphins at the beginning of the year

[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.320]
Okay, they can't match up with medium average talent let alone the Detroit and so on they will languish

[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.080]
I agree with you every every time we play a you know a

[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.780]
Decent team and they're playing they're not so many outstanding teams

[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.320]
But every time we play a decent team in Liga

[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.680]
I mean unless it's the wrong night and they're on the way but we're gonna get our ass kicked this year

[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.580]
And this they've got to make a lot of changes and I just don't see it happening as long as Wayne's got his fist out of first rings

[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.480]
You know just even a loan in business

[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.080]
Maybe the guy and keep in mind by the way if they would have given visa

[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.920]
It's a little bit more money that he wanted to stay here and I was mind up and making the scapegoat for all of their mistakes

[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.500]
They'd still have him right now instead of these two guys keeping my Kirk McLean is making two point or whatever made into an

[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.560]
App they got five million dollars worth of stifle tending out there is what they've got

[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:06.400]
No, no, no, that was another croc that excuse to blame the beazer or blame this one or blame how about blaming themselves with Chris Wells

[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.080]
Okay, and and all these other

[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.420]
They look good. He looks good in the suit up there in the stands have a great day pal

[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.280]
We have an open he's pissed off and fired up. That's one

[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.300]
There you go. He's sick and tired of being lied to and hear all the bull crap

[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.900]
And like I said if the games were free, hey, you know, okay, and you take it or leave it and

[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.000]
The prices just keep going up fan up fan up and okay

[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.220]
You had to have an arena so we can make some money for you. Okay. We build you the arena now put a quality product as a

[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.000]
Are you gonna do it for us? No, of course not

[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.500]
Of course not because it's the Wayne Meister because we owe him something. I guess that's what he thinks we owe him something

[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.320]
That the other way around

[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.500]
Here's Miami Springs hello

[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.740]
Yeah, I'm fired up. Yeah, I am pissed off. Yes, I'm not I am I'm listening

[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.580]
Okay, thanks. I think I got a piece of pants that I should have today. I thought it'd been really miserable

[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.680]
Hey, the game of

[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.360]
I agree I disagree with you on one point. I don't think we have a town out there

[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.880]
I don't think the players we have have have to have the town to keep up with the teens and the western

[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.980]
Comments that we did what he did

[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.360]
You said you said you said you have guys to town out there

[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.840]
It's the coaching is what you said

[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.840]
I didn't say that at all. I said we got a half a dozen guys. There were stiffs that they want to get rid of I said

[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.880]
I everybody I talked to with the game last night that phrase I used the same as last year

[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.000]
This team suffers from a lack of talent. That's it's those are my words

[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.700]
Absolutely, I remember the play we talked about in the second period when they tried to get off on that

[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.000]
But it was why I changed and then they got caught in the zone and they were running around for four minutes

[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.580]
It was that I have seldom seen anything like that in my life

[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.680]
I thought there was gonna be a riot the crowd was just foaming at them out and and keep in mind

[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.840]
This was at even strength there was nobody in a penalty line

[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.280]
I was trying to look like a five on three

[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.960]
We're trying to look like a five on one

[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.280]
We're chasing nobody. You know you're playing with us. It was embarrassing

[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.460]
They were playing with us like you like you like you like you said is men playing with you get boy

[00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.200]
That's what it looked like to me. All right. Yeah. Okay, pal. He got his pants or practical. He was up there and then I was bleed

[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.440]
Two open lines in date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on oh

[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.400]
Happy the morning to you Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Happy Thursday

[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.160]
I have to point well first of all I called you the day after the LA King's game and I told you you know if you didn't know anybody

[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.580]
It's where the guys they were trying to throw the L out of that place

[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.760]
Like you said the food wasn't ready in a certain time. Yeah, that's not ready the music's too loud. I mean

[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.520]
I mean they know ahead of time they know the day the games are gonna be they know the time that the goal

[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.200]
Are open up the doors how much effort does it take to get some people in there early to you know get stuff cooking a half hour ahead of time

[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.900]
So they're when the doors open whatever people want to spend their money on hey guess what here it is hope you enjoy it

[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.460]
Hope you have a good game something you know, but again, it's that time here's not that same way no one would be open it's worked a lot

[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.040]
You know

[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.140]
Uh

[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.380]
Seminar one time and they gave us things you saw lot

[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.840]
What would you say would be the 10 most important things that would go to employees and add a category lifting up money

[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.960]
This that and X-Stane clean restrooms all that other stuff in parks

[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.660]
And the first and in there was a category or a line that said employee friendly

[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.940]
Workplace and I put that down and this woman says that's kind of funny that you did that you know most people were to put on money

[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.520]
And I said well the money will come if everybody's happy

[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.440]
Uh, and you know as long as you keep the big people happy

[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.500]
They don't want to work for the company and this nonsense like you say nobody wants to say hello to each other and and I've got that

[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.940]
The same place I work out now

[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.940]
Second of all, I mean what kind of people are we talking about what kind of little punks?

[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.500]
If we got walking around here who think that they're big shots not not

[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.780]
I'm in if I'm just a guy that walks in here, okay?

[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.720]
I'm just a guy walks in here does a job and I walk out of here and I expected if I say

[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.220]
See the worst thing one of the most the rudest things that you can do to somebody besides bitching him out

[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.300]
It is not when they say hello to you just the

[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.820]
The stair to order don't exist. Yeah, what's the point?

[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.280]
What's the point did I shoot this guy's puppy dog? No, and did it is it gonna cost him anything?

[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.600]
But I should have understood because this is one of the same punks when I got on the elevator months ago

[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.260]
Decided he that I didn't know English and was speaking a foreign language so that he and his buddy in the elevator could carry on their private conversation

[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.560]
And that's another thing that I that used to drive me not some Polish in my mother

[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.620]
When I lived back up in Pittsburgh used to get on the horn when I was a kid with my grandmother

[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.340]
And they'd be talking English until she wanted to say something that she didn't want me to hear and then all of a sudden

[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.980]
He did it a little bit you can write and you know in that in to this day that drives me nuts down here

[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:38.180]
Second of all unacceptable. Yeah, right second of all if that guy that second caller thinks that one team the coach

[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.820]
Johnson yeah, before he passed away that was like Lemuse father

[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.620]
I mean they wanted a place for that guy in the worst way right Scotty Bowman comes in there after the man dies

[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.980]
They win another championship third year they got in he leaves

[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:59.480]
They've got the same team with probably one or two different faces on it and they get petty Johnson in there who had them before

[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.260]
The

[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.100]
Ron Johnson like I said before when you want to start brow-beating guys when you want to start

[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.440]
Trying to make examples of people today's athletes aren't gonna put off with that crap

[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.220]
They're not gonna go out there and put out for it. I'm telling you this team is not gonna play for Terry Murray

[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.920]
No matter how many submarine challenges Mitch from Bokeh makes him and his brother, okay?

[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.740]
We have an open line out of their system. We got no calls in date as usual here today

[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.140]
And a little bit of a four-year there's about 20 minutes

[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.380]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.220]
Palm 5 60 out of 18 T wireless line

[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.560]
Here's four-letter nail. Hello

[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.580]
Hello, yes sir. Oh, I'm on

[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.240]
Sounds like you

[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.380]
On the you are made we fan because of the affiliation from the whole roster

[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.880]
I don't know because I lived in Rochester in Toronto as you know is right across the lake

[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.060]
I was wrong. I by the time I started

[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:59.720]
Following hockey about 30 years ago. I think the Toronto dumps the Hamlin's and Vancouver is running to show and luxury as a

[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.380]
Whatever I could cure us. Yeah

[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:10.340]
The facts now you're kidding carried away. I'm confusing what with the best you're confusing them with the facts. Oh, they don't they'll get it

[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.560]
All right, there ain't you to step on you. Okay. Thank you. We have an open line at day one and broward

[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:20.020]
5 6 7 0 5 60 from strong and was George the chief Armstrong but nevertheless close but not a match

[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.280]
26. We're about old stuff from 100 years ago. I don't want to hear cross the old parts tell me about Johnny

[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.280]
Bowen Frank Mahavallich because I'll talk circles around you sir

[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.280]
It wasn't red arm strong. It was George the chief Armstrong and I could play bill you it and I can play that

[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.880]
Gold in the empty net at the end of the Canadians get but I'm not gonna do it

[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.560]
All these experts that's one of the problems we got down here and like I

[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.580]
It's just like this place. It's the same thing

[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.680]
The reason that Wayne does this stuff I've told you this before is because he can

[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:57.200]
He gets 19,132 people in that palace we built for him their last night

[00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.840]
Because he can

[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:10.000]
He could have put 400 pounds of cow crap out there any ice with a panther patrol running around slinging their crap up into the and he can do it

[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.440]
20,000 again the average for the marlins he came and slapped every fan in the face

[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.140]
He beat you until a blood was pouring out of your teeth. Yeah. Okay. Where do I sign up Wayne?

[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:28.460]
And that's why he keeps doing it because he can't be begging at big space. So that's one good thing

[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:34.380]
So this government's gonna spend billions of dollars in a couple of hours to send some old 77 year old senile fart

[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.820]
Open to space again because it wasn't good enough the first time. Okay. He deserves another shot at it. Okay

[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.600]
Yeah, that's just keep every time CNN keeps putting it like right now. There you go

[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.480]
They're covering it with a blanket

[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.680]
I just see his pussy that keeps coming to mind. I don't know what that means. You don't think I have a premonition do you?

[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.420]
Here's a mobile and pampered pine. Hello, you know, you said that the other day and I've been thinking about that all week

[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:03.800]
Yeah, I don't know what it is. You know, listening billions of dollars. We got people starving it as we got people making unwanted babies

[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.700]
We got kids

[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.420]
Freezing the death on the streets in the winter time and we're spending billions to send a scene our old fart in his compadre

[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.660]
Up there in the space again. So water conca I can make a comeback. Yeah, and then met him useful

[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:20.020]
I have a big up promo about that. We went into space and took it up and it's in the bag right right?

[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.260]
Listen, you know, uh, some things you say things and then I think wow, you know, I'm not the only one

[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.480]
You know, I was at the arena for the first time several weeks ago. Yeah

[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.660]
And I went in I believe it's the South entrance and I asked uh one of the people there in the uniform

[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.640]
I said where could I go to get you know, it's uh

[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:40.120]
Coke and then some chips. Mm-hmm. And the guy pointed to stairs right look like right when you walk in he says

[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.140]
Go up there. There's a bar there and you can get what you want. Mm-hmm. I said, okay, great

[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:49.560]
So I go up there. I ordered a Coca-Cola and I said, you know, get some chips. He goes, oh, this is just a bar

[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.420]
Drink solely you have to go downstairs to the snacking sessions fine. I take the drink downstairs

[00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:00.340]
This is very ask hard. I mean, you know real intimidating to me and he said you can't take the drink out here

[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.400]
Don't you see the sign?

[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.480]
Okay, and I said, well, you know the guy told me I don't care you cannot take the drink up there

[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.560]
But they go back up, you know drink my drink go back and you know

[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:15.060]
Just really a bad scene, you know, I'm saying plus it's embarrassing. I mean, I don't like to you

[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.940]
I'm kind of a witty guy. I guess you would say right, you know, I might go on to make a scene right? I don't want to make a scene

[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.480]
Getting that car impact that was practice

[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.400]
That's gonna be going on all year long one period two periods stop off at publics

[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.560]
All kinds of people scoring goals Edmonton got eight goals against those awful caps eight to two

[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.580]
Bruins nine to two over Montreal all kind of there's two barns

[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.120]
They're sticking a couple in for the penguins five two over Calgary

[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.920]
LA and at them incredible kid at

[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.360]
And what the legato legacy that kid he's unbelievable shutting out the jersey for nothing

[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.000]
All kinds of entertaining stuff on it was our game one of those no

[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.480]
I mean was on it, but was it entertaining? No, of course not here comes rubber you need a mile over to blula

[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.720]
Rimmer come on well, yeah

[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:36.540]
Jesus I understand you're on a payroll. You're trying to make it exciting. You don't have much to work with there

[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.500]
You got that frog next to you, but if you want to give me an honest

[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.120]
Amalization of the way they played these seven games. They start. Thank you

[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:53.800]
Now is this is this for real what you're putting on there is that for like ever? How is that a put on because we know a lot of

[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:58.040]
Damn yes, sir. I'm from New Jersey. I ride. I'm an armed chronic

[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.300]
You used to call me we need box, but then I found a life and I moved to New Jersey. Uh-huh

[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:08.420]
Uh-huh. I don't tell you what. Are you in a city? Are you just like a generic New Jersey? Like I was in the middle land

[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.880]
Oh the middle land giant stadium there

[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.780]
Well, I think more of the racetrack myself, but what do you say? I should have said uh-huh

[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:19.160]
And this is the first time I've witnessed sports up here. Yes. I'll tell you what

[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.820]
High thing it would not get away with anything up here

[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.940]
Life you get to weigh it down there. Yeah, you can't buy a ticket to a sporting event here. Uh-huh. What happens?

[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.560]
It's impossible. It's a giant for playing you know our way. Well the giant

[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.480]
I'll tell you one thing the giants maybe we'll go about the devils. What are all those empty seats that I see? Yes

[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.040]
They only had six thousand year right

[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:45.200]
Like the rain nothing like a Carolina thing. Ponds of empty seats in the devils of course have a pretty good team

[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.960]
Although not too good start, but nevertheless they got a lot of talent on it

[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.920]
Tons of empty seats I see. Yeah, that is true

[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:56.760]
You know what I noticed about the World Series. Yeah, you know even with the mess in the Yankees as soon as the seasons over

[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.000]
They think how can we find these guys again

[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.100]
You know the mess they gave pizza man

[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.560]
I want to tell you something. I'm gonna say it again

[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:12.480]
What they have just done giving our lighter eight million dollars a year four years 32 million dollars and 91 million dollars to the pizza man

[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.840]
That's the end they can take their baseballs that you shove them in their ass and I have no

[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.740]
It's whatsoever now. I got to pay eighty seven dollars for a hot dog when I go there you go

[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.120]
Um, can you come so many food spec please?

[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.300]
I'm closing. Yes. I got two two people it's gonna be quick

[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.960]
Keep million and Brian honey get drinking Jordan you are major food spec

[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.860]
Okay, I'll thank you. I can say it. Okay. Don't forget

[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:40.880]
We have an open-line in Broward five six seven oh five sixty that's only in Camden. Okay, and Trenton

[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:46.220]
Yeah, you're right. I guess you got a point. I'll find those books in the other in the tenify. Well, yeah, no, there you go

[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.020]
Here's the cross-spring. Hello

[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:50.800]
In the Leon

[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:57.180]
Am I on? Yeah, I'm on how about you? It's time you are yeah, it's a two thing first of all sportsman's down here

[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.060]
So thick old, you know, I think you can go by with whatever you want

[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:06.020]
I'm from Chicago and we support winning and losing teams. It's an event. Yeah, here people just they go to the games

[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.300]
It's like we can give your world through your team and we can take them away

[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.120]
We can take the money away. It's a big job. Yeah, well

[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:19.400]
Okay, but how can you not send a message to the guy? How could how could they average 20,000 people again for the marlins this last year

[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:24.600]
When he turned them into a little league team? How could anybody pay to see that crap and I get a guy call me two days ago

[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.620]
He's like some old fart. He's debating well

[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.400]
He got his renewal form in the mail and should he send it in and is John and we go to buy the team?

[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:37.160]
How could anybody renew for that crap after they slap you a silly and then drain the blood out of you?

[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.060]
Could he know it's just a mentality the mentality is you know, we got to go see some sort of sport on here

[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.500]
They're put up like you said watching little league. It's more enjoyable

[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.720]
And you know you got to stay off the path of the cold. That's probably the only routine that was at the team

[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.300]
Well, that's a pretty sad comment isn't it then it's a truth but a good point. Okay. Have a great day pal

[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.660]
I thought that that tappy what do they call that thing there in between periods the old pub pull there etc

[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.960]
I thought that was about the only entertaining thing when Diffle was out there. They were pulling it

[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.660]
Okay, it's 1147 at 560 WQM. We have an open line in date if you move quickly

[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.960]
560 560 pump

[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.360]
Here's Pompano Beach hello

[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:19.080]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Uh, yes, here's my first time at the new arena. Oh my god. I'm sorry. I apologize for fuselage

[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.700]
It gets worse. Uh, it's kind of a complaint

[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.860]
Have you ever been to the emerald room in your arena?

[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.920]
I don't know the elevator. He asked the elevator guy to take us to the emerald club

[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.960]
So the guy is trying to find the button out where to go and and the guy in the club to the elevator guy

[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:36.880]
You know what for time he's like I think it's on this one he goes well before you think he goes

[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.960]
I want you to refer to your handbook first and find out where it's at

[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.580]
So you make the right decision so we don't hold up the customers. Yeah

[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.040]
So he gets us to this week level and we're walking all around for the old elevator guy for not looking at it

[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:48.460]
Yeah

[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.780]
So anyway, we just by that time the game was just about to start so we went back to our seats

[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.820]
But it was terrible experience that was like no, you're you got it wrong

[00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.320]
If you would have been a lot luckier if it would have taken the god back to see the game that you had been heaven

[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.900]
That's true. You're right. He's got a nice little tour of the whole joint and the comeback said

[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:08.260]
I miss anything you'd looked up the scoreboard it would sit six nothing you said okay. See you. You're right

[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.120]
Well anyway, we did get back to our feet. Well exactly abortion

[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:16.680]
So other than that though the arena was nice. Yeah, it looks pretty good. Okay. Thank you. I mean had a good time. Thank you

[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.240]
Here's another happy camper

[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.340]
Little teeny tiny gold lights and sometimes they score gold that comes on sometimes it don't come on

[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.880]
Because Wayne don't want to spend a few more bucks to put real gold lights in air plus

[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.400]
I mean why should we bother because we don't screw any goals anyway

[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.320]
Let's see now. We're we're seeing three home games a scored one against L.A

[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.220]
None against Vancouver in two last night. That's three and three games sounds like one a game to me

[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.260]
Opposition scored one and five is six and seven games not too bad

[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.200]
You want

[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.040]
And we had for quite a lot of three shots on goal the first period. What are you complaining about? What's wrong with that?

[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.340]
Here's Miami. Hello

[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.500]
For now. Yes sir after

[00:17:59.260 --> 00:17:59.640]
Yeah

[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.860]
Okay, that was a while short and sweet right in the point to which we can only say uh sure

[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.120]
Two open lines and date five finalists line see like I said before

[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.540]
Just like the thing with the marlins that I'm not gonna keep beating this every day after last night

[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.180]
If you have nothing to say if you are I'm not saying that you got to stay away

[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.460]
You got a boycott you got to have it a risk breakdown. It's just a game but

[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.860]
If you don't even have anything to say for free

[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:28.840]
If you're not gonna open up a mouth and make a comment then you know something you got nothing to complain about

[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.180]
I'm not gonna do everybody else's screaming and carrying on form. Let's hear it

[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.860]
19,132 people air last night

[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:45.240]
So let's take out the 15 hundred or two thousand red wing fans. Let's talk about 17,000 alleged panther fans

[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.780]
Somebody paid for those tickets even if you didn't

[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.600]
Anybody please with that performance. No anybody

[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.620]
Ever want to see that again. No, but I'm afraid you will

[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.400]
You've got a disorganized mishmash of

[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:08.720]
Nothing is what you got you got a few guys out there even my good friend Paul laws who generally speaking is pretty solid

[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.160]
He was confident up last night like he had the

[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:12.480]
Woothing cough

[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:18.620]
Everybody it was like Christmas time early. Here's another gift for you see if you can stick this one at all

[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.060]
It's already in there. Why it's not on but it's in there

[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.320]
North Miami

[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:34.320]
And I kind of made a decision this week. I just spent $52

[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:42.460]
Which is what I would have mattered to us tomorrow night. I'm sitting

[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.800]
And I'll see what I guess

[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.080]
And have a good time. Let me know how it was all right. Okay

[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.440]
Well, there's a guy's gonna go down the C.D. Matador's in a mine which may be mounted minor league

[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.600]
But he might get least made a major league effort which we sure didn't do last night

[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.920]
I mean not even an effort not even anything just a grotesque we're standing around we're lost

[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:05.320]
We got no direction. We have no idea what the hell we're doing out here. Can anybody help us out? No, sorry

[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.540]
Open line and dates line

[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.180]
Here's a lady in deer field. Hello

[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:16.900]
Hey, Neil. Yes, ma'am. I would like to congratulate you for having some breath to put in a blame where the blame is due

[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:20.380]
Yes, the Murray brothers abiting Kissello. Give me a break

[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.380]
Frickin freck. You know what they do

[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.120]
They're sitting on their hands not doing anything

[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.560]
Something all right. They've destroyed this franchise Brian's been doing it for a couple of years now

[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.220]
And his brother came in here to bring a partner in crime. Well look what he's saying. They did to the Marlons

[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.400]
Yeah, the defending world-series

[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.340]
But but let me say it to you again

[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.160]
Let me say it to and this is the sports station all summer long

[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.160]
Not just on this show, which is really a sports show

[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.800]
But on this whole radio station there was almost no conversation by the caller's anybody screaming complaining

[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.440]
Bully again if this would go on in a real sports town, which this is not the people would be

[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:00.000]
I mean very how much does it cost to make a phone call and say I'm as mad as hell and I'm sick and tired

[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.360]
I'm disgusting and this is crap and you keep bleeding the money out of us and asking for more and more into our

[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.860]
Wieners and new stadium and this is the garbage you expect us to pay to go see

[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.880]
Thank you. I have I did not buy tickets this year season tickets

[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.040]
I have been a season ticket holder for the cancer since the beginning. Okay last year. I was

[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:23.460]
Just I was living. I can't believe I go to the games. I spent a hundred bucks that I worked for yeah

[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:29.280]
You know to see them lose constantly. I mean I'm gonna tell you right now last night was not by in Friday night

[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.380]
Okay, these are the last two home games by any stretch of the imagination entertainment

[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.200]
I don't care what you want to call it besides crap

[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:41.800]
But it was not in any way entertainment so the price that you pay for those tickets and for the parking and

[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:46.780]
Refreshments and all the other crap what it was for I have got no idea unless that we just got to make Wien all the money back

[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:54.100]
He lost in the Miami area. Well, you know, Wieny any to Ben Tim yeah, okay. I'm tired of his little wine any breaks the nail

[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:59.320]
He's out for six weeks. Oh, give me a break. He's a hockey player. No, I think you got that wrong

[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.280]
Okay, sweetheart good luck. Thank you

[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.540]
Open line and date one and proud these phones ought to be smoking here today

[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.800]
This is the day to get out of your goddamn system. Are they gonna do it? No, they're not because they sit back on her hand

[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.400]
In addition, which like I said you go there any night you go there the next time and it's a whole different crowd

[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.380]
Because there may be a couple of thousand of us who are real fans and the rest of it well

[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:26.560]
We got corporate seats from this one or we scout them out on the street. It's it's like a changing who are these people

[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.920]
You'll never see a whole bunch of the same faces any two games in a row and ad joint

[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.060]
That's that's the business. That's why there's no passion

[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.120]
Because they priced most of you people out of it

[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:44.820]
Who the hell knows right mine is gonna shell out five six grand to go see that crap and then sit in the corners during those little baby seats

[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.060]
They are they are at least had out of two but preparation nature of a game for the people are got to sit on the

[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.280]
On the turns there in those baby seats

[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.140]
To treat their goddamn

[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.320]
hemorrhoids

[00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.880]
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they start they start promoting with that no extra charge for the hemorrhoids

[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.200]
That's a bonus

[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.860]
You can pop a big one baby right there in the arena worried that is not a don't pop a bone

[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.520]
Hi my good-close personal friend Chuck Alfie Erie

[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:20.540]
But I station for the 90s happy Thursday to here. We have an open line in Brown if you do because we're used to it five six seven

[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.480]
Here's a mobile and sunrise. Hello

[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:33.560]
Neil yes, sir. I got a few things to feed back on the with the hockey game and the arena and everything else. Yes, I was listening for days and days and

[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.680]
First of all, I wanted to say before you made a comment that you never see the same faces

[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:46.580]
I we think how to present a hockey game and this is the 60 year of them doing it just because it's a different building the sound system

[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.340]
Were you there last night? Yes, I was did you hear the sound system before the game?

[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:54.940]
How the key is cutting out and then it comes on well, I mean at least they got the sound out to a

[00:23:54.940 --> 00:24:00.640]
livable level now thanks to me that's acting for that and at least they got to score even though it started red wings nothing

[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.700]
Panthers nothing then it was conundrums in panthers before they changed that I mean

[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:11.180]
They just haven't got a clue how to present a hockey game real team on the ice and I find that very sad and this thing with those goal lights

[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.000]
Maybe people think I'm nitpicking there. How do you make it?

[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.360]
Exciting if nobody if you could have seen after Detroit scored the fourth fourth goal at greasy goal

[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:24.780]
There and everybody is looking around a clue in the Detroit family. Are we supposed to cheer now? I mean what do we do now?

[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.880]
No goal light comes on because Wayne can't afford a new lightfall by guess

[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.380]
Well, I don't know about a porting. I think it's there isn't a lot of non-fairing

[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.380]
But you know it makes you wonder are they gonna?

[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:41.280]
A lot of people to think no matter where whose pocket is coming out of tourists or whoever

[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.820]
The public has built this stadium for this owner and for this team

[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.700]
I'll bet you 83 million dollars. They've got a they have an obligation

[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.900]
To make that place fan friendly to make that like to put on a good product out there

[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.740]
That at least is competitive. We're not saying we got to win a goddamn stand like up

[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:04.080]
But at least competitive it might have a chance to play out and they're not doing any of those things

[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.820]
And I did notice something new in the arena last night. They put up the uh the team flag

[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:15.580]
Him or a speed in over the blue line. Well, I was gonna make out a blazing shot as we were being embarrassed by all the Detroit fans

[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:20.220]
Chanting over the panthe fans. Yeah, we were busy sitting up looking at the sky praying for something

[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:25.720]
You know we didn't have to do it so we got to see the brand new flag they put up and they even had the

[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:31.280]
The Minnesota wild is up there ready to my only thing I kept screaming. Hey Terry don't buy a house

[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.680]
That was the only thing I kept screaming all night long

[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.380]
Well, good luck to us pal

[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.660]
Well, I was able to get through and let you hear it. Okay. I'll see you all right

[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:43.300]
Hey, how's Todd and Mike wow blow the following good. Let's face

[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:47.140]
Most of us will never be rich. Hell we probably won't even be successful

[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:52.440]
And that's pretty damn depressing but as usual with every problem there is a solution

[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.200]
Hi, I'm Jim and I'm here to tell you a little something about handguns

[00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.620]
They scared the shit out of people and intimidate them and then giving you whatever you want

[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.740]
That's right handguns

[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.520]
Think about it. Need some cash?

[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.580]
Rob a bank. Don't have enough money for fear all of the convenience store

[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:13.360]
Takes chips and pretzels wire and it's all free. You've got a handguns

[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.220]
Sunson of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend kill him

[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:23.160]
This simple solution of life's complex problems all I have to do is wait the five days for it and happiness is just around the corner

[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.880]
Now if you don't want to wait the five days who cares?

[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.380]
Buy the damn thing up the street just buy a lot of handguns

[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.700]
It's a great alternative to working problems out and get being considered a population control

[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.160]
Yes handguns they just might make your fans

[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.320]
Matador is returned from a two game trip

[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.600]
I'm here. There you go

[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.500]
The Matador swept the losing kings in the homes to a preseason meetings Jacksonville is all at a four on the season

[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:55.260]
So maybe we might even have a home team that wins tomorrow night the lizard kings and the Miami Matadors at the Miami Arena tomorrow night

[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.060]
Hey listen like the guy said before the price is right and they might even get an effort

[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.060]
We have an open line. Hello

[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.180]
Good afternoon, Neil. Yes, sir

[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:10.500]
Well, you failed you failed to mention the the only one that's Miami did have or Florida did have here to

[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.160]
At the new arena

[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:18.040]
You were mentioning all the goals we scored in the loss of that we have one win against Tampa Bayes of

[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.080]
We want we have the one win against Tampa Bayes. No, we get two wins

[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.180]
We have one win at home and then we won against an expansion. Okay. Thank you, sir

[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.400]
Please we got Florida Braggar rights there you go

[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.260]
I'm glad

[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.480]
Let me get my nose. Let me get my finger way up in there. Okay

[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.380]
There you go. There's a guy who finds it very amusing. Okay. It's just a game very funny

[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:41.260]
I guess very funny if you're not spending the money making any investment like so many of you people are like I said

[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.300]
I'm not paying for my tickets

[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.600]
Although if they won't buy me the tickets, um, you know, I would still pay I'd buy them

[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:51.640]
Because I'm a hockey nut. That's like a way of life to me. I would buy him is in and I would really be screaming

[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:57.060]
But I'm still screaming on behalf of these people because most of them, you know, the cascathard tongue

[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:05.280]
Last five games two tie a three ties and two losses very outstanding

[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.680]
By the way, it's effort to try none of the competitors so far but anything you're right home about

[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:16.060]
They haven't played the Dallas they haven't played the I mean not that there's any great. They haven't played the flyers

[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.280]
Oh, is that gonna be pretty huh?

[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.380]
Is that gonna be where do you have the schedule?

[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.100]
Where do we have it? I got it. I'm on a plate

[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.580]
One moment please that's gonna be a pretty tight to see huh

[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:28.780]
Whoo

[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:36.800]
That'll be a pretty thing to see when is that gonna come up the Philadelphia Flyers with John van Beesbrook

[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.620]
Oh, it's an away game. It's on Thursday, November 12

[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.640]
Right in the middle of my vacation dammit

[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.140]
But at home and I'll be back for this one baby

[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:53.780]
Sunday 6 p.m. November 22nd Philadelphia Flyers and the Bees uh Bees that will be here in town

[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:59.620]
Now unless something happens drastically between now and then with this organization

[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.060]
That could be a real ugly night, you know what I'm saying

[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.760]
You think there might be some people with some nifty motions out there that night

[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.580]
Bees are with that new mask that he's got nice mask by the way

[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:16.360]
Maybe that's what changed your luck around or maybe just getting out of here and getting away from the a of bm guy

[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.100]
Oh, it was all his fault. He was your bad guy. He was a stupid shimmy and

[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.200]
Here's the pember pine. So low. Oh

[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:25.840]
Yes, sir

[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:33.420]
Listen, I don't know if you caught it last night. I don't think you did because you were just left. Yeah, but uh they had you know there's

[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.440]
The best of the two other time you bet well they had

[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:45.140]
Just before at pfo introducing one of the segments there some some corny promotion

[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:49.220]
Jeff the forest. Yeah. Yeah, dfo they had it and you know the sitting

[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:56.100]
Ovation that you got you received when they put your foot up on the screen there right he got the exact opposite

[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.620]
I always boo him right off the ice they hate him like poison if they know he's an ass sucker

[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:05.080]
Yeah as much of an ass sucker is on football. Yeah, I think hating that much in the hockey arena

[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:11.600]
And one other thing he only comes across a little bit better though because he's got gildey sitting there in a morning on the show

[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:17.680]
So it lately it comes out. He's almost like critical, you know, but last year they remember those those spineless

[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.760]
Coaches shows and about the Christina Moore going in there and

[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:25.680]
Screen the calls and all that bull crap and vm like kind of censoring the show. They remember all of that

[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.220]
It was so horrible. I almost felt bad for the ass

[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:34.300]
They know who speaks out for the fans and they know who's just a organization but kisser listen one more request

[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:38.940]
Yes, as much as I appreciate you having them drop the levels on the music in between

[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:46.500]
I was wondering if maybe you could you could make an appointment with your foot and someone at the organization that yeah

[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:52.460]
Two I can get them to stop playing three four five songs after they drop the puck. Yeah, that would be nice

[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:56.180]
You're good point. I appreciate it. After we get the goalites straight now we'll work on that

[00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:00.820]
Have a good day. I'll never mention see every time of course when you're gonna play a team and the other team is gonna score a lot of goals

[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:04.700]
You don't want to put the goal light on every goal because then you're starting to spend a lot of electricity

[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:10.760]
Never thought about that. You know caught what does it cost like maybe half a cent to turn that goal light on for like 10 15 seconds

[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.900]
That's all stays on

[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:18.580]
Two games in a row go light doesn't what not because the goal judge missed the goal. I don't I don't think

[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.440]
And of course we don't have like the little boots where the goal judge sits in like a real hockey arena

[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.860]
We didn't bother putting those in there either because a lot of oversights were made because the people who designed this place were interested

[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.560]
I guess in architecture and not anything having to do with the game which is gonna be played in there

[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:37.480]
Are they gonna be playing basketball in there? No, they're gonna be playing that other gonna eventually play indoor

[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.040]
Bullcapped arena football and who knows what else in there inside crap

[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:46.440]
But the main sport what that was built for was a hockey game. That's what that was built for that's what it's all a built

[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:51.700]
And you think the people that build it ever saw and allegedly they may they went on this tour

[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:55.340]
They saw the GM place in Vancouver. They saw the Molson Center in Philadelphia

[00:31:55.340 --> 00:32:00.200]
They saw the core state. Whatever they're calling now fill it up. They saw Airby God Dan, New Arena

[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.960]
And they took the best features and the best guy they my ideas and did they put them all together? No

[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.540]
The least Aaron forget only had a single national anthem got the words right nice going here

[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:20.840]
That was beautiful. I had to go for a game. I'll never forget that as long as I live

[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.820]
Open line and brown or first though. There's a pretty passive

[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:31.220]
They're not really there's no passion about this. I mean, they're not really pissed off there and then wing knows this

[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:36.600]
And I'm sure that those people are in the organization are all listening and they say oh well let that kneel scream and how are he's always doing it

[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.280]
They people don't sound really upset

[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.980]
They don't give a crap they we can put out the we can put out 400 pounds of dog

[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:47.760]
I'm a guy still still keeps sucking up because it's a nice new building. It's convenient and uh, where there you go

[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.140]
So maybe I'm out of maybe I'm out of line here today. You think so. Uh-huh. I'm out of line

[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.720]
But the hell are we bitching about for Christ's sake? You go there

[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.260]
Kills a couple of hours you go home and you watch a good game on TV. That's all

[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.440]
The hell you want you jackass. Sorry

[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.260]
I'm not seriously. I might as well talk to myself and like get this out of my system

[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:13.500]
Like in off the elevator down there. You know, hey have a nice day. Okay. Thank you. I will just say to yourself

[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.040]
Yeah, like one of these. That's right. We're like one of these

[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:20.000]
I

[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.320]
Here's a pember prime. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir

[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.100]
Neil

[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.140]
A little change of topic

[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:30.940]
Um, I wanted to express my anger and frustration. Yes, at the inefficiencies of

[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.980]
Unsentental customer service department. Okay. Go right ahead rip them and ask me

[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.200]
I have been like this is like the third week that I'm trying to subscribe to the newspaper

[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.120]
Where would you turn? Yeah, and those assholes

[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.820]
They send me my the charge. It's right on my credit card

[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:49.380]
I haven't seen the newspaper in the last three weeks. Yeah, I mean, I understand this is not Cuba

[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.080]
You know, but they don't have customer service

[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.320]
But I mean for

[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:58.000]
I mean, you know, you can customer service in Cuba when you call them making complaints make them right to your house

[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.180]
Yeah, I mean, I mean, it's like totally incompetence, you know, uh-huh

[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.480]
Oh, wanted you, you know, I guess if you could let those guys know, you know

[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.660]
To make you feel just a little bit better about it though. You haven't gotten to Sun Sentinel last three weeks

[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:11.220]
Yeah, you haven't missed a thing

[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:16.320]
But I mean, I mean what better is the hell than no, no, no, but I'm saying no nothing worse

[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.720]
But I'm just saying at least I can make you feel a little bit better knowing you missed nothing. Okay, okay

[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.680]
I hope you start getting it soon, but let but at least feel very comforted knowing you didn't miss a goddamn thing

[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:31.160]
Okay, good luck pal. Thank you. Let him have it give him a hell give him a like I said two little tips to the paper today

[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.840]
Dino he's gonna make the trip. Dino is not gonna make the trip

[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:40.620]
We don't know because it's the local yokeal newspapers with a bunch of kids running around pretending to be sports writers

[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.320]
Pretending to be columnist pretending to be adults

[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.460]
This is kitty core town this place

[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:52.420]
The whole media here 90% of the goddamn media is a bunch of little kids little stringers little inept

[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:57.240]
Preview-Beson Jackass is running around pretending to be adults like very jackass over there at the herald

[00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:58.840]
Make it up crap

[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.040]
But and like I said nobody demands any better if this is what the public accepts

[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:13.320]
They will continue raping this town and taking out their millions and millions of dollars in profit and laugh it all the way to the goddamn bank

[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:20.900]
Here's a lady in lauderdale lake. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. Hi here. This is Dora. Hi Dora

[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.860]
Oh, thank you so much Dora that the chicken was really special

[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.220]
I mean the propeller's great, but the chicken. Oh, that was that was great

[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.600]
That's why I feel so good today

[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.800]
I've got all of my sins out of my sif and that chicken don't look too good anymore

[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:41.420]
But wow I feel great. Maybe you should pass it on yeah, well, I have to probably clean it up a little bit first

[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:48.820]
Oh, well, I have a bosey party coming up in somebody asked me where I want to go and I think to the arena

[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.440]
Uh-huh. So Saturday I'm gonna go to the devil

[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:58.300]
Yeah, I think for the devil or what? No, don't do that. Okay, the devil's Jesus. Well, I bet an exorcism if you do that

[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:04.540]
I have another chicken hat. Maybe I swear that would be you that would fit right in with the ambience. There is perfect for it

[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:08.080]
All right, well, it's kind of a chicken. Oh, there's that anyway

[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:14.720]
I just wanted to tell you I thank you for all that you give to the community and I appreciate listening to your show every day

[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.960]
Yeah, surely bassy each your heart out sweetheart. It's needle in the propeller head. There you go

[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:32.520]
We have an open lot same old crap very very ameli mouth

[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:40.400]
You guys prove when I say every day of my life in this time you prove exactly what I said they give you whatever you'll sit back and take

[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.780]
Anybody who spent harder and money to be in that arena last night

[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:49.800]
I don't care if you were eating off the floor if it was so palatial that they were like labeling uh

[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.440]
Chocolate moose in your earlobe I don't care what that was

[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.480]
That was unacceptable and you deserve a refund, but you won't even open up a mouth and make a peep about it

[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.640]
That's the saddest part

[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:05.780]
Even Mr. Peepers even wallets cut. Oh, that's right. What am I talking about? They don't wait about the guy damn shuttle

[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.900]
That's what I keep hearing in my ear

[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:16.160]
Open line if I so we're gonna go through a hole you're this crap are you gonna just sit back and put up a bit because I'm not

[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.300]
I won't even talk about it anymore if that's what'll make you happy

[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.560]
I'll never even bring it up again because I can go I can be home in three minutes

[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.540]
In fact the earlier I leave there's no traffic getting out of there none

[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.080]
I can be a publisher a minute and a half

[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.880]
Getting my dog food in the diet soda

[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:40.980]
Here's West Palm Beach hello. You know, yes sir. How you doing? Great listen

[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:45.440]

I mentioned that nobody no response. Well, I already mentioned that he had two great goals the penguins first two goals

[00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:01.140]
They'd be calorie five to two and Marty struck you could have seen the Stevie isemen go it was like like a free

[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:06.100]
Sram like where everybody on the panties went into suspended animation and they just kind of stood there

[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:12.420]
You've seen those things and he and isemen of course is a full speed just skating down the ice the right around robert's

[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:17.220]
Goes in there flips it up in that like Kirkman claims not even there and it was like

[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.200]
Huh, what just happened there?

[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.980]
Watching them they were watching the other team play

[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:29.580]

[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.720]
This is not something that's important to them. They are mellow

[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:03.200]
They're very content to sit back. Hey Wayne you'll dish out whatever crap you want because these people like it lay

[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:03.880]
a little on baby

[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:09.120]
Little bit of chocolate marshmallow sauce whatever you got in the side just lay it on them. They love it

[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.900]
Some god damn nerve for me to come on here and get all bent out of shape

[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:15.920]
See him out there 20

[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.760]

The

[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:40.540]

[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.060]
It's down

[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:43.260]
everywhere

[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:47.580]
She found you on knees and she swallowed him down

[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.260]
The least that's rowing

[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.420]
The best dress was the snow

[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:57.700]
Well, it wasn't long before it fell over

[00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:01.220]
And the little intern had a terrible fast

[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.680]
He was a bower

[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.140]
The best dress was the snow

[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.260]
The best dress was the snow

[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.860]
And why could you ask me?

[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:18.920]
What was that?

[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.800]
Well, she takes conversations on the phone

[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.240]
And talking about a fearless phone

[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.940]
And when he came he had it in his hands

[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:32.500]
She said really far I gotta take the stand

[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.680]
And I'll let the world folks curious men

[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.260]
But for what I hear

[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:41.220]
I understand she was a gold wall

[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:44.980]
Good girl, good girl, good girl

[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:49.220]
Good girl, good girl

[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.580]
Oh, oh, oh

[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.220]
Oh, oh, oh

[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:57.900]
Oh, oh

[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:02.280]
Oh, oh, oh

[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.640]
At 30 o'clock, 5 to 60

[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:09.220]
the

[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:14.900]
all that keeps coming along over and over again I don't what the hell that's all about

[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.180]
every time I see a picture of old John Glenn every time they show that shot of the

[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:19.920]
shuttle sitting there

[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.580]
that sound just keeps coming back to mind again

[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:26.120]
what do you think that is all look at that there's all the astronauts this is

[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:26.980]
beforehand of course

[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:31.280]
they all got their kind of orange their reddish orange outfits on

[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.540]
except for John has got kind of a

[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:33.560]
brown bottom

[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:39.480]
here's a mobile in Hollywood hello how are you Neil okay sir listen I

[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:44.920]
close up the radio station before the season started they had a three season

[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.360]
I talk about the Panthers you know it was just before the season opened

[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:53.060]
and I just talked first they had yeah I think it I think it's Steve Goldstein

[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:57.420]
and they announced it and I think for them yeah I brought up the fact that this

[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.980]
team did nothing in the West season to improve the only thing they could say was

[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:05.740]
John Ben Veebo you know what I was told I was told first of all the beginning of the

[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:10.560]
mistake was was they fired the first coach they blame the clean last year and they

[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:14.580]
bring in the firemully and why Murray wasn't successful because

[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:19.000]
gone then please look for a detention to the team right in the locker room of

[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.180]
course the contract problem they said this team was got a win because of

[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.740]
Terry Murray I wonder how come how come to love you with John Ben Vee's

[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:30.240]
work is got 12 points and leads the conference and point that I know that he's

[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.640]
playing such a great golfer them up there I hung up with high blood pressure on

[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:40.060]
it yeah yeah they sucks up so bad and it's telling me that Terry Murray is going to take

[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:44.280]
this team and you go see and I think or he goes to whatever they miss Gary he

[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:48.100]
he's they would make the play a really totally young y'all they said that this

[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:52.660]
team is going to make the playoffs he's hot you am I you know why so you know

[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.120]
he's just a little suck old they you've got to understand he's on a way in

[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.400]
the payroll don't you understand he has a credibility none he'll

[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:02.660]
him the ocean of the range is currently out when I was 15 that's all on my

[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:07.360]
hockey fair yeah back in New York team is going nowhere they don't have any scoring

[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:11.740]
and Rob me to my ear he's got he's just like one shot again what quit this guy

[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:18.760]
yeah come on he's not come on yeah come on good luck pal okay still insisted

[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.280]
he's going to be good along with his offense miss it got this his other defense

[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:26.240]
he's got to go from the point he's okay say I look up for his we have an open

[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.940]
line in power at five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty I mean what can

[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:35.620]
you say I mean Friday they're season in the NFL how can you play a game that has

[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:39.960]
so much importance and have the game hanging in a balance on what are two

[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.920]
bad calls and then throw out the replay that was the dumbest thing that they ever

[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:47.640]
did you think they'll bring it back they eventually yeah after enough games

[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.040]
gets decided on bad calls eventually the time of getting the time of big game was

[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.820]
the worst when right on anything cut that touchdown pass yeah and they lost

[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:59.380]
the fish you lost to that call it lost how about the jet's lines playoff

[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.920]
game or not to play off at the last game of the regular season last year when

[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:07.140]
the the lines got a gift touchdown and the replay clearly showed either it was

[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:12.640]
out of balance all right it's not proud you'll need to officiating sucks oh

[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.380]
yeah man how long I got to tell you this big enough officiating to show you the

[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:21.180]
engine there's all these people with these people is on okay it's like I said if

[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:25.480]
you really need to try and it's fine but to our left the couple of seats down on

[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.320]
the road I've never seen these people before because it's like changing of the

[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.720]
guard different people are begin there's one guy with a panther jersey on his

[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:38.300]
friend is God a red winger is he okay okay whatever so after we get the third

[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:41.700]
consecutive penalty called on the Panthers and great is verbally so I think this is

[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:45.180]
the one where Slava Kuzlo got a stick in the face in the first period I mean a stick

[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:49.800]
right in the post it's a third straight penalty and now after they score the

[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.020]
goal very quickly these two guys and I don't understand it because the one is

[00:44:54.020 --> 00:45:01.220]
the post of the red wing fan okay and they're both going hey you're soft I thought to myself this is so

[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:09.120]
on being believable it's like it's like they got a few expressions and that's it

[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:12.820]
that that's the breadth of their knowledge and every single one of those calls was

[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:18.720]
you couldn't possibly not make them they were flagrant penalties that we deserve so

[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.560]
it must have been the referees fault that we stunted you and I didn't give up all

[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:24.200]
those rules last night and could you could have given up about 20 if you could

[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.120]
have been on plan if they weren't playing tonight

[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:33.000]
hey ref you so finally they redeemed themselves on the other side in a second I might

[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.320]
bless you whoever you people were over there on the other side across the arena

[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:40.720]
who we all out hey Brian Murray you suck I was saying I was giving down a sitting

[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:50.400]
innovation the organization is the rain in Spain yeah we know all we didn't

[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.120]
win last night we didn't have Peter Rell in line up he's the a spark plug the

[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:59.280]
spark plug is it the spark plug the banana eating spark plug that's what Brian said

open line a day five there's us here's Delray Beach hello Nail yes sir I got a

[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:18.100]

[00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:29.290]
probably give it a more or less stick well you got to have something to come

[00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:35.190]
somebody with huh and by the end let me say this in all seriousness this guy's

[00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:39.330]
not a real fighter this this a bunch of pansy so-called fans who think that

[00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:42.550]
that guy's a fighter they're in La La land he's not a fighter he's just a big

[00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:46.230]
goon that's with the G big goon I think he's just in there cuz I know Lachy P

[00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:50.450]
wants more shouts and I just in there because see that's a diversion from the

[00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:53.670]
crappy play of the rest of the like at the end of that Hoover game I've gotten

[00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:56.690]

[00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:03.290]
embarrassed shot out five nothing we played a grotesque game that night Friday

[00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:07.330]
and is is that gonna convince anybody of anything that we get we got some big

[00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:10.090]
goon out there that's gonna start a bunch of meaningless fights and get some

[00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:14.330]
stupid penalties what the hell does that prove nothing okay pal one more thing

[00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:18.470]
Nail yes sir I try you talking about people having jerseys on I talked to

[00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:22.730]
one with a Chris Wells jersey you saw somebody at the game with a

[00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:28.010]
Craig well you know something at least he didn't hurt us last night something

[00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:32.250]
to think about I do thanks for the good Chris Wells anybody seen him lately no he's

[00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:35.350]
got another night or another week I mean I don't wish it he's a nice kid

[00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:40.390]
everybody tells me he's a good guy never stole 14 freight trains but I mean

[00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:43.350]
there's one of the worst trades in the history of all professional sports that

[00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:49.290]
they they're on they just they attack me viciously oh near Rogers doesn't know

[00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:52.110]
what he's talking about he's just stirring up a lot of trouble he's just

[00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:57.430]
trying to get right one thing I know I may not know anything else okay in a

[00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:02.230]
whole world I may know nothing but when it comes to hockey baby I know my

[00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:08.630]
that's right what I saw last night was pure crap right and that trade that's

[00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:12.310]
stew in the willy and all that that was total crap and giving away Marty

[00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:16.110]
struck that that's right and now destroying Ray let me say it again in case you

[00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:23.010]
missed the beginning of the show I know for a fact that Terry Murray doesn't

[00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:28.510]
like Ray Whitney as a player and even though he put them out there on the second

[00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:31.650]
line last night anyway in fact he had two shifts back to back which I thought it

[00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:35.250]
was a bending over backward to give him a chance to fail basically he played good

[00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:40.230]
last night he made some chances but nevertheless he don't like him so you can

[00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:43.990]
already get prepared put away all your Ray Whitney souvenirs and all your

[00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:47.390]
jerseys and memorabilia because even though he was the best player on a team last

[00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:50.470]
year he's the Terry Murray will do everything in his power to make sure that he

[00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:56.970]
fails so we can say told you so we got to get rid of him here's Miami Beach

[00:50:56.970 --> 00:51:04.350]
hello yeah huh right open line of day five six seven okay see on the elevator

[00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:08.950]
fell five six seven oh five sixty and pop five sixty at a mobile one line here's

[00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:13.650]
the lady in plantation hello hi Neil yes man I wanted to let you know that we went

[00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:18.830]
to our first game at the arena last oh my god I'm so sorry no you want to know

[00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:23.910]
something yeah we had a good time really well first of all I know the place is

[00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:27.250]
beautiful I mean it reminded me of an airport oh wait a minute they're testing

[00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:30.870]
the space shuttle it's gonna go up and let's go now with the one second okay

[00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:37.650]
well said all that yeah we I'll say the truth we went last night to watch the

[00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:42.510]
Stanley Cup winners play you know we because they're great team yeah and we went

[00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:46.770]
to watch and it was really we enjoyed it because we they were playing good hockey

[00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:51.770]
and uh we'll go we know it's a good way we'll go when you say they were playing

[00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:56.830]
good hockey yeah they played a good game based on the fact that he scored a lot of

[00:51:56.830 --> 00:52:00.990]
goals but when there's no opposition yeah standing around or watching them how

[00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:05.370]
can that been enjoyable experience well I guess I mean are you a Detroit are you

[00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:10.390]
from Detroit yeah I'm from Pittsburgh yeah I'm not I'm not from Detroit but we we

[00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:14.850]
went the reason we went to the game was because Detroit was playing I see okay but

[00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:19.710]
um that my case my point is that you know we're gonna go to the games because we

[00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:23.170]
want to see certain teams play not because the answers because the answers are

[00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:29.710]
worth going to yeah I would agree with that and um I bet but isn't that a said

[00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:33.670]
commentary I mean that's I think people go to games to see the team that's

[00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:36.990]
coming in and if it is another practice team oh we don't want to go see them you

[00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:40.010]
know what you want to go see the San Luis Rams there's 10,000 empty seats at

[00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:44.630]
it all and they could have to see that they could play no like when the wing when the

[00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:50.030]
wing the red wings were a scoring last night I know I want I want to see a good game I

[00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:53.350]
want to see a good competitive game and of course I would prefer that my team you know

[00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:56.950]
won again but I'd like to at least see a good game did I see a good game on Wednesday

[00:52:56.950 --> 00:53:00.710]
against the Kings no do I see a good game against Vancouver Friday no I see a good

[00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:06.290]
game last night by the Panther that competitive game no not at all I saw crap I saw

[00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:13.070]
two and a half hours of pure that's right I'm glad you had a good time we did okay see you

[00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:16.850]
all right people were you know with the Red Wing jerseys on some of whom are real

[00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:22.090]
Red Wing fans and some were just for our winning 40s they had a good time but those of

[00:53:22.090 --> 00:53:25.770]
us who are Panther fans most of the time except underfoot in the Leafs by the way oh would

[00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:31.930]
that be something huh I'm I'm already looking my chops waiting for those games later on

[00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:38.210]
here's Evan sure hello hello Neil yes sir yeah it's funny that you had mentioned I think about the

[00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:44.990]
infrared that infrared devices in the bathroom we we were talking about that last night how you know

[00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:49.530]
I mean I had the only one that's lived in the 20th century and they had a last night I mean

[00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:53.230]
it's a brand new arena they just spent 200 million dollars of our taxpayer money to build that

[00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:58.710]
exactly no no we were talking about that last night because like you say when you see a new building

[00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:07.590]
these days with the old style anyhow not to be the dead Panther here but yeah that's the first

[00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:14.130]
five minutes of the game Kirk Muller had two chances that most guys would give their left knuck for okay

[00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:19.710]
right in all alone within within eight feet of the net and he shot both of them five feet wide okay

[00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:23.490]
I mean I'm not gonna it's certainly not a lack of effort because he does make an effort out there

[00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:27.530]
but this guy don't have it anymore he didn't have it last year he's not getting any

[00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:32.010]
angry sure as hell don't have it this year and they would they would give anything to be able to

[00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:35.110]
trade him and nobody wants him and especially at the price they're paying him for three years

[00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:40.070]
uh with with the way that I mean I hope that blowing spray was mind here but the way that's

[00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:44.550]
spastic and some of these other guys are playing defense why not playing Norton and partner maybe

[00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:49.210]
trying showcase model maybe somebody else I think you guys got the way how can you showcase guys

[00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:54.070]
when you're getting your brains beat out how can you showcase somebody well I mean last night yeah

[00:54:54.070 --> 00:55:00.170]
they might you know but of course they show you though that the head games that this man is playing

[00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:04.690]
you saw the evidence of how well that's working last night the whole team quit playing and Robert

[00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:10.250]
Sphala was in a coma now one now one time do I remember the Troy guy getting knocked on his back no

[00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:13.950]
there there was one hit there was one hit in the third period I forget who the hell

[00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:18.510]
I stood around like spectators and watched the troid basically do whatever the hell he

[00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:23.290]
I don't know if he tried to save Burke or show him up and I pull him out and put Kirkman

[00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:28.330]
claim to fire up the team like my keen and yeah right really worked didn't it have a great day

[00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:33.290]
yourself you too yeah that Terry boy he's the great shrink he's the head man he's playing with our

[00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:38.890]
brains I think he's playing with himself we have two open line open line three minutes till one

[00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:43.990]
on QA we've got the Jimmy Johnson show on with Hank at five and we got Kimber Bull if you're not

[00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:52.030]
Q-A-M but Neil Roger show on her day welcome back now you hear 104 or 560 W-Q-A one of the

[00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:56.430]
worst columns in history of journalism by the way they use that word loosely Panthers get two

[00:55:56.430 --> 00:56:01.470]
thumbs down by Mike Burrardino in a Sunsendless morning so typical and of course keep in mind that

[00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:05.430]
the guys are right the column don't write the headline so the headlines you only think worth looking

[00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:10.410]
at and of course that's a right on target but the column says absolutely positively nothing except

[00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:14.970]
there was some guy impersonating Steven Spielberg in a crowd last night signing for new autographs

[00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:22.590]
and basically that's about it nice column Mike not I mean if we just had people in this town a

[00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:27.850]
newspaper columnist who could write who could say something who could write something who knew

[00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:32.410]
number one what he was writing about and number two could our articulate something that we would say

[00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:39.930]
yeah now you're talking baby do we have that here no got a bunch of overgrown children

an attitude oh let's go to a bokeh hello Neil yes sir how you doing great I thought that

[00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:39.890]
Steven Spubert guy on the screen last night that was pretty interesting my wife thought it was

[00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:44.450]
him I said no way would he come to a panther yeah you know what I mean he's not that crazy no way

[00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:48.910]
unbelievable he team might have been there but I done it he was somewhere I move on the ice

[00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:53.370]
yeah I think he was planned for us in the night you learned how to fry but um I'm figuring

[00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:58.150]
with this space shot I think it's as thing goes up pretty well you send most of the people down

[00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:02.170]
here up there yeah we can't get out here because that most of the tamarack up there right or

[00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:08.330]
there's a little grenade in the back no uh-huh yeah they got they'll drop a little bomb in the back

just stood it out of there yeah of course quarters to school I pulled my jersey over my head

[00:59:22.810 --> 00:59:26.450]
and stood up and pulled my hands up yeah I think this could be the year for the bag

[00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:30.790]
consent I would imagine by the middle of December at the latest you're going to be doing the bag

[00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:35.090]
over the head routine and I'll say one thing if there wasn't you I'd shoot six six six at my next

[00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:39.450]
meal would I cover up we have two open lives and Broward I'm a commandist community you're taking

[00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:49.650]
what's the point of getting your boy let me get hysterical okay that's what I get paid for

[00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:56.890]

[01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:08.550]
looking people in this one than the Miami arena all right just get out there in a food court

[01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:12.930]

[01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:21.650]
nine minutes after one that's what George says I'm not at all

[01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:51.670]
Bobby it's an effect that it's really a real big problem

[01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:56.070]

[01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:52.390]
I can here's Miami hello Neil yes sir I'm not a hockey player but why why all these

[01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:57.890]
frames go to this game why do they spend all their money that's it and then I have no idea

[01:01:57.890 --> 01:02:02.250]
of an accident for three hours and 15 minutes today and I have an answer so I have all these

[01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:05.850]
people that are putting on a horrendous performance they don't seem to care they have it only have no

[01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:10.970]
nothing else to do let's hear it for this god thank god for people like you sir that I want to

[01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:16.750]
think I and I I wish everybody could do the same thing yeah why not go into the panther yeah and

the model they both sons uh huh they don't come here okay for pleasure and the god bless you

[01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:26.810]
up and the boat you came in on I mean we have it open on us let it get ready up there in Daytona

[01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:33.370]
the Cape Canaveral all right any minute now they're going to send that old fart up in this

[01:02:33.370 --> 01:02:38.370]
place why sure hope they can't smell them on Uranus can you imagine they send him out there he's

[01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:42.110]
going to be cutting the bad ones loving others old people I start to lose control of their bodily

[01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:48.210]
functions you know when you get to be 177 like old John Glenn and of course they brought Walter

[01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:53.650]
Krunkite back out again anybody are happy about that no one thing I'll tell you about Walter he is old

[01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:59.890]
Walter Krunk he's got wrinkles on his wrinkles like Miss Lily and remember that he used to have

[01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:07.450]
wrinkles in places where was illegal in Jojo and here's Walter Krunkite is back out there and he's

[01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:12.110]
I mean what does that mean why is Walter Krunkite and you notice CNN supposedly pulled out this big

[01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:19.230]
cube because CBS didn't sign up to cover the sick CNN got him on me huh well they could afford

[01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:22.870]
to get him because they don't pay anybody else anything everybody works no people they're make

[01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:29.410]
nothing on that network buggoos and then that's why they had the big money remember they're

[01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:33.910]
going to try to hire Tom Burkaw away from NBC because they like guys with speech impediments

[01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:42.250]
here's hi Alia hello hello yes sir how you doing here okay you know it's good to hear someone who

[01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:49.410]
who actually talked talking instead of instead of just mentioning a corn then getting on the

[01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:55.210]
gate or talk yeah and uh well how can you talk about it on the morning show how can they talk about

[01:03:55.210 --> 01:04:01.530]

[01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:06.810]
you know where do you see the panthers going I mean what's wrong with where do I see them going yeah

[01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:12.070]
in the toilet I don't see them going there they're already there they they can't get any worse

[01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:16.350]
they cannot get any worse unless they totally unless they make a lot of deals and totally

[01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:20.870]
reshape this thing this season is lost I know it's only seven games in but I'm here to tell you

[01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:25.830]
right now this is a disaster team you think Brian Murray can pull it off yeah he's gonna he's

[01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:31.630]
pointing it right now good luck pal let me do it can Brian Murray pull it off can beat that

[01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:37.590]
gator meet we have an open line a day five sayers come on now every time that morning show then

[01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:41.250]

[01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:55.690]
the number for what's your goddamn beef but air me Thursday morning all of a sudden then their lines

[01:04:55.690 --> 01:05:00.250]
left because they're given a bunch of crap away and I learned a hard way given about your crap

[01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:05.070]
away is one hell of a sorry ass way and excuse to do a goddamn talk show even if it is in this town

[01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:09.990]
just remember that George because anybody gives stuff away on this show

[01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:18.030]
here's a mobile in adventure hello mobile in adventure hi Neil with speed yes

[01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:24.090]
the two bonds for more points less night than the panthers yes three you know that I'm not

[01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:28.790]
gonna talk about points yeah and so the young Murray on here yeah Brian Murray and the rest

[01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:34.450]
when he just saw some business yes sir that's how you right there what kind of person we're dealing

[01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:39.030]
with but yeah but you know something both brothers are the same only Terry Murray I'm fighting out

[01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:45.530]
now is a hard ass he's a bigger hard ass than Brian the telly says he's not a player coach yeah

[01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:50.270]
and we've noticed that because last night I guess it was no contact between the bench and the players

[01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:55.450]
they didn't but they didn't play for him a lick last night and I'm telling you that they will not

[01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:59.850]
play for him as long as he keeps trying to play these head games and blame guys who aren't responsible

[01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:03.290]
for the crap team that is brother put out there on the earth I mean how can you blame guys when

[01:06:03.290 --> 01:06:07.550]
they got nobody you want Victor Kuzlaw about there and Victor's got all these moves and he's

[01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:11.850]
the can like and he's doing it and and he has nobody to pass because he's got nobody out there playing

[01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:16.990]
with the guy can't go out there and do it by himself there has to be a supporting chance you have

[01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:20.990]
to have other guys out there who have skills and unfortunately because we got a bald headed chief

[01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:26.630]
bastard on the team we don't have those people we made no moves none right the six years ago

[01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:31.630]
or five years ago and the first season I would go to the games and I'd say well look at this team

[01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:36.130]
I think we're gonna get blown out we never got blown away this period all right here you go

[01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:41.190]
like I said for two okay thank you sir and congratulations there's a guy that he said one

[01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:45.290]
period he held his fingers over his nose like oh the stench accountant or his all of it is

[01:06:45.290 --> 01:06:51.790]
you and I'm getting out anybody that knocked anyone who left early last night needs mental help

[01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:55.550]
okay and like I said those of you who if you stayed to the bitter end must be because your car

[01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:59.790]
battery died or something like that are you waiting for a pizza delivery from outside the building

[01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:08.250]
because that was just on consumable so think that people are gonna pay that kind of money

[01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:13.350]
to see this garbage and and it ties right in with what I'm telling you with this piazza

[01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:17.610]
business and aliter business the sports mogul golly idiots all these dumb and little

[01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:25.390]
just who think that there's an unending supply of cash that they've earned I was just

[01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:28.710]
not hang one day last week driving home and he's absolutely right people are trying to say a

[01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:33.490]
baseball made a big comeback this year bullcraft there were three stories in baseball all really

[01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:38.630]
two stories the Yankees big year and and please don't tell me Cal Rip you nobody cared about that

[01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:43.470]
and the home one thing with sauce and McGuire that was it that was the only thing that boosted

[01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:47.150]
up for a while there because then when the world series came along the lowest ratings in history

[01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:54.290]
the lowest TV ratings ever so please die and here we got the NBA they're not even playing

[01:07:54.290 --> 01:08:01.710]
there not even close to any kind of agreement because of greed because these illiterate jackasses

[01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:08.770]
can't get enough I mean you look at these guys immediately you say to yourself dumb jack that's

[01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:17.270]
right but I've been in 20 million a year yeah right see in the slammers we'd art here's Kendall

[01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:23.230]
hello you know uh unfortunately I made a mistake you go into that game last night oh my god and uh

[01:08:23.230 --> 01:08:27.170]
you know I want to apologize to you so I'd be half of the whole organization I mean that was

[01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:32.510]
one of the games I picked I guess in my I guess I should just try to pick the uh ratty teams but you

[01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:35.630]
you're gonna pick your nose and add more fun than picking that game which you're thinking you say

[01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:40.130]
I haven't Toronto beat me Detroit a couple times okay they played him twice they beat him twice

[01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:45.770]
two one and five three yes sir and unfortunately I was stuck in a herd of red wing fans or whatever

[01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:50.830]
you want to call them because you know half of them are not even legit I mean that everyone's got

[01:08:50.830 --> 01:08:57.630]
two beers three beers four beers and I would say about a half maybe of the red wing jersey's last

[01:08:57.630 --> 01:09:02.010]
night were real Detroit fans who've been fans for a long time or maybe from Michigan whatever and the

[01:09:02.010 --> 01:09:06.210]
rest of them were just the usual front-running phonies wearing the jersey of whichever is the

[01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:11.410]
hottest team the last year we told that you got your Yankee jersey in your brother at home absolutely

[01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:16.990]
but I'll tell you what that was really my second trip to arena it was all the criticism the last

[01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:21.850]
few weeks I kind of took a better analization of it yes sir the seats kind of aren't small I

[01:09:21.850 --> 01:09:26.450]
didn't really notice for the first time but wait wait wait wait it depends on what seats you sit in

[01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:31.130]
okay it's on the look of the draw okay we're on all the same size like Venus is they're not all

[01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:36.750]
the same size okay well that'd be insane even when you I tried to go get something to eat yeah

[01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:40.930]
you got to wait on line for the whole period because they only got four food courts for the whole

[01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:44.870]
lower pool there they got 80 million people in there and I and I thought when he first gave me my

[01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:49.030]
guided tours I thought oh this is gonna be great what we're gonna have all of this at all and the

[01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:53.350]
meantime there's only four food courts for the whole goddamn lower part of the building which is

[01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:58.190]
where 90% of the people are and you can't even get your nuts you know those little plays nuts

[01:09:58.190 --> 01:10:01.870]
what happened to those never thought about that I haven't seen how the fuck can you go to a game

[01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:05.950]
without your nuts I think in fact you know something I must have been what was wrong with the panthers

[01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:09.030]
last night they all showed up without their nuts oh they showed up with no balls

[01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:13.830]
hey no no you know how I'm gonna ask yourself and I know you're a hot dog maybe

[01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:18.650]
how come nobody at least took an effort to put a body on somebody at any point in the game

[01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:24.030]
they were I mean not even let me say it against their read my lips because they will not

[01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:29.730]
play for this coach okay but there is no effort I mean I'm not not forget about playing a team

[01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:34.910]
that was a lot better than Blue was at everybody has that happened but I'm talking about a total

[01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:40.130]
lack of effort including that one mesmerizing period in the second period it seemed to last for five

[01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:45.510]
when they just just wandered around watching the red wing that full strength mind you're watching

[01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:49.910]
them pass it around I mean I thought Kirk McPain was gonna like run for the exit say give me

[01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:54.850]
another one right because you know if you're sitting there and getting shot like a rapist while you're

[01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:59.010]
saying Kirk McPain is a goalie who you know he's got his good days not too many of it but he

[01:10:59.010 --> 01:11:04.150]
he he's got a decent defense and he's got a supporting cast maybe he might get the job done

[01:11:04.150 --> 01:11:08.910]
on a certain day but when he's gotten nobody he's not the kind of guy who can compensate for no

[01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:13.710]
defense I agree with you and you know like you said there's this Kerry Murray I mean

[01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:19.010]
that's a he's the reason for the rules yeah exactly but you know if they're not gonna do anything

[01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:24.290]
now I mean even like this gold C80 the morning he's well if you know it's just a really was it

[01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:27.830]
I'm not saying it would change the game but it might have nothing would have changed

[01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:32.730]
well absolutely no he's got to put a fight on him I'm not you know you got at least I'm not

[01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:37.390]
talking the physical fighting part but you got to let them know they're coming your end you're

[01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:42.370]
gonna pay the price especially how about that one guy said why open in front of the net nobody's

[01:11:42.370 --> 01:11:47.410]

in poppano hello wow what was that two-a-a-things back to back you know what the world's most

[01:15:57.070 --> 01:16:01.530]
extensive battery is now meal and what is that so the one for the our philosophy bag for the

[01:16:01.530 --> 01:16:07.510]
head nurse make Mike my piata and L lighter 123 million dollars when that voice stands on a

[01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:13.890]
mound is that pathetic or what is it a most sickly thing I mean if sports wasn't going down a tube

[01:16:13.890 --> 01:16:20.190]
before that it is down now this is the final nail of the coffin and these owners are so stupid

[01:16:20.190 --> 01:16:23.630]
they don't even realize it on the one hand their belly and their screaming they're carrying on

[01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:28.410]
and the meantime they just they're just unleash any amount of money to try to buy a phony championship

[01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:33.370]
and then what the hell does it mean if they don't want it then you do if they don't put it

[01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:39.650]
happened in basketball and baseball like you've got in football they can take teams like this first

[01:16:39.650 --> 01:16:44.970]
Cincinnati Baltimore they can just throw them out and just make a four-lake team New York LA

[01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:49.810]
whatever another thing real quick if you happen to hear Hank freaking out on that

[01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:56.210]
Johnson Hessen commercial yet to that no you didn't hear him he was flumbolistic he was going to

[01:16:56.210 --> 01:17:01.930]
walk off the show up and play it on his airtime anymore he was I mean it was unbelievable

[01:17:01.930 --> 01:17:06.790]
listen I you know I don't know about Hank's deal but I have no no control over what recorded

[01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:11.670]
commercials they play on his show I'm not happy about it we got for some strange reason when

[01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:15.810]
I was on the other station all the liberal candidates had their spots on my show because it

[01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:19.690]
fitted with my audience and with the show but on this station because they don't really care

[01:17:19.690 --> 01:17:24.550]
they don't understand it I got every I got Lincoln D as Valar I got Charles the Heston shooter

[01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:29.210]
office and every right wing wacko that ever came down to fight running spots on this show

[01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:33.950]

[01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:39.170]
okay see if I'll open line and Broward two and eight five six seven oh five sixty and

[01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:46.530]
five five sixty on the AT&T wireless line that was the good Christian lady who likes the old

[01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:47.750]
first uh and the rest

[01:17:56.770 --> 01:18:08.430]
a young man turns twenty eight is Gordon sweet as bag I'll tell the next day

[01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:21.670]
it's too many seats in your dime bag getting due to party too many too late isn't it the chronic

[01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:32.910]
don't you think it's not great when you're falling break the free bag

[01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:36.010]
back when you'll see who is hey when you're already

[01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:40.130]
been counting out

[01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:40.130]

[01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:42.910]
okay let's not die

[01:18:44.610 --> 01:18:44.850]
I love th死

[01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:45.370]
you are useless

[01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:50.370]
cause

[01:18:50.890 --> 01:18:51.330]
drowning

[01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:54.230]
let's you already ate

[01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.850]
I know the honest

[01:18:56.850 --> 01:18:57.650]
dine

[01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:58.650]
oh

[01:18:58.650 --> 01:18:59.630]
a lot that you

[01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:00.230]
bury

[01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.550]
it's like

[01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:02.210]
tangy

[01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:09.170]
When all you need is a light, it's like having a feel of your dreams

[01:19:09.170 --> 01:19:12.030]
And then finding out you've lost and the light

[01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:17.810]
And there's only psychronics, don't you think?

[01:19:19.090 --> 01:19:24.350]
A little too much chronic, yeah I really think

[01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:32.690]
When you're glad to fall in the way, to free back

[01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:42.450]
When you're already there, to be sure that you have to give it a day

[01:19:42.450 --> 01:19:46.910]
And who I'll stop young again

[01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:54.930]
Oh my God, Walter Cronkart has got so bad that his head has sunk down to where his leg go

[01:19:54.930 --> 01:19:56.150]
He used to be, that's frightening

[01:19:57.070 --> 01:20:01.770]
16-2-5-60 WQM, so any minute now, any second

[01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:03.250]
What are you going to do?

[01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:04.410]
Who's that? Which one?

[01:20:04.730 --> 01:20:05.170]
Mr. Zimmer

[01:20:05.170 --> 01:20:07.650]
Oh Mr. Zimmer, DZMIS in North Miami, yes

[01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:09.770]
So apparently the calls have led off

[01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:11.670]
Oh yes, that wall hasn't he had a visit yet?

[01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:13.210]
Apparently not

[01:20:13.210 --> 01:20:14.110]
Well he will today

[01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:18.410]
Oh that's DZMIS who keeps the calling and making death threats to us and all over the building

[01:20:18.410 --> 01:20:19.630]
Now what did I do with this phone number?

[01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:23.850]
305-948-3914, so maybe you can call him and make a death threat to you

[01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:27.670]
Or you can make one to him whatever you like, because obviously you think the telephone is a play toy

[01:20:27.670 --> 01:20:30.050]
For scene now old parts, who will have no life

[01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:37.430]
305-948-3914, DZMIS and by the way, tomorrow after calls don't stop, we will give the address on the year 2

[01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:38.410]
Is a matter of fact

[01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:44.470]
Two open lines in date, 5-6-705-60 and 5-5-60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:46.210]
Here's Coral Gables, hello

[01:20:46.890 --> 01:20:47.290]
Neil

[01:20:47.290 --> 01:20:47.870]
Yes sir

[01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:48.850]
Are you doing? Okay

[01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:51.410]
You know I've been a big sports fan for years

[01:20:52.210 --> 01:20:55.230]
And I love to all sports, you've asked for a ball-based ball boxing

[01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:57.370]
Yeah, I've become so disgusted with sports

[01:20:57.370 --> 01:20:59.430]
Yeah, it's just not like it used to be

[01:21:00.130 --> 01:21:01.590]
You know, if you're in a joint thing

[01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:03.750]
If you took away the money today, there's nothing left

[01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:05.430]
You know what I mean? That's all it is

[01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:07.390]
That nobody cares about anything anymore

[01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:09.570]
You go out to that stupid hockey game last night

[01:21:09.570 --> 01:21:10.790]
There's nobody even making an effort

[01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:13.250]
Guys are getting paid a million, two million dollars a year

[01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:16.330]
They're just going through the motions and just give me a check, you know

[01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:17.430]
They're disgusted

[01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:19.370]
Anyway, I told you all I'd call the same

[01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:20.850]
I'm here, thank you

[01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:20.990]
Bye

[01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:22.370]
See you at the space show

[01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:24.810]
Let's go on the scene, we're gonna say the longs, that's what we want

[01:21:24.810 --> 01:21:26.310]
It's long time almost

[01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:28.710]
So I can't read, I mean, they're in a commercial break anyway

[01:21:28.710 --> 01:21:30.590]
But I'm gonna watch that thing out of the corner of my eye

[01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:32.730]
Because everybody in America is hanging on the edge

[01:21:32.730 --> 01:21:34.510]
That's why we got no calls in date right now

[01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:35.890]
They all landed their TV set

[01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:38.530]
They got to see this old fart go up in space

[01:21:38.530 --> 01:21:40.170]
Or if maybe it don't work out

[01:21:40.170 --> 01:21:42.010]
I keep, you know, I hate to say this

[01:21:42.010 --> 01:21:43.850]
Because it's getting very close to that time

[01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:47.150]
Let's just keep scrolling through my mind over and over again

[01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:50.250]
What a discovery, huh?

[01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:52.250]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 9

[01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:54.170]
The misfits and data are starting up again today

[01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:55.030]
There they go

[01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:56.550]
They can't control themselves

[01:21:57.550 --> 01:21:58.770]
Here's Fort Lauderdale, hello

[01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:01.290]
It's two things to say

[01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:01.790]
Yes sir

[01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:04.610]
And I've said it before, is this not a sports town?

[01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:04.930]
Yeah

[01:22:04.930 --> 01:22:06.530]
They don't get it

[01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:08.010]
Nail

[01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:08.710]
Yes?

[01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:10.190]
Can I call somebody to do something?

[01:22:10.330 --> 01:22:11.850]
No, not after that kind of material

[01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:13.690]
But you are right sir, it is not a sports town

[01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:16.290]
Because if it were, I mean, we had a lot of calls today

[01:22:16.290 --> 01:22:18.310]
But basically they're very fast in there

[01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:19.870]
It's almost like they don't give a crap

[01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:21.570]
And like I said before, and I'll say it again

[01:22:21.570 --> 01:22:24.090]
4, 5,000 times by the end of this month, no doubt

[01:22:24.090 --> 01:22:26.010]
That's why Wayne can get away with it

[01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:28.870]
Because the people are so apathetic and so indifferent

[01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:31.670]
In a real sports town, team wins the world championship

[01:22:31.670 --> 01:22:33.890]
And the owner comes in and the very next day says

[01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:35.590]
Oh, you know, you got to build a stadium

[01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:37.150]
Or we're not going to be able to afford to play

[01:22:37.150 --> 01:22:39.170]
And then you dismantle the whole goddamn team

[01:22:39.170 --> 01:22:41.250]
And a lot of people forget by the way

[01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:43.750]
That Kevin Brown and a couple other of the best players

[01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:45.310]
Offer last year championship team

[01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:48.810]
Had a meeting, had a private meeting that they asked for with Wayne

[01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:51.550]
And they said we would like to stay here

[01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.270]
We know we've got a great thing that we build here

[01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:55.570]
We'd like to work out, we'll even like maybe for a go

[01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:57.710]
Some of our salary or take a deferred payment

[01:22:57.710 --> 01:22:59.770]
We'll do anything and we'll work out a deal with it

[01:22:59.770 --> 01:23:01.650]
Is there any way we can do that? And Wayne said no

[01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:05.510]
Wayne basically stuck his foot right up each and every one of your rectum

[01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:06.230]
That's right

[01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:08.350]
And he still didn't care

[01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:11.490]
They're still calling about hey, what's the morning line

[01:23:11.490 --> 01:23:13.970]
And a volleyball game with a rhymed, equitent, bright and high

[01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:15.390]
That's what they're calling about

[01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:19.290]
Those are in sports fans, they're compulsive gamblers

[01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:22.670]
They're still talking hey, superbowl, superbowl

[01:23:22.670 --> 01:23:25.650]
Yeah, and you hear the comments that are made of quality

[01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:28.650]
Do you know what a pancake block is by the way?

[01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:32.210]
No, I've been watching football for 40 some years

[01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:34.490]
And even though I don't talk about it

[01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:36.630]
Because quite frankly it's gotten very boring in the caliber

[01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:37.570]
It's embarrassing

[01:23:37.570 --> 01:23:41.770]
But I have, guys call this morning about how come the dolphins

[01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:43.230]
Never throw a pancake block?

[01:23:44.290 --> 01:23:46.470]
Is that like a block party? Is that what that is?

[01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:48.670]
A pancake block

[01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:52.310]
42 years at least, I've been watching for 44 years

[01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:55.090]
I'm a watch the National Football League

[01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:58.650]
I've never heard a broadcaster, anybody calling a pancake block

[01:23:58.650 --> 01:24:00.910]
And I'm thinking, gee, I must be out of the loop

[01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:03.550]
I must be missing something over here

[01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:07.850]
How come Godly don't ever throw a pancake block?

[01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:10.190]
Well, gee, go over here, go to the old house of pancakes there

[01:24:10.190 --> 01:24:11.390]
And see maybe they got one pal

[01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:14.750]
Slap on right on, jam on it like she says

[01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:18.730]
Here's a mobile in Cooper City, hello

[01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:20.370]
Hi Neil, how are you?

[01:24:20.370 --> 01:24:20.970]
Okay, sir

[01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:23.290]
I got to the pancake block

[01:24:23.290 --> 01:24:25.030]
I didn't know until this year

[01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:26.650]
And my little boy plays

[01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:29.290]
There's six and a half plays, tackle football pancake block

[01:24:29.290 --> 01:24:32.210]
Is when you get your opponent, when you're blocking

[01:24:32.210 --> 01:24:34.210]
You get them on the ground and you lay on them

[01:24:34.210 --> 01:24:34.450]
Yeah

[01:24:34.450 --> 01:24:35.930]
That's what a pancake block is

[01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:38.790]
Well, wait a minute, you get your opponent on the ground and you lay on

[01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:39.670]
You know what that sounds like?

[01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:41.410]
That's a cake club you wore on

[01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:43.570]
Yeah, probably a fun only six and a half

[01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:43.970]
Okay

[01:24:43.970 --> 01:24:48.370]
And Neil, I'm surprised because you've been talking about the panther

[01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:49.990]
You're going nowhere this year all summer

[01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.590]
Yeah

[01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:53.350]
So what you're surprised about, but

[01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.910]
But we're not

[01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:55.770]
We knew this happened

[01:24:56.370 --> 01:24:57.290]
Yeah, you knew it

[01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:58.550]
You knew it was going to be this bad?

[01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:01.030]
Well, you predicted it

[01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:05.210]
And as far as the Marlins with their 20,000 picket sold

[01:25:05.210 --> 01:25:08.770]
Well, next year, do you really think all those season picket holders are going to pay?

[01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:11.370]
Well, I had 12,000 season picket holders

[01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:13.310]
But they averaged about 20,000 people again

[01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:16.250]
So that means that because most of the 12,000 season are corporate

[01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:17.090]
You know, that kind of stuff

[01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:21.510]
But that means that 8,000 other tickets on the average were sold for every game

[01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:24.910]
In spite of the fact that Wayne basically has stuck his foot up everybody's butt

[01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:26.710]
Well, I didn't buy the meal

[01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:31.850]
I'm, you know, revolving the pathway I can't send in my money

[01:25:31.850 --> 01:25:32.910]
They can take all these ports

[01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:35.130]
They can put them on their, on their, uh, rectum

[01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:35.550]
Right

[01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:36.730]
And get out of here

[01:25:36.730 --> 01:25:39.330]
And if you can adjust me, I just pass exactly to the airport

[01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:41.770]
And there's a space shuttle landing right now

[01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:44.410]
And there's a busload coming in from camera act in the market

[01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:47.590]
They're going to make you hurly bird at the cafe Uranus

[01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:48.730]
Oh, okay, pal

[01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:49.750]
Go John Glatt

[01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:51.410]
Get the philosophy bag concession

[01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:53.990]
Okay, I can't read that thing

[01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:58.450]
We did that on purpose, is it like stuck on 9 minutes and something or I can't read the numbers

[01:26:00.630 --> 01:26:02.010]
No, that's called a commercial

[01:26:04.290 --> 01:26:07.050]
That's called a commercial on CNN there, George is what that's called

[01:26:07.050 --> 01:26:08.330]
Make sure you want the same amount of thing

[01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:10.950]
Now we're on the same wavelength, it's all a bunch of crap

[01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:13.810]
That's the wavelength, baby

[01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:16.330]
Billions at dollars so we can send them all apart up there

[01:26:16.330 --> 01:26:17.670]
Because that's the least we can do for him

[01:26:17.670 --> 01:26:21.670]
If you're out there and you can't make ends meet, you can't pay your bills, you can't keep your electric cost

[01:26:21.670 --> 01:26:23.850]
You can't keep your God damn heat-blowing during the winter time

[01:26:23.850 --> 01:26:26.190]
Whatever your problem is, we can't be worried about you

[01:26:26.190 --> 01:26:29.950]
All the people are going to starve for death up north and freeze down homeless people

[01:26:29.950 --> 01:26:31.310]
We can't worry about them

[01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:34.750]
We don't have enough money for a disease research for all these diseases

[01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:36.030]
Kill them people all over the place

[01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:37.950]
Cancer and AIDS and whatever else it is

[01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:40.550]
tuberculosis that's coming back, we don't have enough money for that

[01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:45.150]
But we got endless supplies of money for all the crap that you can find for us

[01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:50.410]
And once upon a time, you know, this space program, you know, it's kind of like you have to wait

[01:26:50.410 --> 01:26:52.110]
The good against the bad, is it worth it or not

[01:26:52.110 --> 01:26:55.430]
And once upon a time there were a lot of new developments, technology, et cetera

[01:26:55.430 --> 01:27:01.210]
But I think at this stage of our lives, with all the problems in the world today

[01:27:02.010 --> 01:27:05.030]
With the world economies still I hate to break the news to you

[01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:08.490]
Going to hell in a hand-basket in Asia and in South America, a lot of other places

[01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:14.630]
The idea that this is supposed to be some kind of a goddamn celebration that we're supposed to be all assurred

[01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:16.970]
And about tells you a lot I've been telling you for months now

[01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:19.470]
The media is sick and they cut bad news

[01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:21.030]
That's right, let's dig up Old Water

[01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:23.990]
Cronkite, let's get all the old folks like this guy says

[01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:25.610]
Let's have an early bird dinner here

[01:27:26.230 --> 01:27:32.390]
Because we're sending a 70-70-year-old egotistical right-wing goddamn Republican posing as a Democrat from Ohio

[01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:34.230]
John Glenn up there in outer space

[01:27:36.490 --> 01:27:39.510]
He's a Democrat like I'm a born-again Christian, that's a kind of Democrat

[01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:44.470]
He is, he's nothing but another goddamn phony baloney chapter in phony American history

[01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:46.350]
He's much to do about nothing

[01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:51.450]
He's one of many guys who got on a goddamn spaceship and was lucky enough to come back alive

[01:27:51.450 --> 01:27:53.850]
How's that school teach you doing by the way by see her lately?

[01:27:54.250 --> 01:27:54.610]
No

[01:27:56.850 --> 01:27:58.670]
Eight minutes, still, the whole cabin

[01:27:59.870 --> 01:28:01.930]
Oh boy, I think they're gonna be in for a long time

[01:28:01.930 --> 01:28:04.570]
I got a facts here that is gonna make you psychotic

[01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:08.950]
Here is a guy who's obviously like a real living and reading business guy

[01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:12.830]
Because he sends me a facts on his business so let her head, Michael in poor Lauderdale

[01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:18.550]
He says, if I got something for you, this is about the national car rental arena, the Macarena

[01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:22.650]
I'm a seasoned ticket order for the Panthers and have been since the inaugural season

[01:28:22.650 --> 01:28:27.990]
Never have I been so insulted, not only is the food horrible to sound stings poor service but now

[01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:30.290]
There is a major parking problem

[01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.810]
Oi!

[01:28:31.710 --> 01:28:34.890]
With the opening of the new arena, I decided to purchase a parking pass

[01:28:34.890 --> 01:28:38.890]
Just like the new state of the outer arena being a ripoff, but now why did I buy a parking pass?

[01:28:39.150 --> 01:28:40.090]
And by the way, it wasn't cheap

[01:28:41.210 --> 01:28:41.930]
$500 plus

[01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:44.810]
I went to the game last night and there was no place to park

[01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:47.790]
No tendency to struck me to park on the side of the road

[01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:51.790]
I just like at least 20 other cars did just that

[01:28:52.730 --> 01:28:56.490]
That wasn't so bad, the loss of the game was bad, I left the game early with three minutes to go

[01:28:56.490 --> 01:28:58.510]
I walked over to where I parked my car

[01:28:58.510 --> 01:29:00.050]
It was Oi!

[01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.590]
Gone!

[01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:01.950]
Tode!

[01:29:02.690 --> 01:29:04.670]
I'm telling you it was Oi!

[01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.570]
Gone!

[01:29:05.970 --> 01:29:07.390]
It was f***ing gone

[01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:08.430]
I'm telling you

[01:29:09.770 --> 01:29:12.590]
I'm telling you, I asked the attendants what happened to my car

[01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:15.690]
They told me a lot of cars, all cars that were on the street

[01:29:15.690 --> 01:29:16.910]
They told me to park my car

[01:29:17.370 --> 01:29:18.030]
What is it?

[01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:21.450]
They told me to park my car there, my car was moved to a lot of cars to the street

[01:29:21.450 --> 01:29:24.830]
When I got to my car, it was a parking ticket, a $25 fine

[01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:26.990]
How dare they issue a ticket?

[01:29:27.130 --> 01:29:28.670]
I'm a seasoned ticket, order I have a parking pass

[01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:29.570]
And I get a ticket?

[01:29:29.770 --> 01:29:32.830]
Why would I park on a street for free and pay for a pass and not use it?

[01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:36.370]
The attendants told me there were spaces on the other side of the lot

[01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:37.670]
And they told me to go over there

[01:29:37.670 --> 01:29:40.890]
Oh, and this guy goes on and on and on

[01:29:40.890 --> 01:29:43.350]
Never received a ticket, Miami, etc. and so on

[01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:45.590]
This sucks, says Michael in Fort Lauderdale

[01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:48.330]
A business guy who has pissed off and fired up

[01:29:48.330 --> 01:29:51.270]
And thank God he got his facts to me before the end of the day today

[01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:53.950]
So not just the quality of the product that sucks

[01:29:53.950 --> 01:29:56.930]
It sucks would be a compliment, sucks would be a compliment

[01:29:56.930 --> 01:30:00.110]
When you go out there, I want to say this because I don't know if they've left town yet

[01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:01.510]
I don't know who knows whether they left or not

[01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:03.390]
But I'm going to tell you something new guys

[01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:07.410]
There were a couple of guys Victor and Whitney, a couple of guys that at least made an effort for us last night

[01:30:07.410 --> 01:30:09.970]
But the rest of you guys go into the motions like that

[01:30:09.970 --> 01:30:13.330]
Whether it's the Spite Terry Murray because he's an asshole

[01:30:13.330 --> 01:30:14.730]
Or whatever the reason might be

[01:30:14.730 --> 01:30:19.550]
People are paying their good, harder, and money to go see a sporting event

[01:30:20.150 --> 01:30:23.630]
Not to see a bunch of a bunch of floaters out there floating around

[01:30:23.630 --> 01:30:26.630]
I realize we don't have the talent that we need to really compete

[01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:33.390]
We got a bunch of old hacks that were desperate to get rid of like Kirk Muller and Terry Carcner and Jeff Norton and a bunch of other guys

[01:30:34.850 --> 01:30:36.810]
But at least make an effort, okay?

[01:30:37.150 --> 01:30:41.590]
At least try to put on a performance when 19,130 people are out there

[01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:44.550]
Paying their goddamn hard earned money, getting their cars thrown away

[01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:47.590]
Panned through the nose for a horse ball over price concessions

[01:30:48.450 --> 01:30:52.110]
Some people sitting in seats that are like baby seats for a goddamn minpin

[01:30:52.630 --> 01:30:57.930]
Yeah, I could take my little vlog of it and they got seats perfect for his little last 10 pounds if you're right in there I could grow
