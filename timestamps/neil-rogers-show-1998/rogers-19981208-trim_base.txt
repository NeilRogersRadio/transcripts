[00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.680]
567-0560-2303, Redeed and Broward.

[00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.800]
Or pound the show, do not necessarily reflect those of you.

[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.020]
Am.

[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.140]
Hi, this is Mari Povitch, wishing you a happy Hanukkah.

[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.080]
OK, how come we're going to start off the same way

[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.000]
we did yesterday again?

[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.640]
Did I hear nothing on the overhead, nothing on the monitor?

[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.700]
Are we going to start out with another technical problem

[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.300]
again today?

[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.120]
Like we did yesterday?

[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.020]
George?

[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.080]
They hear us fine.

[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.100]
They hear us fine.

[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.000]
How come I didn't hear anything when Mori Povitch

[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.260]
just did that number there?

[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.020]
Hi, this is Mari Povitch, wishing you a happy Hanukkah.

[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.400]
OK.

[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.120]
Hi, Neal.

[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.400]
I'm a Miami resident.

[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.460]
And I would just tap into here as a neo-pochzo in my way home.

[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.100]
And I think it's absolutely horrible.

[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.500]
And I haven't understand how anybody with values and morals

[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.800]
or social conscience can allow such a thing

[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.320]
to be broadcast on the station.

[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.940]
Oh, right.

[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.580]
This guy is just cursing at people insulting,

[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.960]
blasphemy, just spreading anger and hatred.

[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.480]
I don't understand that.

[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.360]
I mean, do you have children?

[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.460]
Do you have a family?

[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.880]
Do you care what's going on in the world?

[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.340]
No.

[00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.920]
But just this bad stuff should be going around.

[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.200]
Someone just venting all their hatred and anger at innocent people.

[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.840]
I mean, if you just let somebody crying on the sun, the air,

[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.180]
and maybe it's really popular and makes a lot of money

[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.920]
for your station.

[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.440]
But this is really not what the world means.

[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.260]
I mean, things are bad enough.

[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.060]
I don't think we need a guy like this.

[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.300]
And I really find it very offensive and just horrible.

[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.840]
I mean, how would you like if your children were listening

[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.740]
to that and glowing up in a world where

[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.360]
this kind of thing is acceptable?

[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.120]
Where people can talk like that and be paid for it and be endorsed?

[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.820]
I mean, I'm just horrified and disgusted.

[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.980]
Life freedom of speech, yeah.

[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.000]
And I'm sure I'm not the only person to feel that way.

[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.720]
Please try and take consideration of the rest of the world

[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.300]
and the other people that have to be.

[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.580]
Merry Christmas, happy Chinooka, and all the other good stuff,

[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.940]
all these other great holidays that have you all bustling

[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.200]
and running around like a bunch of ants.

[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.820]
So I mean, like a bunch of busy people.

[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.260]
Speaking of busy people, by the way,

[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.580]
all first I want to salute a fine young man.

[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.780]
I have no idea who he is.

[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.660]
I'll never see him again.

[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.320]
But he was stopped at the light on the corner of 441 and 199th.

[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.080]
Right by Chuck Subbs' matter of fact.

[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.600]
Yesterday I'm on the way home, getting ready to make my right turn.

[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.320]
And this young man is parked in front of me.

[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.520]
He looks in a mirror, he mirroring, sees that I'm behind him,

[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.080]
turns around, gives me a wave, and then starts like,

[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.200]
I'm going to tell you, I believe he was grabbing himself.

[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.560]
He was so excited to see me.

[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.460]
I'm just unbelievable.

[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.300]
Grabbing himself, slapping the steering wheel.

[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.060]
He was slapping everything inside and that too.

[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.460]
That's right.

[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.380]
So happy you're whatever to you, too, pal.

[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.340]
And speaking of drivers, by the way,

[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.660]
we've discovered something new in America

[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.940]
and that is that the roads are like a telephone booth.

[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.340]
Now that's right, everybody has got a cell phone.

[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.540]
AirBJEC, as including, see down here, we have about,

[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.220]
I would say, you know, I'll be generous,

[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.420]
about 70% of the people who shouldn't be on the road

[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.720]
under any circumstances, even on a perfectly sunny day,

[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.340]
a clear day with a dry road, minimal traffic,

[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.500]
like on a holiday, you know.

[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.880]
These people can barely function on that kind of a day.

[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.080]
Much less, you know, right now where everybody's on the roads,

[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.820]
it's congested, people are schlepping all over,

[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.040]
shopping, doing whatever they're doing.

[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.920]
And now AirBJEC has got a cell phone

[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.880]
stuck to his or her or its ear.

[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.820]
I'm at the, I'm at by a knob hill and

[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.460]
Broward Boulevard yesterday going home.

[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.780]
And there's a clown he's sitting there at the light.

[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.900]
He's in front of me at the traffic at the red light.

[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.920]
The light turns green.

[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.800]
Does he go?

[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.120]
No, no, he doesn't go.

[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.760]
And why?

[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.440]
Because he's got the cell phone stuck to his ear.

[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.420]
He's finishing the conversation, man.

[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.200]
He is finishing his conversation.

[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.640]
This was one of about a half a dozen people yesterday

[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.020]
that I encountered because I'm staring at notice it more

[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.180]
and more and more.

[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.700]
I mean, I don't mind if you're talking to somebody,

[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.960]
we get a million calls here every day on the cell phones.

[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.520]
That's fine.

[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.000]
But at least pay a little bit of attention to driving.

[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.220]
Maybe 5% would be good for starters.

[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.060]
And this guy, he like finishes the conversation.

[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.380]
And I, you know, give him a two to the horn.

[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.500]
Pays no attention.

[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.920]
Grabbed the phone away from his ear.

[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.840]
Because thank God, thank God he's finally finished

[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.480]
with a conversation.

[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.780]
I might still be sitting there now.

[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.020]
And he punches the thing off, puts the phone down.

[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.920]
And now all of a sudden, he grabs the wheel

[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.660]
and away he goes and we finally get through the light.

[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.300]
The roads are like a telephone booth in South Florida

[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.180]
because every jackass has got a phone stuck in his ear.

[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.060]
Jesus, man, it's just, it's a beautiful thing.

[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.940]
But let's not start out on that kind of a note.

[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.300]
Let's start out with a good news.

[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.120]
They got the, all the Islam machines

[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.360]
and their money and their perfinity back last night.

[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.700]
Oh!

[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.540]
It was on all the newscasts, the law.

[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.180]
You notice it didn't make the front page

[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.500]
of the newspapers today.

[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.980]
Kind of buried.

[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.560]
Here it is.

[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.860]
I got one of the whichever paper this is, the Herald.

[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.820]
I think this was buried either in the local

[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.680]
or the Bobby Butterworth and Sheriff Ken Jenning.

[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.720]
That's right.

[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.320]
Right before Christmas time, they go in their last week,

[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.160]
weighed the cruise ships, the one in particular,

[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.000]
the Sun Cruise 6, Yank all of those evil slot machines

[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.240]
off of their compass, gave hundreds and hundreds

[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.820]
and hundreds of thousands of dollars.

[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.220]
God only knows how much.

[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.760]
Oh, a million dollars it says.

[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.640]
And of course they had these little rinky tank,

[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.360]
a Kmart or a radio shack kind of pieces of equipment

[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.520]
in there to detect how far and they admitted,

[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.920]
well, we were really sure where the hell we were.

[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.660]
Maybe it was twang.

[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.820]
And of course, I want you to stop and think about this.

[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.120]
Is it exactly three miles outside the

[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.280]
territory of the border of Florida?

[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.780]
Is it 2.8 miles?

[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.980]
Is it 2.6?

[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.240]
Is it maybe 3.1?

[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.980]
Does anybody know?

[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.400]
And does it make any difference?

[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.400]
That's the point.

[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.300]
Talk about nitpicking.

[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.020]
Talk about spending since April, months and months and months

[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.340]
and got only knows how many thousands or millions of dollars

[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.880]
on this very, very important investigation

[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.560]
that blows up in their face once again.

[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.580]
But I mean, stop and think about how they're not only polluting

[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.560]
the waters of your sea life, all the fish.

[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.460]
I bet you even the dolphins out there are losing their morality

[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.560]
because the goddamn all that gambling is going on those cruise ships

[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.160]
inside the three mile limit.

[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.160]
Now if they're like three and a half miles out there,

[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.940]
then it's okay.

[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.940]
Then we don't have to worry about a goddamn thing.

[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.040]
But if they're only like 2.8, 2.9 miles,

[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.440]
if they're like within that three mile,

[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.240]
then of course something evil is going on.

[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.440]
We better do something about it.

[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.280]
That's what the Sun Sentinel said.

[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.560]
That's what Sheriff Ken Jenny says.

[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.820]
That's what Goodie Tushu's Bobby Butterworth says.

[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.540]
And this, you know, something just like these impeachment hearings

[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.000]
that are going on again right now, as I speak,

[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.860]
there's John Conn, he's a good man, he's speaking,

[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.460]
but I'll be credible, but about Samo Krap.

[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.840]
Thank God that the most important things that we got no crime,

[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.680]
we got no uneducated people running around,

[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.240]
we got no problems in America.

[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.360]
The only thing we have to worry about are cruise ships

[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.680]
that aren't going out there far enough.

[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.980]
And about, let's, you know,

[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.200]
presidents who are getting blow jobs.

[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.360]
Thank God for that.

[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.300]
You know, with this holiday time of year,

[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.600]
you know, we just finished with Thanksgiving.

[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.360]
There's more that we can be thankful for.

[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.420]
The fees are the important things that we have to address

[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.880]
that we can direct our attention to.

[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.200]
Man, things must be going pretty damn well.

[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.260]
Nine minutes after 10, it's five.

[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.300]
At least just one hour right there,

[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:23.180]
one minute after 4 pandemic,

[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.240]
at least three 40 days,

[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:25.840]
in 18 Exodus 5th,

[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.200]
at more than 14.7 million.

[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.240]

[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.240]

[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.260]
Oh my God.

[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:44.780]
Oh!

[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.020]
1015-560 WQA and your neurotic station for the holidays and for most of the year, by

[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.680]
the way, Joe DiMaggio is on the edge.

[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.020]
I don't want to get the Greg Cotex's day off to a bad start over there at the hero, because

[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.800]
I know that he believes that, you know, superstars never die.

[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.620]
That's right.

[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.640]
There are some people who are just too important that you never die, especially if they

[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.740]
were like jocks because Greg Cotex's a sports writer of sorts.

[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.580]
And I use that term loosely.

[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.000]
I better take this call from a van because I think, now, anybody have a heart or a liver?

[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.940]
These ball games, instead of buying 20 bucks with a food at that hockey game tomorrow

[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.260]
night and shoveling it into ball these pockets, even though we do know, of course, he's

[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.020]
going to give it to Chiric.

[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:29.500]
Oh yeah.

[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:29.800]
Right.

[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.080]
The Wayne Heisenga Foundation.

[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.620]
So that's what we're looking to know.

[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.040]
Well, Uncle Mel.

[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:38.660]
Yes, sir.

[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.780]
You are on a roll.

[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:40.580]
Yes, I am.

[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.220]
You are in a tantrum.

[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:42.720]
I'm rolling it.

[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.140]
I'm rolling it.

[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:43.960]
I'm rolling it.

[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.340]
Hey, I've got a couple of things.

[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.500]
This is Mark, first of all, a long time listener from your day to day.

[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.520]
A college group with you, college days and everything.

[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:54.900]
And survived it somehow.

[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.420]
Every time you made the trip, the journey a lot easier.

[00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.140]
Yes, I have.

[00:08:59.140 --> 00:08:59.140]

[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.000]
Number one.

[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:00.520]
And you're welcome.

[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.060]
Thank you very much.

[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.800]
Number one, the way you started that call with that lady, calling you on tape.

[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:07.420]
Oh yeah.

[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:15.720]
And as you listen to this garbage, this one, we have to listen to it for two seconds, lady,

[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.100]
if you don't like it, gut it off.

[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:17.420]
Okay.

[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.180]
People that do like it, they listen and anybody with a brain that doesn't like it, instead

[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.660]
of sitting there, oh my God.

[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.740]
Instead of being a Paul or professionally agitated, they turn it off and they find something

[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.160]
else to do.

[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.240]
But obviously there's something in that bitch in that nice lady that attracts her to

[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.520]
this, even though she doesn't want to admit it.

[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.180]
And she likes so many other people.

[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.740]
Once they discovered this show, she can't turn the thing off.

[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:37.300]
Absolutely.

[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.100]
So I found that kind of funny that she, you're right, I have heard it on your show when

[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.840]
you have the people, why do you listen?

[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:43.160]
Right.

[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.700]
And as far as I'm concerned, when I don't like something on this, I change the channel.

[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.160]
Exactly.

[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.040]
And then all the people with television now with your clickers, everybody's got to remote

[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.060]
and with cable and with satellite dishes, the small dish.

[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.680]
Everybody's got that clicker going.

[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.240]
I mean, I'm one of the worst offenders in the world.

[00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.680]
If I'm watching something and for more than 10 seconds or something on here, I don't like

[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.760]
her that doesn't interest me, I'm clicking at baby in the remote too.

[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:04.480]
That's right.

[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.820]
So that was kind of funny.

[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.340]
Let me see number two, the call from Havana Cuba, excellent.

[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.140]
Wasn't that simple?

[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:11.660]

[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.680]
If that guy called in every like week, I'd love to hear him.

[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.040]
Yeah.

[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.020]
He's got a lot of practice.

[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:18.860]
He's got his own show.

[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.640]
He's playing Pericomo Records or something now.

[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.220]
That is correct.

[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:21.780]
Mother Bull.

[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.620]
Yeah, that was funny.

[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:23.880]
Yeah.

[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.660]
That was funny.

[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.640]
Number three, those numbers three.

[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.440]
Well, first of all, I told George that he's great when you're on.

[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.120]
Why don't you be Kate?

[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:33.660]
Yes he is.

[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.600]
A lot better than Kate.

[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.140]
Mm-hmm.

[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.260]
And by the way, that was my idea.

[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.720]
I take all the credit in the world for that.

[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.400]
Okay, since I'm taking credit for stuff today.

[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:40.840]
Right.

[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.480]
Nice going, Neil.

[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:41.840]
Thank you.

[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:42.740]
Better than Kate.

[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.240]
Right.

[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:49.420]
And lastly, if you get a chance, do me a favor and I have not heard big girls remember

[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.220]
from the day to day?

[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.760]
Oh, big girl.

[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.360]
Big girl.

[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.280]
I love it.

[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.540]
I think I have to dig around for that.

[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.340]
I know I've got it somewhere.

[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.260]
It's not in the DC.

[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:57.960]
I've got it somewhere.

[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.640]
And love your show when you have a good holiday and I'll give you a call in a couple

[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:02.880]
of years.

[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.560]
And have a great life.

[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:03.880]
All right.

[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.860]
So, okay, there you go.

[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.580]
He somehow survived it since all the way by his own.

[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.640]
Warm and here is it just me.

[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.680]
It seems a little bit on the tepid side.

[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.080]
What is it?

[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:11.520]
I'll go visit.

[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.900]
It's a little on the Luke Warm side, if you ask me.

[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.420]
Oh, speaking of visit, there is an article very depressing, by the way, for those people

[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.340]
who believe we ought to have 200 states in the union.

[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.460]
Where the hell did it?

[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.300]
What did I do with that thing?

[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.260]
Damn it.

[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.640]
Got so much crap here today.

[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.600]
Where is that little piece?

[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.840]
Oh, here's that little piece.

[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.840]
Not enough support for statehood, Paul says.

[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.640]
Days before a vote on Puerto Rico's future relationship in the United States, a poll

[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.920]
shows support for U.S. statehood at only 37%.

[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.740]
For voting on it?

[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.960]
How the hell can they vote on it?

[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.940]
Why wouldn't we have to vote on it?

[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.560]
The survey published on Monday by the El Mundo newspaper, Echo's previous poll.

[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.200]
Similar surveys have shown statehood winning the most votes, but falling short of the

[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.440]
$50.

[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.900]
So why don't we have Puerto Rico?

[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.300]
We've got enough Puerto Ricans here already.

[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.520]
We love our Puerto Ricans friends, and there's a free switchblade with every Puerto

[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:56.800]
Ricans.

[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.420]
What's wrong with that?

[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.060]
So one of our poll questions today, who make the best neighbors?

[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.480]
Puerto Ricans, Colombians, or Cubans?

[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.540]
That's our poll question today.

[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.060]
What are you smiling about?

[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.760]
I think that's a very legitimate question.

[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.040]
Who would you rather have living next door to your house?

[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.160]
Now, there's probably going to be none of the above.

[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.840]
There'll be that category too, like in their poll.

[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.280]
Puerto Ricans, Colombians, or Cubans.

[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:25.040]
I think that's a very, very significant questionnaire and something we really ought to spend.

[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.360]
We ought to spend a lot more time thinking about that and about some stupid ballgame.

[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.100]
Hey, how'd the poll be in coffin, dude?

[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.360]
10.56.

[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:41.780]
This is the most disgusting program I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.620]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:10.960]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.040]

[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.040]

[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.040]

[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.040]

[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.040]

[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:11.600]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:29.780]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.740]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.060]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.560]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:11.540]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:11.540]

[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:11.540]

[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:11.540]

[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.520]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:05.020]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:05.080]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:05.080]

[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.660]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:36.640]
New South Asian 됐ee

[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.840]
ruptured Toronto and they said oh yeah if you want to hang your boobs out and march up

[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.780]
and down that's okay and now this Roman Catholic priest up there this bishop

[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:49.500]
Matthew Clark oh no he's not the one jibber James Cowan I'm sorry at the

[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.980]
Corpus Christi Church in Rochester in Europe he's the one that's been mirroring

[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:58.500]
gay people same sex weddings in Rochester of all places so somewhere along

[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.120]
the line yes Virginia there is a liberal element Rochester believe it or not

[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.320]
must be those Jews and Italians the Roman Catholic diocese on Monday

[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.860]
suspended a priest who conducted same sex weddings served holy communion to

[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.620]
non-Catholic like that and allowed a woman to perform some duties on the

[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:19.380]
altar okay which is another one of the parts of the lunacy of the Catholic

[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.160]
Church and most religions like Orthodox Jews

[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.480]
treated it because the Bible says you know that women are like just like your

[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.300]
slaves are like whatever the Bible said that's right it was all these

[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.300]
instructions so all you women just stayed barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen

[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.540]
and cut the crap that's that's what the church teaches you and go make babies

[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.760]
so there's another great story for Marches here so what are we gonna do about

[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.200]
those damn Puerto Ricans George was telling me before that we have more

[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.700]
Puerto Ricans and brother than we have Cubans is that is that true those were

[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:55.220]
pre-hurking in statistics what is it those were pre-Andrew statistics also

[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.940]
others after her can Andrew lot of Cubans got pushed up there in the

[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.600]
Barrett counties that way trying to tell when their houses were all blown away

[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.540]
yeah what about some nice property of the brother I don't think homestead was

[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:07.320]
mostly Cubans wasn't no but like country water a lot of great pictures down

[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:11.420]
air how about like Mexicans do we have Mexicans in Brown oh I don't think we

[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.400]
let any Mexicans in the brow yet I think we're gonna take up a resolution on

[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.260]
that but I don't think we are doing that quite yet oh by the way speaking of

[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:24.920]
Mexicans have ever gone to a supermarket in the aroma of rotting fish is the

[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.180]
what are you laughing about I was telling you I was talking about this before

[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.240]
because I happen to have that experience yet that I went into a supermarket that

[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.820]
I usually don't frequent because I was looking for my scripts my B scripts and

[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.200]
it's a beautiful market and it's clean and it's huge and great selection

[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.140]
etc although they didn't have what I was looking for God then although maybe

[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.560]
they had you know something maybe they had the bags they just was looking at

[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.080]
the right place maybe they had those of freezer bags but at any rate and I

[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.680]
walk and I open up the door and the first thing that hits you in the face is

[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.860]
that smell from the seafood department that just walks through the entire

[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:58.360]
store of rotting fish and maybe it's not rotting but it's just or like for

[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.420]
example ever go to a place like in Boston where they have all those outdoor

[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.940]
markets you know the farmers markets and I love the farmers markets where they

[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.140]
have real cheap cold cuts and produce but when you get close to the fish and

[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:16.460]
seafood department you know where they're outside oh God and of course if you

[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.640]
don't like fish to begin with if you're not a fish eater which I hate fish and

[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:24.340]
the aroma just knocks you out I just don't know how some of you guys can

[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.760]
handle it you know what I'm saying you're gotta want to get too graphic here but

[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:34.480]
but the smell of that rotting fish I just oh man woo heavy duty must have

[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.160]
something to do with nose plugs is that what's required before I go deep-seeing

[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:44.460]
diving is nose plugs before you just dive right in there man wow the smell of

[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:50.120]
that pungent rotting disgusting fish and I just want to go to the door that

[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.040]
store just race right out and get some of the fresh air even if the

[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:58.480]
outside isn't all that fresh I just say holy crap let me out of here I don't

[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.680]
I think there are other than obvious I mean there are few things in with a

[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.120]
world that smell worse than that smell of rotting fish in the other crap that

[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.180]
goes all the whatever that is God so you people that are running your super

[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.360]
markets wonder why you're not doing as much business as the other guys maybe if

[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.680]
you like you know maybe those maybe the managers of those stores have heavy

[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.660]
head cools maybe they have sinus problems because it's so apparent you walk in

[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.840]
the door and it just hits you in the face like a sledgehammer just whap just

[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.860]
like that hits you right in the post and you say man something's fishy in

[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:35.980]
this joint something stinks the high heaven it smells like crap in here I don't

[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.080]
want to say what store was because I don't want to get our friend out there

[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.340]
upset you know the one I called and said come on into our story remember that

[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.240]
day I called twice I don't want to get him upset but he might tell his

[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.960]
friends at that store I don't want to mention the name that stinks in here it's

[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.000]
11 awaited five sixty wq a you want to get a great great card out of the

[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.540]
sports pages of both our local newspapers any days of very soon 11 13 at

[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.720]
five sixty wq a and we got the open lines in date county five six seven oh five

[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.320]
sixty pound five sixty on the 18th wireless line something I forgot to mention

[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.140]
yesterday which I better get to right now immediately or I'll forget again very

[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.980]
very important I've been screaming since they opened the Macarena the hockey

[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.240]
palace up there in Broward in sunrise I've been screaming about the fact that

[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.560]
the gold lights are a little dinky tiny like Christmas lights they're so small

[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.440]
that you have to have a telescope to see him when a goal is scored which of

[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.220]
course is supposed to be the highlight the most exciting thing about a game

[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.400]
especially when the home team scores we hope but nevertheless that's supposed

[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.620]
to be an exciting thing well they have never responded that they did respond

[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.360]
to several other things lids for the for the soda cups they responded the

[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.260]
fact that the audio the sound was too loud and distorted they finally got

[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.840]
that screened out again after having a few bumpy rocks in that road and

[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.440]
evidently they're trying to clean up their app in various ways but as far as

[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.560]
the gold lights are concerned evidently Wayne has given so much money to

[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.880]
security that he can't afford like real gold lights like in a real new hockey

[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.120]
arena okay so what fine we have to live with those little dinky gold lights the

[00:20:54.120 --> 00:21:01.140]
only problem being that the ones at the north end I even got my directions right

[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:05.220]
this time the ones at the panther shoot twice and okay to my right is I'm

[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:09.300]
sitting there on 101 look into the right that goal the gold light doesn't come

[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:15.640]
on most of the time game you have that against Carolina on Saturday just a few

[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.720]
seconds into the game here's Robert's fail us this is a goal and that there's

[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.280]
the puck is right in the net looks to me like a goal on the screen and I'm

[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.980]
cheering most of the people see it's in there does the light come on no in fact

[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:28.420]
I think that a couple of times in a game maybe two or three times the light

[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.980]
actually come on when a goal was scored no we've got to put it on anymore which

[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.100]
I'm sure that the goals judge I mean his eyesight must be good enough to see

[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.180]
the puck is sitting there right in the net he's probably pressing the button maybe

[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.480]
Wayne just can't afford enough cash maybe the city of sunrise whoever's really

[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.520]
responsible there can't afford enough cash for a new light bulb in that little

[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.780]
tiny red thing in there and they're just little you know maybe we can also

[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:54.380]
along with our center one campaign we could take up a collection for like under a

[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.600]
buck whatever we're cross for a replacement light bulb for the goal light to

[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:03.560]
come on let a goal is scored I mean you talk about a sterile experience going

[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:08.500]
to hockey game this score goal and like it was the light on is something going on

[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:13.720]
here to witness anybody know I mean these are little things okay but it's

[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.880]
called going to a sporting event a lot of people paying a lot of money to

[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.500]
subsidize it by the way and they have a way to expect certain things that

[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.440]
actually have to do with the game going on as opposed to everybody in all

[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:29.800]
a dance and around oh this is the new deal now by the way of the new arena this is

[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.060]
the new deal and that is the interludes of which there are more and more and

[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.140]
longer commercial the TV timeouts and all this other book right during the

[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.220]
interludes between the action is that everybody their brothers looking up on

[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.720]
that big gigantic screen just to see if their pulses on there they're waving

[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.480]
their puke and you know I had my moment of glory there that one time which I

[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.100]
hope doesn't happen again soon because I'm wearing my no VM button just to make

[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:53.120]
sure it don't happen but at any rate so now everybody that's on it they had one

[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.320]
young woman on there I thought she was gonna do a strip act everybody in the

[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.740]
crowd was going to this is a lot more exciting than the stupid game and they

[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.640]
had some little kids say about an eight or nine year old kid up there and he's

[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.980]
he's he's like doing a strip routine I thought what the hell was this kid doing

[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.740]
he's he's doing like dirty dancing up there in the crowd he's going crazy and

[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.780]
this is the excitement okay that contrives news that the people jukin and

[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.900]
jivin in the sense the game is boring as all crap they're blowing a lead time

[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:23.420]
after time again but you're having a great time it's excitement isn't it

[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.700]
excitement no come on and go out there in the hallways and buy a lot of that

[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:33.140]
over-priced-scale food too while you're at it open line and brow at all three

[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:38.700]
in date here's L.A.V. Chilla hey hi Neil yes sir just a

[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.080]
bulk shoot of your poll questions yes you know what I found out as an Italian

[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.840]
American what is that is that I grew up in New York okay that I moved in here

[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.040]
now I'm an Italian American or are you a guido because you said in New York

[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:56.160]
well you don't say much to relatively no no you don't say for shoot now there's

[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:01.420]
it's up but a lot of the time and Jews like I find that I found this whether

[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.680]
it's culturally or food wise whatever you know combination a lot of entertainment

[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.700]
wise a lot of Italian and Jews like the same thing right especially when you

[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:16.140]
come to let's say upper middle class and up okay they like a lot of the same

[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:22.400]
as we both have big noses well I I all the Jewish people I know love the God

[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.240]
for the movie right okay they love Italian food and they like well isn't there

[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.420]
a segment of Italians like Sicilian for example because I remember when a movie

[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:34.520]
first came out and Joe Dodge Yola was doing the today's show on NBC and they

[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.480]
had priest on there and they were screaming and carrying on about the stereotypes

[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.920]
and about Sicilians are not mobsters now what you know the Italian

[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.520]
defamation league was having a nerve breakdown I know that all that comes out

[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.040]
with any news sort of like a ethnic movie there's always could be some group

[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.140]
be offended for one affection we'll talk yeah and I was reading somewhere this

[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:58.560]
is really an off-shoot but you know that when it comes to Elvis impersonators the

[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:03.300]
largest the two largest groups are Italians and Jews who are that's something huh

[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.260]
you learn something every day yeah yeah I just wanted to let you know that I see

[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.640]
tremendous similarities between Italians and Jews I I don't think there's

[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.000]
great fact when you go to Rome I think it's the same people is that's not when you

[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.500]
go to New York even the glamest begettish in New York you know that oh absolutely

[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.400]
that's the melting pot of melting pot right I just wanted to let you know that I

[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.800]
just found out throughout my life and I wonder if you felt the same thing absolutely

[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.360]
the correction okay and work on that nose okay I'll see okay there's a grito

[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.480]
from New York we have an open line in front of all three and they quiet this

[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.260]
morning when I wasn't taking calls we were loaded we had eight million calls on

[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.880]
here but I have a lot of material in fact I'll continue if you want I'll just

[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.400]
keep rambling on I'm in a ramblin mood today I'm just loaded with good

[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:48.260]
stuff today five six now now that we're I'm really putting on this push the last

[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.840]
three weeks because yesterday we were getting updates from Carol on set of

[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.280]
one like every half hour which actually make a very important goal a nice big

[00:25:54.280 --> 00:26:00.420]
round six figures and please do it or else here's a mobile in pompano hello

[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.860]
yes sir well I hope I can enlighten you in some way and I'll open you with

[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:12.220]
center one I do I do appreciate what you're doing for him and I do a belief I do

[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:17.420]
believe in how do you like that there's a great guy see when we used to do

[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.340]
camel sauce we'd get I know this may come as a shot to you but there'd be

[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.280]
several people you'll put up envelopes and then all of a sudden here be one for a

[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.800]
thousand dollars remember those days thousand dollars and we did get a check

[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.100]
for my friend Ron the hockey fan they fill out your fire's fan is a great guy

[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:34.600]
1500 bucks he donated this year usually gives me a thousand every year but

[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.900]
this year Doug deep down into his pocket 1500 bucks for which we thank him

[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.200]
profusely a lot of people off their ass raised in immediate 400 bucks from

[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.500]
right inside here right inside the QAIM and power 96 by the way power 96

[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:50.340]
you know we'll take your checks to just like Robert and sales there from power

[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:55.380]
96 we certainly your money spend just as well as anybody else's open line

[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.620]
and it's all of a sudden I guess it's going to be another one of those days

[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.040]
today but I'm used to it they're probably watching the speechment hearings

[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.060]
right now as I speak they're probably watching that crap getting all sucked into

[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.640]
that ballooning again I don't even have it on I got the weather channel on right

[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.640]
now I don't have a CNN on because every few I I have no more room in my life

[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.180]
I'm just worn out they don't get the message okay they don't get the message we

[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.140]
don't want to hear any more about it there's nothing more to be said about it

[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:22.020]
they've dissected it they've turned it upside down inside out he had an affair

[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.060]
they tried to cover it up just like everybody else does who's married and even

[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.020]
people who aren't married and then that's it it's got nothing to do with government

[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.660]
it's got nothing to do with impeachment it's got nothing to do with anything

[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.500]
but partisan politics and quite frankly I can't deal with another second of it

[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.700]
I will not watch it I don't want nothing to do with it

[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.600]
five sobel in West Palm Beach hello

[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:44.220]
hey how you doing great I couldn't agree with you more on the you're taking

[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.880]
on the panthers the fans and the arena and the only thing people care about

[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:54.440]
will be limp drop the tickets in my lap and are there a panther of key shirts

a worst game in history the human race yes come again yeah is that a

[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:43.400]
good they don't know how to choose you know the only people they can cheer is me

[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:48.240]
a liar and we're waiting it's the only true nothing we need cheer for anybody the

[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.420]
only thing they know how to do is say hey ref you suck and even when a

[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.340]
panta commits a flagrant obvious penalty you still hear the same assholes is

[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:59.000]
maybe about 500 of them they're very well very vocal it's always the same jack

[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.660]
guys is hey ref you suck as though they're impressing the rest of it and of course

[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.120]
we're all humiliated and embarrassed by their behavior and they were afraid of

[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:11.160]
me I mean even though they won one nothing it was a foreign game that you could

[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.040]
have taken a book in a small pencil flashlight and had a good time as a

[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.280]
person watching the game and I went to the Icarloin again yeah yeah and well

[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.840]
they were entertaining they're all the same fan who most of all you don't see

[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.600]
the same people two games in a row because most of the people don't have

[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.660]
season tickets they share or they get freebies or whatever and so most

[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.140]
of the time they're not going to be the only way people would go to the game

[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.820]
if it's a freebie right that's right they can see themselves up on the big

[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.480]
screen and make tools out of themselves welcome to the outside floor to serve and

[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.540]
try to fill up that please center

[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.700]

Colombians in Cuban you think that's something to do with it well what's

[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.420]
wrong with it I think that's a very legitimate pull question we want

[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:29.200]
everybody sensitive enough tighter in the holidays let's lay right out

[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:34.080]

I'm donating a hundred dollars your charity but not for a very good reason yeah

[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:54.660]
I'm donated because I hate that scumbag at the Sun Sentinel that that's a good

[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:59.720]
enough reason yeah it's not really the good reason but that's why great you know

[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.440]

[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.920]
if you're gonna dish it out you got to take it I don't care about that but it's

[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.400]
just the idea that in conjunction at a time where we're doing our fundraiser and

[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.700]
try to do the best we can for charity which I do every year at this time and I've

[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.600]
done for about the last 14 or 15 years now and this asshole's given the song

[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.980]
course isn't that interesting that this all comes right on the heels of my

[00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:01.340]
comments a few days ago this was like a few days after I was talking about the

[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:05.380]
sunset and all their hypocritical thing with the sun cruise that editorial that

[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.680]
they wrote that unacceptable idiotic editorial about how that raid was great

[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.460]
for all the citizens of Florida yeah it was great they wasted all our taxpayer

[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.620]
money and now they had to go with egg on their face last night and bring all

[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:18.500]
of that in slot machines back and bring the million dollars in cash back nice

[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.160]
going airs on sentinel one of our astute listeners sees on page two of the

[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:27.200]
sports section on the same day that that editorial ran on page two they got a

[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.060]
big ad for the sun cruise casino the very same one that they're condemning

[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:35.820]
on her editorial pages so they'll take the advertising money thank you we have

[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:41.100]
no problem whatsoever but we'll editorialize against the evils and what a

[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:45.100]
sucker better is in yada yada yada yada yada bhapapapah how corrupt you are but in

[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.960]
the meantime we'll take you ad put it right there in the sports page page two

[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:53.560]
quarter page ad or eight of the page whatever it's big fat ass look at that one

[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.920]
calling aboard you know I I just I throw my arms up and you know I say to myself

[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:04.780]
you know just play you stuff just play stuff all day I'm whipped up here I'm

[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.220]
feeling better than I have in months because actually I lost like three pounds on the

[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:12.660]
scale thanks to my season Tyson Tenderler you know and I want to say something about that

[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:17.860]
too. 50,000 fall starts I've had on these diets this year I said to myself instead of making

[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.780]
some stupid New Year's resolution which we all do why not start in December and get like

[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:26.460]
a head start on it like a month ahead. As opposed to waiting until New Year and then making

[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.980]
some stupid statement that I've broken 50 million times as you've all heard over the years

[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:34.460]
and I'm doing it and I'm going to tell you something else about it. There's no there's

[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.360]
no big secret to losing weight there's no secret about it at all. You can dilute yourself

[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.580]
with the lies like that low fat bull crap with all that you know all those low fat brownies

[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:48.540]
and cupcakes yeah right are you brownie hunts? It's bull crap you know that. But you're

[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:53.560]
just diluting yourself because that stuff tastes good. But those of us who fought the good

[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.380]
fighter even a bad fight against them there's no secret too we know how to lose the way

[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:03.400]
you just have to do it. Just do it that's all no secret whatsoever if the Atkins works

[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:09.080]
for you that's what you have to do. If Weight Watchers if that crap works for that's

[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:14.380]
what you have to do whatever it is that works for you. There's no secret. So all of this

[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:18.940]
big hoax pocus and all these fake info Marshalls and all these silly looking plastic people

[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:23.080]
under peddling you some bull crap some stupid book or some stupid pills that don't do anything

[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:27.860]
but make them money. That's not where it's at you know how to do it because all of us

[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.840]
who are fat we've all lost weight at times and then gained it back and then some and lost

[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.900]
some more and gained it we all know we all know how to lose it so you have to just do it.

[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:41.420]
Here's Hollywood hello. And you know what's up how you doing sir. I was wondering where

[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:47.280]

[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.000]

[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.760]
the address and can I give a shout out to a douchebag. No punks okay I'm not interested

[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.560]

[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:05.120]

[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:20.680]
a douchebag if you're better now why is it that as soon as he asked that question there

[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.700]
was a little tremor in the back of my brain saying I don't think so.

[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:28.360]
Hey now what's going on with these lines here this is not possible okay we're doing this

[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.160]
too long I have dial tones and all three of these day lines it is not humanly possible

[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:37.340]
is it. Two out of three your browser calls are from date. Yes see that's what I don't

[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:41.160]
understand. There is calls are forwarded to the browser lines. No I'm sorry there is

[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.920]
a trigger in the wood pile if we can get a call from Havana on the day lines the day lines

[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.120]
are working okay it's not a question of date. There is something with his phone system

[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.680]
by the way is anybody got any more information we'll remove it upstairs. Anybody hear

[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.600]
anything more about that. No. What year is going to be what century. Oh yeah they got

[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.760]
the glass the contractors that are building those new studios for power and QAM up on

[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.540]
the third floor they got the glass you know the windows for between the control room and

[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:09.680]
the studios a few days ago in pieces because they ordered it from California real expensive

[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:14.680]
stuff by the way and it came shattered and little pieces so there's another delay and

[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.420]
that's not even for us that's for power 96 so the ladies just keep on coming they must

[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:22.640]
have gotten the best contractors that money can't buy they must have gotten guys that can

[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:27.080]
wait a long time for their check that they came to the right company for that. What was

[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:34.020]
that. Oh somebody just wanted to align that to me not to explain why they're not calling

[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:39.760]
and what is that because it was he goes to were too busy that's where I cut him off. Oh

[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:39.480]

[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:08.760]
again this I was talking to Rimmer on the phone yesterday is that a surprise now my good close

[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:13.720]
personal friend Jeff Rimmer the voice of the Panthers and he we were talking about his old days in

[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.860]
Baltimore in Washington and that stuff of course he's always talking about which I don't want to

[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:21.040]
hear about but and I said well you know how were those fans in the Baltimore Washington area and he

[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:26.700]
said they stuck and maybe there was a reason they smelled so bad Baltimore has by far the country's

[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:32.120]
highest rate of syphilis at more than 30 times the national average and the city blames the rise

[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:38.020]
of crack and the trading of drugs for sex Baltimore also top the nation in Ghana Ria with the

[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:44.020]
rate nine times the national average like those Baltimore people the center for disease control

[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:21.060]
I it's it's funny bring up the the sawgrass because I've always felt there's nothing there I mean

[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.900]
you're actually going to respond to my comments about the sawgrass mills more I think one of the

[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.500]
reasons most of my audience doesn't respond is because most of us never go there and I live right

[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:34.460]
there Neil there's nothing else to do except shop and I'm not a shopper so I work all day but I

[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:39.780]
can understand shopping in a mall where they have like great stores or like the Glendale Mall out

[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:45.180]
I mean big amazing beautiful malls where they have great merchandise well what what is the attraction

[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:50.040]
what is it that they have that I haven't seen yet well the the New York diamonds exchange is pretty good

[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:54.400]
if you if you can't find you find what you want to Beverly's go to the diamond yeah well that is

[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:58.040]
what my friend Freddie's jurors is in there too and I'll forget him oh I didn't know he was in

[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:02.000]
there yes he's in there oh check Freddie's out and also our friends of Wolf camera in there too

[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.160]
so like I said Wolf camera and Freddie's jurors anything else we can think of no it's a great

[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:11.360]
place to go and I take my kids to that overpriced restaurant there the Amazon queen or jungle

[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:16.380]
whatever it is that the Amazon queen the Amazon now is that if the old two kind or the purple

[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:23.820]
parrots and the I think it's in between both of them yeah and Neil the sports on the

[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:29.380]
world thing it might say the indigo iguana yes Neil if I hear anymore about the controversy of

[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:35.380]
the ball games who should be in the field I said this yesterday and the more I listen to

[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:39.940]
more I'm convinced this man needs a levotomy he is so obsessed with this college football craft

[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:45.060]
who cares and how cares and they'll act we're not anywhere near Tallahassee we're not anywhere

[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:50.360]
near Gainesville and deep always like locked in this gator seminal thing and it's like he needs to

[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.660]
have a part of his brain removed surgery well we're not near the ball games either this is ripping

[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:59.260]
the media only you know that's neither here to there those are my opinions okay and the media

[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:02.700]
over the years they're setting good things about me in this show they said some crappy things they

[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.860]
take in some shots hey that's the way it goes but when you're trying to do something for a good

[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:10.840]
charity and you try to raise some money there is any reason to be a hard ass but of course the media

[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:15.400]
in this town are basically a bunch of hardasses especially buddy never he's an asshole exactly

[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:21.200]
and a little pork with a bad beard so you know what he sends this out and we'll wait with it is

[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.260]
new times gonna be putting this in no how about city lia george's laugh and hysterically how about

[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:31.200]
city link no which I think they left the H out of that word how they spell out s i t y s i t t y

[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:36.880]
city link are they gonna be putting in a plug for our no there you go so you know it's great and

[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.420]

[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:45.320]
gonna give us any assistance on this how about Tom jikka Tom right anything about our center one

[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:49.420]
fund razor no all the money near rages is raised for charity no about the only time it's ever been

[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:53.600]
even mentioned was when Ellie Brecker wrote that big tough piece which I think her for profusely

[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:58.480]
and she put that in there and you know a couple of other times over the years there's been like a

[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.420]
mention a casual mention of the fact the a committal house in center one and the fund razor

[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:06.720]
etc and so on well the purpose of that series besides the goose up their ratings during the

[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.540]
uh... sweeps we can November the purpose of that series was allegedly to show the good side of

[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:15.100]
the people on the air they you know even the eruders who comes off like a real prick on a radio

[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:19.240]
he's a good guy he does nice things he helps other people he wore raises money for charity

[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:25.440]
and there was nothing not one word said about any of the fundraisers and it was timely it was

[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:30.460]
it was the piece appeared during the period of time when we're in the middle of the fund razor

[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.360]
was there anything on your about it no thank you so much Diane

[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:38.380]

well just ask your wife she'll tell you like it you want it hard not soft

[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:59.100]
okay one line left on the board look at this this is this is brutal

[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.300]
you know and in the thing and you know what really killed me about this audience and about

[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:08.020]
this whole town in general is when you you know here a guy comes and takes a cheap shot which really

[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.980]
you know you have sets a fire off under my eyes about our fundraising thing and at the time when

[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.420]
you're reading looking for the audience no one's saying to come forward give you some support

[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:19.260]
oral support like uh you know they're behind you they're with you they want to do something they

[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:25.520]
want to make something happen and they just disappear they just vanish you know you go on do

[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:30.420]
these appearances 20 people show up well we're too busy for that we're all listening but we're all

[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:36.660]
too busy we got more important things to do and that's what happens when you stay in one place

[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:40.780]
two god damn long they take you for granted like the woodwork like the carpeting you know like the

[00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:44.010]
furniture it's just there and you take it for granted

[00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:52.390]
George is giving me a dumb look and I'm giving him a dumb look so you're right yeah I know I'm

[00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:56.430]
right I know I'm right but I mean this is this is just pathetic I got one caller on the board

[00:48:56.430 --> 00:49:02.710]
again the deadline somehow died on me today just died and no matter how many different things I've

[00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:06.350]
talked about it these people got nothing because that whatever it is that they're doing maybe

[00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:09.590]
they're running to the song right to investigate for me to see what's going on there it's so

[00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:13.290]
I don't know what it is that they're doing but it's a hell of a lot more important than us maybe

[00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:16.430]
they're sitting there watching this stupid crap I'm going to tell you something if there are people

[00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:22.830]
out there watching this impeachment crap again god help us all if you people are sitting there

[00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:27.010]
watching all these talking head pontificating and saying the same crap we've been here for the last

[00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:31.730]
12 months now then you need assistance man this whole country needs help

[00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:37.730]
by say you know and we can pot it up if you want to hear the god damn impeachment hearings

[00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:41.310]
that we can pot it up does that see it and pot is that thing hooked up in here now

[00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:45.670]
did we get that straightened out pot it up and see if this clown is on there this

[00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:51.930]
be spectacle clown that's hot gonna try it he's talking we don't hear nothing

[00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.850]
no

[00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:12.850]
are you crapping me so in other words there's something momentous was about to happen which

[00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:17.850]
is not but if it were and we wanted to put it on here we can't do it again because of the

[00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:21.710]
technical incompetence in this joint and it was working before yeah it was working though yeah

[00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:25.570]
well every now and end just like oh when we come on here yesterday we came on had a problem come

[00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:31.390]
on again today had a problem technical amazement and these guys upstairs oh we don't understand

[00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:36.890]
what Neil's all upset about why he's making such a big fuss all you'd like to do is just come

[00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:42.290]
in do the best you can under all formidable odds try to do four hours of something whatever

[00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:47.970]
that you call this a crap and one day the stuff works the next day it doesn't work the glasses

[00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:53.070]
on away from California and you know and everybody's walking around when they're

[00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:56.690]
fingering each other back home in the meantime technically they beasley people ate his

[00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:00.830]
zester you're an embarrassment the beesleys over there in Naples you people are an industry

[00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:06.450]
embarrassment I don't care how if people get pissed off here and that it's the truth it's the truth

[00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:10.690]
there are kids with little toy radio stations in their basement up north who have better equipment

[00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:16.190]
than we've got on guarantee a pipe or high up there at the KPS they got better stuff than we got

[00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:22.890]
an equipment too you know keep banging on it 10 minutes after an equipment to 10

[00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:26.950]
I asked that's why I tested it because I had this feeling in the in the pit of my

[00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:30.730]
rectum stomach that we're going to be shut out again

[00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:38.230]
Neil Rogers got 17 at 560 WQAM while we had the 8,000 calls on and lying when we were to see

[00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:42.730]
again it's partly a product of this to a format which I'm told well the answer for that is after

[00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:46.390]
December is over and then when January comes we won't have any business on the log and you'll

[00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:49.910]
have no spots radio again and then you'll get some calls to hold on for a while because they might

[00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:56.590]
you might actually get to some well that's terrific that's really great boys 5 6 7 0 5 6 8

[00:51:56.590 --> 00:52:01.810]
0 5 6 the animal will one one and again the bottom line is they don't care they do not care

[00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:06.990]
we must get on 20 million spots because we owe Wayne the mortgage on the whole goddamn place okay

[00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:11.870]
we must get on 50 billion spots because that's the only that's the only way we can possibly survive

[00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:19.870]
dummy here's a mobile in Miami hello Neil God yes sir hey how you doing you're talking about

[00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:24.530]
supermarkets a little earlier yeah and I was wondering what happened to there was a supermarket I
