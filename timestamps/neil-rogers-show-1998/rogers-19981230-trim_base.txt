[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]
Sports Radio 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.620]
The Neil called 5600560 toll free for date and barrage.

[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.900]
For pound 560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.240]
Yes.

[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.380]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM,

[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.220]
some easily read acquisitions or the easily broadcasted.

[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.360]
No.

[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.620]
Now, Neil Rogers on Sports Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.900]
Sarah, what's the matter?

[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.920]
Oh, Judy.

[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.480]
I just found out.

[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.700]
Michael has Cardon.

[00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.480]
Oh, no.

[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.620]
I just don't know what to do.

[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.560]
Well, when Shirley's boyfriend had one, he went to the Hard On Treatment Center of America.

[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.060]
Hard On Treatment Center?

[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.720]
Yeah, it's a place where they teach men how to wake up small and uninterested.

[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.180]
Do you think they could help Michael?

[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.320]
They were very kind and caring when Philip had his owner.

[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.280]
He doesn't even watch the USA Channel at night anymore.

[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.760]
The Hard On Treatment Center of America.

[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.140]
Helping so many Americans through their hardship.

[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.880]
Brought on by Big Boots in so many aerospace myths videos.

[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.960]
He's called today.

[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.560]
Don't get excited.

[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.580]
You're not alone.

[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.760]
The Hard On Treatment Center of America.

[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.320]
Cold water standing by.

[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.020]
Hey, happy anniversary, Neil.

[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.520]
Thank you.

[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.840]
Isn't that your anniversary today?

[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.700]
One year on its radio station?

[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.480]
All right.

[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.920]
Are we getting like tons and tons of faxes and balloons?

[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.500]
No.

[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.220]
Of course not.

[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.500]
But Greg Reed did come down here and check my hand today and say,

[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.800]
Happy anniversary, I made it one year.

[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.240]
Yeah.

[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.720]
And that was pretty exciting.

[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.480]
I guess that was it.

[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.940]
No balloons, no big deal.

[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.320]
I guess we'll have to get some food in here.

[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.180]
They have a big party.

[00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.600]
We'll have our own goddamn celebration.

[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.600]
That's the way we do it.

[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.220]
We have plenty of practice doing that by ourselves.

[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.980]
Of course, I'm sure lots of you can relate to that.

[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.080]
But I do have one facts from Don at Homestead.

[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.320]
There's one guy out there.

[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.800]
One Goy at Homestead.

[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.520]
It was at least got the cajon's, where he has a good memory.

[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.220]
One year ago today, December 30th, 1997, they said it couldn't be done.

[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.500]
And here we were.

[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.160]
We didn't think it was going to be done either.

[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.880]
930 the night before, they're still putting stuff in here.

[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.360]
They're poaching around and it looked like it was impossible.

[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.140]
Couldn't be done.

[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.860]
They said it couldn't be done and we almost did it.

[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.240]
By the way, we got about 140 grand for Santa one.

[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.420]
And still these last couple of days.

[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.440]
I wouldn't be surprised if we wind up with everything totaled up.

[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.460]
Maybe 145, even 150.

[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.200]
Other time, everything is like all factored in there.

[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.800]
Wouldn't surprise me.

[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.580]
So nice going guys on the day of your daughter's wedding.

[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.240]
So we got let's see 13.

[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.740]
I think he was like fudging a little bit.

[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.280]
Maybe he knows Pudge Brown that Evans guy Dave Evans.

[00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.500]
It was not one of the worst team this morning.

[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.440]
Probably more like 14,000 unsold seats for the game on.

[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.740]
And they've extended the deadline till tomorrow at 1230.

[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.080]
Little Vos says he thinks it'll be extended beyond that.

[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.800]
Do we agree with that?

[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.000]
No.

[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.760]
No, I don't think so.

[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.560]
I was the game of Saturday.

[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.020]
Why would they extend the deadline till 1230 on Friday?

[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.920]
Highly unlikely.

[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.180]
Unprecedented.

[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.080]
So that means if they don't sell another 12 or 13,000 tickets by 1230 tomorrow.

[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.180]
There's going to be no local TV for the offense bills game on Saturday.

[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.680]
A major major embarrassment in this big, big time sports town.

[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.960]
In fact, if you watched that, I watched about two minutes of that,

[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.100]
that the hurricane game last night.

[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.700]
That pool and weed wacker MCI.

[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.720]
Whatever the hell that thing was.

[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.920]
Bowl game.

[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.480]
In the claim that there were 44,000 people in there.

[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.340]
If so, there must have been about 10,000 of the skies as empty seats.

[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.140]
Because you could go bowling in the upper deck.

[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.400]
There was nobody at all in the upper deck.

[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.800]
And the lower bowl was like big patches of empty orange.

[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.020]
There must have been a lot of people dressed in orange there last night.

[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.360]
Because it was vacant.

[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.240]
So what's the excuse?

[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.100]
I guess the excuse is it's the homelace.

[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.900]
And a lot of people are out of town, right?

[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.360]
Could that possibly be part of it?

[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.200]
That could be it.

[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.180]
Or maybe the excuse is that it's just the usual bush leg town.

[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.700]
That could be it.

[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.120]
By the way, we own a apology to the entire community.

[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.020]
Although I had no control over it.

[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.260]
Yesterday we were doing the show and we were rolling long singing the song.

[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.080]
And then the one to two hour kind of hit a dead spot.

[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.120]
And I started thinking about it.

[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.680]
And I go and watch the news last night.

[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.120]
And I realized, as usual, since we operate here at a vacuum on this radio station,

[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.860]
I-95 was tied up for seven hours yesterday.

[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.140]
They had traffic backed up for miles and miles and miles and miles.

[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.080]
And I'm sitting here doing a radio show.

[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.760]
And we have a lot of people in this audience who listen to their radio,

[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.020]
who unfortunately have to be in their car, their truck, their van, their scooter,

[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.800]
whatever they're doing for their job or maybe they have a life, I don't know.

[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.900]
But I guarantee you, many of those people who are sitting there in 95 wondering,

[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.660]
don't they know anything about what's going on out here?

[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.940]
Are they going to give us any information?

[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.280]
No.

[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.640]
No.

[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.380]
Now we do have this, they believe, traffic service,

[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.220]
which I don't even know which one it is on this station.

[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.220]
Because I would have to listen in the morning to find out.

[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.000]
And I try to avoid that as much as possible.

[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.880]
Do we know what it is?

[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.700]
We don't know.

[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.920]
No.

[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.200]
No.

[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.480]
Okay, but anyway, so we got to come and bump that traffic.

[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.940]
What is it?

[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.140]
Metro traffic.

[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.740]
Oh, Metro traffic.

[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.620]
Now is that the one that Joe, what's his name is with?

[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.200]
Joe Brennan.

[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.600]
Yes, he was.

[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.440]
What do you mean he was?

[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.040]
He got canned.

[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.600]
Grimley says he still is.

[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.480]
Yeah.

[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.280]
Why are we- are we getting a ton of information from over there today or what?

[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.320]
Just like, like, barely got to squeeze it out of Joe over there this morning in the awards too.

[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.820]
So that's the one that Joe Brennan is with.

[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.180]
And of course, over the years, we know that what a bunch of losers they are to begin with.

[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.200]
And so, you know, in the past over this one year that we've been on this radio station and somehow survived it,

[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.340]
once in a great while.

[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.040]
I'm not going to say very often because we don't do traffic here in midday.

[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.540]
Because you know there's no big traffic.

[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.600]
There's just one more unneeded interruption, which we already got more than enough of those already.

[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.480]
But in the past a couple of times there have been those occasions.

[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.020]
I think like maybe twice in the last year when they've come on and said,

[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.940]
well, guess what?

[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.180]
There's a problem on the turnpike.

[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.660]
There's a problem over here on the Palmetto.

[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.740]
Please put it on the air.

[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.460]
Let your listeners find out what's going on.

[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.140]
Because yesterday when I came in here,

[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.760]
441 was all backed up.

[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.440]
I mean, it was- I get off the turnpike, off I was during the road.

[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.720]
I make my turn out to 441.

[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.100]
It's not even moving.

[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.340]
And I'm wondering to myself what the-

[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.440]
It's going on here, you know?

[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.600]
And now I realize that everybody was off in 95 because they were all taken 441 to go wherever they had to go.

[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.160]
So we apologize profusely, but do we have a like a-

[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.040]
Even a newswire?

[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.360]
No.

[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.120]
Do we have like any information unless it has to do with a ballgame or something and do with sniffing a jock strap?

[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.500]
We know nothing about it here on this radio station, okay?

[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.900]
If they're dropping bombs like I've told you to be-

[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.700]
I predicted this year ago when I came here.

[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.600]
If they're dropping nuclear weapons on homestead, would we know about it?

[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:49.800]
No.

[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.260]
Hey Joe Rosoli comes through.

[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.600]
I even had written that down.

[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.400]
Thank God!

[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.140]
Thank God for our good buddy, Joe Rosoli, from Roth Office Supply.

[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.180]
Yeah, we had a little bit of a problem here.

[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.840]
Again, another little insufficiency.

[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.500]
I don't want to belly it because we're certainly not as cheap as Clear Channel,

[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.880]
which I'll mention that we're concerned story again because it happens to be true and very, very sad.

[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.300]
The cheapest backdudes on the face of the earth buying up every station insight, Queer Channel Broadcasting.

[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.220]
So we even know the beesleaves are as tight as a snare drum,

[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.120]
not even the same league with Queer Channel.

[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.120]
But Joe Rosoli comes through with our 1999 calendar.

[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.240]
You know, those big planter calendars like you have to actually white something down on them.

[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.660]
So we have some idea of what's going on.

[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.720]
Because unfortunately for the rest of the staff,

[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.020]
the calendars like for the sales holes and all the other people around here,

[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.160]
they're not going to be into what?

[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.740]
You said February.

[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.560]
Till February.

[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.920]
Now they didn't say what year.

[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.340]
Maybe we have a Y99 problem here.

[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.260]
What channel is that? Y99, huh?

[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.100]
We got a little bit of a problem here.

[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.280]
We can't get the new calendars in quite a time.

[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.400]
So by February, maybe if they're lucky they'll have them.

[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.820]
But we got them now before we're right before the end of the year. Thanks to Joe Rosoli.

[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.060]
Nice going, Joe. God bless you.

[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.020]
And happy new year, et cetera and so on.

[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.900]
Eight minutes after 10, I want to get that thing on that was a great piece about Channel 4,

[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.180]
a scandal by Howard Beale.

[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.400]
I got to hear somewhere here it is.

[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.040]
And then of course we have to do the history of all the happy dances at the football games.

[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.840]
I'll let Jucke and Javan, I'll let the horrible crap that goes on.

[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.120]
That a lot of you pretend that you really think is entertaining.

[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.140]
And in the meantime, you're just sitting back there saying, hey, look at that nigger rack like a n-

[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.640]
You know, that's what it's all about.

[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.520]
It's embarrassing, it's humiliating.

[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:31.440]
And I keep trying to tell, oh, you poor black folks out there, stop letting white America continue, you know, keeping you under their thumb.

[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.640]
By participating and advocating and enthusiastically embracing behavior that makes people look like step-in-featured.

[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.400]
It's garbage, okay?

[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.540]
I don't want to pick a single anybody out.

[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.140]
We don't need any more apologies from Lamar Thomas or anybody else.

[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.260]
But the fact is, cut the crap already, okay?

[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.320]
It's got nothing to do there.

[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.220]
No separate culture for celebrating.

[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.180]
Like saying, oh, well, I'm driving, I'd be driving this way because we got a separate culture.

[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.340]
We'd be driving this way, okay?

[00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.960]
You'd be driving lonely on the road, but I'd be in the other lane.

[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.380]
Okay, that's a cultural thing.

[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.300]
Is anybody believe that?

[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:02.500]
No.

[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.100]
Of course not.

[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.600]
But in any way, don't go getting all worked up about it.

[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.640]
It's the 30th of December.

[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.020]
We got it.

[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.320]
We got it linked one year to the day.

[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.280]
Look at the phones.

[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.140]
They're lighting up like crazy, aren't they?

[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.380]
No.

[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.540]
Happy anniversary, Neil.

[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.400]
One year on Q&A.

[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.340]
They said it couldn't be done.

[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.640]
Sports radio, 560 QAF.

[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.780]
Oh, it's a good deal.

[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.520]
Look at New York Times once dubbed as approaching humorous.

[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.360]
Mark Russell.

[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.140]
Well, as you know, the commander-in-chief has been accused of being caught with his pants down.

[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.540]
Shall we say?

[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.020]
So, I wrote this little song about it.

[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.040]
And it goes something like this.

[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.680]
The president and the intern.

[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.780]
The president and the intern.

[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.540]
He'll magically protest pants on the president and the intern.

[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.960]
Mark Russell, did you talk political commentary in 20 original songs that all sound exactly like that?

[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.600]
She went to get a job.

[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.660]
She went to get a job.

[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.160]
Kelly will wake up, Milton, when she went to ask for a job.

[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.820]
Mark Russell, why?

[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.520]
This week on TVS.

[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.660]
For a guy who doesn't sit down when he plays the piano, he is pretty funny.

[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.680]
Bill Clinton likes morals, thanks.

[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.460]
Bill Clinton likes morals, thanks.

[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.560]
Did I mention he likes morals, thanks.

[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.100]
Bill Clinton likes morals, thanks.

[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.340]
Thank you.

[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.500]
Oh, what a crowd.

[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.320]
Oh, what a laugh of minute.

[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.240]
Now, he is the worst.

[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.140]
10, 14, 5, 60, WQM.

[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.740]
Here's a fact from Bill, who says happy one year anniversary, etc.

[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.180]
And so on.

[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:28.840]
Thanks a lot, Bill.

[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.540]
Here's another fact.

[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.660]
This is more out of town scores.

[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.980]
Please don't have scoreboard there.

[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.520]
It's a Panther game instead of showing all those idiots constantly up so they can see themselves

[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.840]
on the scoreboard up there at generalized.

[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.280]
Let's see the out of town scores instead of just between the periods.

[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.580]
Actually, for a while, they're there.

[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.640]
I think they lost their minds for about one or two games and actually we're showing them up there in the corners, all through the game.

[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.740]
So we won't see that anymore because let's face it.

[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.340]
If you're not interested in the local score, why in the world would you be interested in the out of town scores?

[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.740]
In other words, there are no fans here anyway.

[00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:58.820]
But I'm not going to go back into that again.

[00:10:58.940 --> 00:10:59.800]
That's my New Year's resolution.

[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.180]
Forget it because they don't care.

[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.620]
That's one of the least interested things of anything in the world in this town is the little hockey scene.

[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:06.360]
They don't know about it.

[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.120]
They don't care about it.

[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.980]
And I keep trying to convince myself of that and it makes me want to cry.

[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:18.420]
So anyway, how would be, or whatever this guy's real name is, in the city link, December 23rd, a week ago, writes in MediaWatch.

[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.400]
Here's Mutton Uri.

[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.620]
CBS's Glory Days in South Florida are long since over.

[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.700]
As WFOR continues its downward slide.

[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:32.200]
There was a time not so long ago when the Columbia Broadcasting System was reverent as the one that emulates and television news.

[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:42.760]
From the early days of scratchy black and white images to more recent times, the satellite images bounced around the globe and from planet to planet working for CBS meant adhering to a code of ethics, loyalty and journalism.

[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:54.120]
In South Florida, CBS television once meant Ralph Redneck followed by Walter Cronkider, Dan Radler, solid community reporting and a disdain for reaching into the snake well pits of flash and trash newscasting.

[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.200]
Welcome to the latter stages of the 20th century, Alice.

[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.760]
This certainly isn't your father's CBS and I'm the anymore and to be fair, it shouldn't be.

[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:13.020]
The technology of news gathering and reporting is advanced so far and so fast in the last decade where used to be the prominent source, preeminent source of televised information would now be looked upon as video dinosaur bones, progress and all that you understand.

[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:20.480]
But what CBS has accomplished here in South Florida certainly has never been done before by any other corporate owner of any of the other top or 20 rated markets.

[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:33.720]
Beginning with a purchase of then independent WCIX Channel 6, continuing with a great signal swap of NBC and becoming WFOR Channel 4, ending with a recent and still pending personnel changes, CBS has made history.

[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:42.360]
They have single handedly created the most annoying, least creative, uninformative, poorly staff, badly managed news station in the history of television.

[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.560]
Hands down, no question and those are the good points.

[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:56.960]
Let's begin with the signal swap. When NBC bought WTBG and Miami, CBS execs in New York City, Panicked, realizing they had to do something or surrender the potentially lucrative market to the competition.

[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:03.340]
Their only alternative was to buy WCIX Channel 6, which was expected but had an audience limited limiting weak signal.

[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:11.960]
Making a very long and convoluted story short, CBS coughed up millions of dollars to swap Channel 6 for NBC Channel 4 and renamed the station WFOR.

[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:17.520]
CBS officials coveted the deal as a major coup, they couldn't lose management scheme.

[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:30.580]
Lose they did in the most embarrassing manner, Channel 4 has never made a consistent profit for CBS and while experiencing brief moments of success as slipped into the television never-world of rarely ever being a newscast rating contender.

[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:41.500]
All this while those groups from NBC who took the CBS cash and ran with a rotten signal, filled the ranks with Channel 6 with well-known faces and black and CBS's eye on an almost daily basis.

[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:49.620]
CBS made every mistake possible in those early days. The most damaging was Jettisoning veteran anchor Barbara Sloan.

[00:13:50.580 --> 00:14:00.200]
Never flashy but always a solid reporter. While station officials denied it, most believed she was bounced for being too old and not fitting the station's new flashier image.

[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:11.480]
Sloan and many others who replaced with a seemingly never-ending stream of Ken and Barbie types and stick artists who are now featured on tapes used by broadcast instructors to vividly illustrate what never did to the show.

[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.300]
In the past, the show was a very rare thing to do in television news. Most of them thankfully have forever faded from memory.

[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:27.260]
Fast forward to the painful present where Channel 4's losing money hand over fist, credibility ratings are plummeting and morale is only slightly higher than death row before the juices turned on.

[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.740]
CBS wheels in New York are tied of shelling out huge vux-ray huge failure and decide something must be done quickly.

[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:40.860]
In walks Mel Carmesen, the former head of infinity broadcasting, considered one of the two visionaries in broadcasting.

[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:51.860]
Then again, everyone in the industry knows visionaries usually managers speak for hatchet wielding bloodless assassin who knows the only way to make real money is to treat workers like the Pharaoh treated slaves.

[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.200]
Everyone from the top down at WFOR shutters when the announcement is made. Everyone.

[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:07.820]
General manager Alan Shaqlin, his days are numbered. Shaqlin managed to survive in the sea of red ink since the early days of CBS purchase are promising ownership that things will get better.

[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.800]
They don't of course. He's about to get bounced when he announces he's leading to spend more time with his family.

[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.740]
Weeks later, he accepts a position at a TV station at Atlanta.

[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:22.120]
Yes, the family didn't look so good when viewed up close and personal. Then having escaped with a tidy buyout didn't hurt either.

[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:32.920]
Carmesen installed Steve Maulden as the new general manager and staffers know the station will soon start resembling a Marie Antoinette spirit reunion with hedge rolling factor than they could be blow dried.

[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.380]
This is great. This is one of the great columns and of course it has to be in city length that nobody reads.

[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:43.840]
From the outset Maulden proves once again that television means never having to say you've learned your lesson.

[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:50.000]
With ratings dropping CBS swings the accident and hits sportscaster turn lead anchor Cambrale Marshall.

[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:57.900]
Granted, Marshall will never be mistaken for red Bradley, but he was known for his exhaustive efforts to aid the community, never turning down the opportunity to help.

[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:07.520]
Marshall is considered by those who know him to be a rarity in television, truly down to earth, unimpressed with the celebrity status, a really nice guy, which means he has no future in current television.

[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:18.500]
Marshall wasn't the problem at WFOR, everything and everyone else around him is the problem, but like a GM or a head coach someone had to be fired as an example of the save some execs Tony Belone job.

[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:28.800]
Co-anchor Anne Roberts who could never be mistaken for a bimbo style female anchor instead has alienated viewers and co-workers alike with a true lack of any talent or personality.

[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:46.920]
The Barbie Rule at WFOR is currently held by anchor Jennifer Gould, Ken Rosado was the perfect Ken to Gould's Barbie, fake smile, well practiced cliches, body English by Sega, and completely unable to deliver even the slightest line without if you were wondering if the lights are truly on behind the facade.

[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.080]
Once the savior of thousands from Hurricane Andrew, Brian Norcross has now become an embarrassment.

[00:16:53.860 --> 00:17:04.560]
Having a clause inserted in his contract upon leaving Channel 6 that allowed him to anchor newscast, Norcross has proven aligned spoken by Clint Eastwood in one of those dirty hairy movies, a man's got to know his limitations.

[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:10.740]
Norcross doesn't know his, but we can tell him if he's interested. Float back over to that weather map Brian.

[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:19.660]
Sports anchor Jim Berry has become the single greatest example of stuff a grandizing self-serving egotistical television boars.

[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:28.620]
Is that having one thing since being dumped in Chicago? Berry has only managed to keep from being considered the worst sports catcher at the station because Joseph Gacky works there as well.

[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.740]
Is this incredible or a...

[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:45.600]
Okay, when Denver Broncos running back to Ralph Davis recently made an appearance on Sesame Street and was doing the alphabet with a Muppets, Berry couldn't resist once again making sure he was the center of attention.

[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:52.480]
Editors took that resettle of the alphabet and spliced together Davis spelling out J-I-M-B-R-R-Y.

[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:59.800]
One can only hope that after the grim reaper comes calling, Jim Henson welcomes Berry to the next world by beating him senseless with a used Miss Piggy doll.

[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:11.360]
And now comes word that Shannon High has been hired as news director. A former associate producer at the station, most recently assistant news director at Channel 7, most expect high to assume the role of a hatchet woman.

[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:20.120]
She's expected to carry out the mandate from chromosome to record greater profits by cutting salaries and finding followers instead of leaders, actors instead of journalists.

[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:31.640]
Rumble has it, Berry should worry about a new contract, perhaps nurcross as well. Several defections have been recorded in the front office recently and there are plenty more to come as people realize what the future holds at Channel 4.

[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.840]
Maybe Leonardo DiCaprio can play General Manager Maldon in the movie.

[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:45.900]
One of the great articles in the history of this town by Howard Beale, bar sure wish he had a real name at CityLink Magazine.

[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.940]
And right on target from what I understand, the circus over there.

[00:18:53.060 --> 00:19:02.860]
Okay, let's delve into these calls, such as the ever got a couple of them on the board and I want to talk about all the juken and jyvin and the high step and the dirty bird and the funky chicken and the California quake.

[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.340]
Oh yeah, we got to get into the history of that.

[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.880]
Here's a, what is it? Mobile and Port St. Lucy, hello.

[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.240]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:10.740]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.060]
All right, long time no speak.

[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.800]
First of all, I don't know if you watched last night's the Murkung game.

[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:17.340]
No.

[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.520]
Okay, well, I was...

[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.300]
Talk about 30 seconds just to see what the crowd was, it was pretty weak.

[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.900]
Well, the crowd was pretty weak, but they played a hell over game.

[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:24.580]
Yeah, who cares?

[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:32.240]
And one thing overall that I noticed was, most of the guys, I don't know what the college teams regulations are.

[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:37.360]
When they sort of touchdowns, anything goes, doing that dirty dog or the dirty bird or whatever.

[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:37.640]
Yeah.

[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.620]
And they've been in pretty good sales recently.

[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:45.340]
So it looked like, uh, I got a little bit of a sign line and beat up some of the cheerleaders, probably with their girlfriends, I don't know, I didn't see it.

[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.020]
Well, I think so. I don't know if they still do that.

[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.740]
But, you know, as a college level, I didn't get so seen a little bit more, uh, control over the play.

[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.700]
Yeah, because it's prohibited by the rules. They can't do that.

[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.700]
Because they get the flag forth for excessive celebration, that's right.

[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:10.160]
Well, you know, I noticed that they did give them a penalty, like, uh, 50 or 10, I think it was during the third quarter for one of the teams that's something like, uh, out of the ordinary.

[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:16.660]
And, uh, you know, I guess I said they got to keep implementing those rules that way they can control them.

[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:16.900]
Yeah.

[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:22.400]
Another thing is that you, uh, the Blake family was there last night and they were interviewing them.

[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.500]
I believe a Brian blade was there.

[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.000]
Yeah.

[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]
Uh, and, uh, it was like, it looked like you never committed a crime.

[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:29.960]
Yeah.

[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.060]
And, uh, you probably have a couple of drinks with his old buddy, Dennis Derrickson.

[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.140]
He's got a lot of time on his hands.

[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.720]
Another probably a remiss of about all time.

[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:37.320]
Okay.

[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.580]
There's probably one in high and jumping faster. How's it the other way around?

[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.260]
I want to wish you a happy anniversary.

[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.300]
And for your one year of W2 AM.

[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:52.340]
And if I, it's not too much to ask, I would like to give you a little request about, you got one bit about, uh, Snickers and the looker.

[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.880]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.280]
Snickers and the hooker.

[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.240]
Hi, I'm a whore or some of that.

[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.940]
Hi, I'm a whore. Okay, I'll work on it.

[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.020]
Hey, happy new year.

[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:00.820]
Happy new year, pal. Good.

[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:01.000]
Hi.

[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.380]
Okay. Hi, I'm a whore.

[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.040]
Okay, we got one call on the board here today. Happy anniversary, Neil.

[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.500]
Thank you.

[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.100]
56670560, pound 560 on a mobile one line.

[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:09.540]
Wow.

[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.340]
Here's the lady in Miramar.

[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:11.660]
Hello.

[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.100]
Hey, good morning, Neil.

[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:13.640]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.940]
I was wondering, could you play the silence of the lamb bit?

[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:16.820]
No.

[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.400]
That was no lady.

[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:18.940]
That was a kid.

[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:19.940]
That was a little kid, wasn't it?

[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:20.940]
Was a lady?

[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.080]
Okay, that's it.

[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.040]
That's her calls for the day.

[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.640]
So I'm going to do this thing after the break.

[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.140]
I'll do the thing about the funky chicken and the dirty bird.

[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.220]
And then we'll play the record rest of the day and then I got all day tomorrow.

[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:31.780]
Wow.

[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.720]
You could knock me over with a feather duster right now.

[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.860]
Goes to show you never expect anything from the South Florida audience.

[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.280]
And then you'll be, uh, then you'll really get what you expect.

[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:40.140]
That's right.

[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.280]
56670560, pound 560 on a mobile one line.

[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.100]
They are dead as a door, Neil, baby.

[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.300]
Better than a proverbial goddamn door.

[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.180]
Well, it's New Year's Eve coming up tomorrow.

[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:51.520]
Okay?

[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.260]
We got a lot of stuff to worry about here.

[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.900]
We got a lot of important crap going on.

[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.240]
Okay?

[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.040]
We don't have time to talk to some fat Jew Fag on a radio.

[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.580]
We celebrate in one year on QA and we resent the fact that he's down there.

[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.380]
Anyway, oh, by the way, speaking of who's on.

[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.500]
Hank continues on vacation today.

[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:07.300]
Bill Zimfer.

[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:08.840]
I looked at the schedule.

[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.440]
I almost peed in my pants.

[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.220]
Bill Zimfer is going to be on here at two o'clock from two to six villain for Hank today,

[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.800]
which I find most bizarre.

[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.680]
And then six o'clock we got Josh Friedman for an hour kind of killing some time in there.

[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:27.160]
And the seven o'clock to pregame with Gildi because we got the panthers and the penguins in Pittsburgh tonight.

[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.580]
Gonna be watching that, anybody?

[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:29.960]
No.

[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:30.860]
I didn't think so.

[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:31.460]
I will.

[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.680]
26 after 10 at 560 WQM when you're...

[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.720]
Oh my god, your breath, the beautiful.

[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.400]
We were having alien anal probe.

[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.300]
You've ever been impregnated by a creature from a far off galaxy.

[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.800]
The only thing you took away from the experience was a strange rash in that chip that's still in your brain.

[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.720]
Why'd you like to pick up a nice lump of cash the next time an intergalactic traveler decides to pick you up?

[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.080]
Well, now you can with abduction insurance.

[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.260]
You've heard the crazy farmers and low-rend white trash talk about it.

[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.040]
So you know it's true.

[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.960]
Alien abductions do happen.

[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.700]
And now for the first time in the history of mankind, you can actually benefit from your next abduction.

[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.960]
Just pass a little bit each month and the next time you take a little trip, come back to Earth and show us that chip in your head.

[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.020]
Or the rod in your ass.

[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.660]
And the claim is as good as yours.

[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.800]
Abduction insurance. Sign up today and get free as a bonus.

[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.180]
A meteorite proof from Brella. Just in case.

[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.940]
10.30 to 5.60 W.Q.M.O.

[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.080]
The main reason that that column was so great that I read by Howard Beale.

[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.660]
In fact, the best thing since he said...

[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.660]
Prime Minister Madden Hill, I just couldn't take this anymore.

[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.080]
Oh!

[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.620]
...was because it said something.

[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.220]
Not just because it ripped in.

[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.720]
I mean, because all the ripping was very accurate right on target.

[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.380]
But because here's somebody that actually wrote a column and said something.

[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:36.680]
Oh!

[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.160]
Which is such a rarity in this town.

[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:44.300]
Even on the worst thing this morning, they were talking about how Eddie the Pope and his columns lately becoming more and more incoherent.

[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.360]
Not that they were ever any good.

[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:49.300]
And you read it and you wonder what is he writing this for?

[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.640]
What is it that he's trying to say?

[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.380]
Can anybody figure it out?

[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:52.600]
No.

[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.040]
Does anybody want to figure it out?

[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:54.280]
No.

[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.840]
By the way, it got me a... that thing with the toilet seat.

[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.380]
Everything turns into a major project.

[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.900]
I went to Builder Square over there right by the sawgrass, which is right by my house.

[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.820]
And you know, that's definitely going to happen in here.

[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.920]
I walk up to the place and the first bad oldman was they have all these big signs

[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.700]
passing all over the front of the joint that say,

[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.620]
close out, going out of business, everything must go.

[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.800]
And of course, the problem is when you go into a home depot where Builder Square one of those places

[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.500]
that they're so gigantic and huge.

[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:23.340]
You know?

[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.940]
Remember the old days you'd go into a supermarket?

[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.280]
I think Grand Union used to do it.

[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.260]
Maybe that's why they're out of business.

[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.460]
And there used to be on the front.

[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.980]
Why did they're front of the store?

[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.300]
They used to be like a big directory.

[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:40.660]
And like if you were looking for like toilet paper, you looked up there, toilet paper,

[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:41.200]
Al 7.

[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.680]
You wanted this spaghetti sauce.

[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.780]
Spaghetti, yeah, yeah.

[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.180]
I'll six, whatever it was.

[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.320]
And you go into these gigantic places.

[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.860]
Is there such a thing anywhere around?

[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:50.000]
No.

[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.580]
So I'm wandering around, wandering around, and some guy who's a listener.

[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.980]
I need a how-how-I-SNA, great, you know, where, where are they?

[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:55.980]
I'm going to find toilet seats.

[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:56.620]
Oh, all right.

[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:57.920]
There's not a very good selection left.

[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.700]
There's not too many left, but they're in the aisle 14.

[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.080]
Because this place is going out of business.

[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.080]
They're selling everything out.

[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.360]
Why would builders swear to be going out of business there?

[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.140]
Hold the deep hose.

[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.020]
Oh, a lot of business.

[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.120]
Like I said, hold the deep hose, putting them out of business.

[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.020]
Just like that came out, it'll be going pretty soon too.

[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.740]
Because Walmart's going to, well, I'll get to Walmart in a minute.

[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.660]
So anyway, I'd go over there.

[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.260]
I'll 14.

[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.940]
I look and here's where they used to be evidently once upon a time a whole lot of toilet seats.

[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.640]
And there's, you know, a smattering of toilet seats there.

[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.880]
But they all of them say regular bowl.

[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.020]
And then I find a box that says elongated bowl.

[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.040]
And I thought, oh, here we go.

[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.240]
And I pull the box forward.

[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.940]
And it's a blue toilet seat.

[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.900]
What shade of blue?

[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.020]
Baby blue.

[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.240]
Powder blue.

[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.560]
A blue toilet seat.

[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.140]
Now, in my case, I guess it couldn't hurt my image, and you okay?

[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.360]
But am I ready quite yet at this stage of my life for a blue toilet seat?

[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:55.680]
No.

[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.940]
And of course, that's why I was still there.

[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.680]
Then they have wooden toilet seats.

[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:05.160]
Now, the last thing I need is to have, you know, wood in my rectum, right?

[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:06.040]
Okay.

[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:13.600]
But why would anybody get a wooden, because first of all, wood, especially down here in South Florida, you know, with a humidity?

[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:14.700]
Wood rocks.

[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.080]
Oh, excuse me.

[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.480]
I've got a little rectum problem.

[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.660]
So to make a long story short, after wasting all my time wandering about 500 yards with the white,

[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.980]
with the space there in Goddamn, Builder Square, I walk out of there with this guy to look on him.

[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.400]
I post like, forget about this, because then they got crap.

[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.840]
So now I go over to Walmart, which is right next door.

[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.640]
I figure, you know, a K-Mart didn't have what I wanted, but Walmart is certainly a step above K-Mart.

[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.040]
Isn't it like a half a step?

[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.620]
A little quarter of a step.

[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.000]
Oh, excuse me.

[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.500]
Let me get this splinter out of my rectum.

[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.940]
But at any rate, so I go in here, and I look around and sure enough within the matter of moments,

[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.440]
I find a guy with the outfit on.

[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.380]
I say, hey, can tell me where I find the toilet seats.

[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.400]
Go to the red line and make a right.

[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.160]
Didn't even look up.

[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.460]
Go to the, okay, I go to the red line and make a right there they are.

[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.700]
And you know what, I look at them and they're all like little baby toilet seats for little baby toilets.

[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.300]
And people with little small baby rectums, I guess.

[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.460]
But just as I'm ready to walk out and I'm thinking,

[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.940]
she's not going to have to go to another place to get a goddamn toilet seat.

[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.280]
I mean, why should you have to spend this much effort?

[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.080]
And I look down there on the bottom, kind of off in the corner.

[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.460]
And here's two of them that say for full, for elongated bull.

[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.940]
It's got like a sticker on the front of it for elongated bull.

[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:32.700]
And sure enough, I, you know, there was like a selection of colors white or white.

[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.740]
Yeah, that was the selection of colors.

[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.360]
Either a white one or a white one.

[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:43.440]
So I got a white one for what?

[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.700]
What, what, what are I going to do?

[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.020]
Am I going to, you know, this isn't something I'm going to spend my whole life on, okay?

[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.100]
So for $16.99, I get me a white toilet seat.

[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.060]
And I take it home.

[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.360]
And of course, the toilet is not white.

[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.420]
The toilet is like beige, almond, whatever they call it, you know.

[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.540]
And most houses in apartments, they got like either white or almond or,

[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.840]
and real fancy, schmancy place black maybe for like refrigerated.

[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:07.880]
It's almond.

[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.340]
So I put the thing on there and I scoot all in.

[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.740]
And it fits, it's lovely, but it looks, you know, looks a little goofy.

[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.000]
A white toilet seat on an almond toilet.

[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.740]
But I got me a toilet seat.

[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:23.060]
Oh!

[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:23.820]
No, no, seriously.

[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.000]
So what I'm going to do is when I have some time, I'll figure out, I guess I'll go to Home Depot.

[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.060]
Would that be the logical move?

[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:34.060]
That'll be my next, it'll only be a tense, that process, getting your guy to the toilet seat.

[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.580]
And I'll go over to Home Depot.

[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.580]
I'll mose you on over there.

[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:41.520]
And I'll see if they have like any elongated, in an almond color, one that actually matches the bowl itself.

[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.660]
And I'll take this one, I'll do the same I did with the first one and throw it away.

[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.540]
Oh, you're not going to take it back?

[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.180]
No, I'm not.

[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:48.620]
No.

[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.240]
So that'll be $27 worth of toilet seats that I will have thrown out.

[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.080]
Huh?

[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.540]
Hey, listen, when you got it, easy, come, easy, go.

[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.900]
Okay, I'm not going to take it back.

[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.600]
I'd rather throw it in the dumpster than take it back.

[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.540]
I would say anything under $20.

[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.460]
If I buy something under $20, and if it doesn't work out, I just toss it.

[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:19.280]
And I'm not going to take it back and go standing online and go through a big swan in the dance like those jackasses that go to Eckerds and stand online and make everybody else's life miserable for refunds.

[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.100]
Can't do it.

[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.200]
So the mystery of the toilet seat is solved if that's taken care of.

[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:25.660]
There's one.

[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.020]
Let's take a call in mobile in Coconut Creek.

[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:29.360]
Hello?

[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.360]
Hey, Neil, how you doing today?

[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.620]
Hey, listen, I'm a kitchen designer at Home Depot.

[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.320]
It's funny you were just talking about that.

[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:36.680]
Yeah.

[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.980]
And one I wanted to say happy new year to you.

[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.740]
Your show is a great show.

[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.820]
I really enjoyed the show.

[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:46.100]
Great service to this community, no matter what that little tour of Buddy Nevin says.

[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.840]
Hey, listen, what you were saying about the Boulder Square, they are going up because we're buying them all out.

[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:53.380]
Yeah.

[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:54.120]
Okay.

[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.880]
But couldn't you have waited another month or two so they had a better selection of toilets?

[00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:58.500]
Sorry.

[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:04.540]
But listen, here's my guaranteed promise to, if you were to ever come over to my store, I'm at the Copen store.

[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.620]
Copen's in 95.

[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:06.500]
Oh, no chance.

[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:06.720]
No.

[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.060]
No.

[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.040]
Just listen.

[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:08.380]
Yeah.

[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:14.700]
Here's my promise to you, if you ever come over here and you need any help whatsoever, you come to see David in the kitchen department.

[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.080]
Yeah.

[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.720]
I'll personally walk you around the store and service anything that you need.

[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.100]
You'll service me in the store, yeah.

[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.300]
Well, I don't know about you.

[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.120]
I have a guy that maybe will service you, but I don't know.

[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.760]
It wasn't a long-gated bull.

[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.260]
It wasn't a long-gated foul.

[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:29.560]
Uh-huh.

[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.040]
Alrighty.

[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.260]
Well, there's nothing wrong with having something along you to do, but it's not the bull ahead mine.

[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.500]
Okay, David, have a great new year.

[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.700]
Yeah, thank you, you too.

[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.860]
I'll be seeing you real soon up there on Copen's Road, won't I?

[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:38.080]
No.

[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.760]
Okay, we have an open line of day one and an hour, five, six, seven.

[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.560]
Also, the other thing I want to get to an assistant's on today since these people are like pretty boring.

[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:49.120]
I want to find out about my passport because the people from the passport office in Miami a few months ago,

[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.740]
sent me the renewed by mail thing.

[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.400]
I don't want to renew my passport by mail.

[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.280]
I want to go over to my mailbox, place and get a couple of passport photos, and then go like,

[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:03.620]
there are within the first week of the new year, meaning next week one day, I want to go over and do it in person and get my passport renewed immediately,

[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:08.560]
because it's not something that I feel comfortable kneeling off and waiting for it to come back to the new one,

[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.240]
because of the way things are going in this country right now, you have to keep your passport,

[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:18.420]
you have to be clutching it at all times, you have to have it in your hand as much as possible in your passport, too.

[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:22.440]
Okay, so maybe we'll get some advice on that, because I don't even know where to go anymore,

[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:27.420]
because when I originally got my first passport, it was in Hollywood somewhere, a Hollywood post office,

[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.280]
I don't know where, I don't even know where I have no idea.

[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:36.100]
But somebody will know, some ace out there will know the information, because I'm not going to mail it,

[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:40.340]
and I appreciate the fact that you sent me all that stuff to mail it in, I know you can do it, I'm not going to do that.

[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.980]
I want to go down here, get it right in my fat little hand.

[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.220]
22 before 11 at 560, WQA, and...

[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:52.080]
Where did you find it, Kaplan? Right where you got it?

[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.480]
Sports radio, 560, QAF.

[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.300]
You get a lot of things.

[00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.600]
Fire!

[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.800]
You're a Roger's R-Sports whole radio, WQAF.

[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:12.160]
Next time on Martha Stewart Living, Martha gets busy with Hank, the lawn man.

[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:17.660]
Now we'll head out to the West lawn. Hank's been trimming around my hedges for several years now,

[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:21.460]
and today he's going to show us the perfect way to think of post.

[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.440]
I'm just starting to go with Cedar Post.

[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.940]
That's a nice, sturdy post, Hank.

[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:31.900]
Well, thanks, Mrs. Stewart. First, you make sure your holes all say, oh, it is, Hank.

[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.400]
Then you slide, you post in, and begin packing it in good.

[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.040]
Keep her, Hank. Keep her.

[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:41.220]
Trying to hear Mrs. Stewart, the next time for Martha Stewart Living.

[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:47.560]
Okay, 1042. 1042.

[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.980]
I have 550 WQM Bill Zimprobe for Hank.

[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.680]
He's working hard in New York with Martha, I guess.

[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.760]
Here's North Miami. Hello.

[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:55.800]
Hello?

[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:56.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.200]
Hi, Neil. How are you?

[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.120]
Great, happy New Year.

[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.860]
Thank you, St. Pee, which is one of the reasons why I called you.

[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.600]
I have for months of y'all. I come down every winter.

[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.660]
And I wanted to wish you a happy anniversary, because I recall last year having heard you,

[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.960]
and I thought you were one of the most refreshing, and delightful people have had the pleasure of listening to it in my life.

[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.780]
Well, that's what Dick Irving Jr. says. He's my number one fan, by the way.

[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:14.720]
I guess he is.

[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:15.360]
Yes, he is.

[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.080]
I wish you were syndicated in Canada.

[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.940]
So do I. I'd be big in Toronto.

[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.880]
The frogs in Montreal might not like me too much. I'd be big in Toronto, eh?

[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:28.860]
Well, I'll tell you what, Neil. The only reason why Stern was removed from the air in Montreal was it was all politics.

[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.540]
They said it was because Fox had a neighboring station coming in every Saturday night.

[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:38.040]
B.S., they had a lot of nonsense going on versus the French, and they were sort of thing.

[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.960]
But in the end, they didn't have to pull them off the air.

[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.640]
And I think that you're a much better...

[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.620]
I think they took them off in Montreal because he spoke English.

[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.980]
I think that would happen. That's all you need to do.

[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.680]
No, true. As a matter of fact, Neil, it's a very unknown fact.

[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:53.140]
But Jeff is Montreal is the second largest French-speaking city in the entire world.

[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.580]
Would you believe it's also the second largest English-speaking city in Canada?

[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.700]
So you know what? There's plenty of room for everybody irrespective of the problems.

[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.920]
I think you're one of the most knowledgeable people that I've had the pleasure of listening to,

[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.380]
and you're also surprisingly knowledgeable when it comes to hockey.

[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.900]
Well, what do you mean surprisingly, Neil?

[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:09.620]
It's more than the American.

[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.800]
It's just that official hockey.

[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.580]
And I think you're probably more knowledgeable and most Canadian people when it comes to that.

[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.140]
Well, now you're getting carried away.

[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.700]
No, I'm serious, Neil.

[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:25.920]
I listen to... We have a show in Montreal on the radio station CICUC AM600, Mitch Mellick.

[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.280]
And he's well aware of what you're all about.

[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:33.220]
And he enjoys you furthermore. I pick you up on the internet every day between 10 and 2.

[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:33.560]
Excellent.

[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.920]
Well, also we're going to be having a say on to Danny Galavan a little bit later on today.

[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:37.900]
Oh my god.

[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.900]
Danny's going to be on the radio.

[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:43.340]
And also Bill Huitt's going to be on Foster Huitt's going to be in one or two hour, yeah.

[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:51.660]
Neil, I just wanted to say Danny Galavan will probably along with Foster Huitt go down and probably use already immortalized in the anals of hockey descriptions.

[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:59.380]
We've enjoyed him way back when, and although I'll tell you, I lost interest in terms of attending games because the places are just unapportable.

[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.160]
Neil, you can go to the Moshe Center, which is a replacement of the old form.

[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.920]
And I promise you, for two people, to park the car, have a little snack and sit down and sit in the top seats.

[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.980]
You're talking between two and two fifty for a night. That's an alien, but still too.

[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.700]
Especially for all those teeth problems, they won't put up the gun.

[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.560]
Well, wait till you see the new air Canada Center, by the way, it's beautiful.

[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.520]
Looks right on the outside. I haven't seen the inside yet.

[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:27.640]
Well, you know what's funny? They say it's going to replace a monumental place in Maple Leaf Gardens and probably will.

[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.960]
But you know what, Neil? The truth is I was there last year. It was a barn.

[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.700]
It wasn't like the form. The form had been refurbished.

[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.600]
What was a barn? The Maple Leaf Gardens?

[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.240]
Oh my God. I can't believe you said that. I go there all the time.

[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.520]
So it is not a barn. It's still got all. I can't believe you said that.

[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.560]
Now you're letting your allegiance get in your cloud.

[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.440]
I don't know what I was at. Maple Leaf Gardens is the greatest place in the world.

[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.000]
Neil, were you ever after refurbished for my favorite?

[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.680]
I've never been to Montreal. I don't go. There are too many fronds there.

[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.620]
Neil, the truth of the matter is I won't go into the whole politics.

[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.440]
You're closing, yes.

[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.020]
But I will tell you this much.

[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:04.100]
The growth of a corporate entity of Canada, but Montreal is still, it's like comparing...

[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.740]
I guess that people are feeling out of there like they got bad B.O.

[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.440]
Which I think they will.

[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.620]
Have a great New Year, pal.

[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.380]
Neil, all the day after reaching Hollywood.

[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.600]
Thank you very much. Get out of here.

[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.360]
Oh my God. Maple Leaf Gardens is a barn this man.

[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.900]
Oh Jesus. Well, it's no macarena. I'll tell you that.

[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:23.600]
Can't even cover up the goal lights there. When a goal scored, you actually see the goal light come on here.

[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.300]
Maple Leaf Gardens. What's wrong with those bastards?

[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:30.300]
Where we going? I can't believe. How did I leave him on that long when he was ripping Maple Leaf Gardens?

[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.660]
Here's a mobile in Fort Pierce. Hello.

[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.620]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.200]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.800]
Congratulations on your year.

[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.200]
Thank you. It's one year today.

[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.180]
December 30th.

[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.520]
I want time really flew by. Do you believe that?

[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.140]
Yeah, I got a take on this ticket situation.

[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.420]
On the dolphin tickets?

[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.280]
Yeah, I am.

[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.400]
On the 13,000 seats that still aren't sold out.

[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.840]
And people are calling. Well, they got him in the upper corner.

[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.300]
You know, I mean, what kind of lane crap is that?

[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:57.980]
Well, you know, the year morning guys have just spin-masters, I think, for the dolphins' organizations anyway.

[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.860]
But they were, I went through Jacksonville.

[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.660]
They didn't have a spin-it.

[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.600]
The tickets there are playoff tickets, a regular price.

[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.040]
Get that regular price.

[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:07.340]
No, no, no.

[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:11.220]
The league, the league, your answer, the league. In fact, I heard Dave Evans under this morning.

[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.120]
The league sets the prices for the playoff tickets.

[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.040]
You believe that guy?

[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.780]
Yes. I don't.

[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.140]
But.

[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.420]
What do you mean you don't? How could he come on the ear?

[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.900]
How could he go on the ear and say that if it weren't true?

[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.780]
I mean, I know people lie through their teeth. But how could he make a statement like that if it weren't true?

[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.480]
The league sets the prices for playoff games.

[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.220]
Well, how come Jacksonville was regular price?

[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.400]
You know, there's got to be, there's something going on here.

[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.760]
You know, high-zinga must be tight for money.

[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.920]
But I, you know, the other challenge is going to be...

[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.000]
The other challenge is going to be...

[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.920]
The things are really tough at the high-pinga house.

[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.900]
He may not be able to have a New Year's Eve party this year, things are so tight.

[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.080]
He may have to go over to Buddy Nevin's house and celebrate.

[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.820]
You got to try some hair transplant, man.

[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.020]
Yeah.

[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.940]
You know, hey, but anyways, no, yeah, in Buffalo, you're...

[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:50.740]
Maybe he's got wooden splinters in his back, though.

[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.480]
That could be his problem.

[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:51.820]
Yeah.

[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.140]
Buffalo for their big game against the Jets two weeks ago.

[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:54.480]
Yeah.

[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.180]
There was about the same number of seats left.

[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.240]
And I challenged Wayne and I, Zinga just like Ralph Wilson did.

[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.020]
He bought up.

[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:00.800]
Yes, I saw that.

[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.440]
I saw that. And by the way, speaking of that, I want to tell people that have the small dish.

[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:14.880]
If you want to learn what a real great sports TV network is, watch Channel 313, watch Empire, watch Fan TV on there, watch the job that they do before the Sabers game.

[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.520]
I mean, that is a great, great sports network, Empire in Buffalo.

[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.840]
My robot guy is very good.

[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:20.160]
Right.

[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.440]
You know Mike, right?

[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.500]
I don't know him, but I know who he is, of course.

[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:27.640]
I mean, he talks, he'll come down in the organization now like these butt kickers down here, you know?

[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.640]
I will say one thing for my robot guy is better. He got better lips than Luke.

[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.940]
Hey, I got a question for you.

[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:32.640]
He'll let those fog lips.

[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:34.880]
Oh, he ain't no real.

[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.980]
Was he born with a frown on his face or is that just after every play from Scrimitz?

[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.900]
That's after he looks over and sees that Jimmy Johnson's the coach he starts from.

[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.180]
And have a great New Year pal, huh?

[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.940]
Oh, gee, they just spilled water all over the place.

[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.560]
Well, most of these last couple of calls.

[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.200]
I almost got it.

[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.980]
I got my finger on the, don't worry about it.

[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.280]
Okay, I'll take care of it.

[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.320]
I got lots and lots of towels here.

[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:56.020]
Relax.

[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.440]
It's our one year anniversary.

[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.720]
I'll get a little bit to excited.

[00:38:59.000 --> 00:38:59.180]
What?

[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.800]
No, I did not spill it in the board.

[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.240]
I spilled it off to the side.

[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.180]
See, I'm not like what's his name there.

[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:05.480]
You're good friends. Steve Noesring.

[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.260]
Wasn't Steve Noesring?

[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:08.540]
That's still all the stuff in the board there.

[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:10.460]
No wonder they're a golf doctor pepper.

[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.100]
Yeah, but big, a big golf doctor pepper.

[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.720]
No wonder it's broken.

[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.780]
It's like poison, huh?

[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:17.860]
Now, she hates everybody.

[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.200]
Well, that's always somebody else's fault.

[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.980]
Maybe that's why her show sucks, though, man, because everybody else in the world makes

[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:22.540]
her show suck.

[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.620]
Makes her sound like a jappy obnoxious yenta from New York, with that phony put on thing

[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:28.220]
of hers, okay?

[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.060]
So the Rick and Fred's story, I hope you're spreading the word about that, because it's not a story.

[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:32.920]
It happens to be true.

[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:37.060]
And by the way, I don't tell that I don't tell you that story with any great, with any degree

[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:40.440]
of enthusiasm, because I wish them only the best of luck.

[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.580]
They're good guys, even Rick.

[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.140]
And I wish them all the luck in the world.

[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.320]
And of course, being locked in there with queer channel, they'll need it.

[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:48.580]
And being involved in any way, shape, or form with Pete Bouldier.

[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:49.820]
See, let me just tell you this.

[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.580]
Here's a message for Rhonda Wolfe over there, queer channel, okay?

[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.200]
Rhonda, I know you like me a lot.

[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.180]
You respect my talent.

[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.480]
You kiss my ass if I could work over there.

[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:00.660]
But the fact that you got a guy like Peter Bouldier is your henchman.

[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:04.220]
This tells me that you, you know, you guys over there haven't got a clue.

[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.280]
In addition to what she does make any difference anyway.

[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.180]
Because every queer channel station in America blows.

[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:15.780]
They haven't got one good station on here in the country because they all are cheap.

[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.120]
They put all this syndicated garbage on there.

[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.380]
They got Dr. Laura.

[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.120]
They got fat ass on there.

[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.000]
And that's it.

[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.540]
That's all they know is syndicated.

[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.780]
And anybody that they are paying money for the rights to their shows, they're trying to go

[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.380]
to them down to a lower number anyway.

[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:34.220]
So they can give you all a big song and a dance and all the flash that they want.

[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:40.940]
But the fact is it's a real cheap best outfit that even makes beasley read look like the lack of the big spenders and that.

[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.500]
Doing that is almost impossible.

[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.860]
No, seriously, we never believe that that could be possible.

[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.060]
Clear channel, cheap obnoxious, destroying people's lives.

[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:50.820]
And what did I tell?

[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:55.540]
What did I go on here and say three, four years ago when I started when the FTC relaxed the rules.

[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.820]
And they allowed just a handful of companies to buy up all the stations.

[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:03.340]
I said it would be bad for the people in a business and would even even be worse for the audience.

[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:09.500]
No more creativity, no more originality, no more paying people a big bucks to bring in some serious talent.

[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:15.260]
Now let's just open up a pot and put some syndicated crap on there and see how many spots we can sell.

[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.500]
And that's what it's all about.

[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.540]
Here's a mobile in North Miami.

[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:20.880]
Hello.

[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:22.500]
Hello.

[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.520]
Yes, I am.

[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.320]
How are you doing?

[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:25.700]
Great.

[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:26.540]
Good.

[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:27.700]
Love you, show.

[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:28.820]
Happy anniversary.

[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:29.680]
And the same views, sir.

[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:30.240]
Happy New Year.

[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.900]
Happy anniversary, whenever that case.

[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:38.060]
Hey, I just want to tell you about that builder square that totally made me laugh because that place deserves to go out of business.

[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.860]
That is the worst store you ever go to.

[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.060]
Not just because they're going out of business.

[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.100]
No, you mean that particular one or all?

[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.180]
No, that particular one.

[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.500]
Nobody knows they're asking them a whole new ground in that place.

[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.600]
You couldn't get a straight answer out of anything.

[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:58.760]
It's a good thing I ran into that one guy who knew me in the place because if I went to run into him, I think I'd still be walking around.

[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.180]
You can't find anything in there.

[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.340]
It's just a mammoth junkyard.

[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.680]
You must better go into the home depot anyway.

[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:05.060]
Okay.

[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:06.180]
Throw the toilet.

[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.760]
Maybe I know how people collect stamps and coins.

[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.580]
Maybe I should just start collecting toilet seats.

[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:14.980]
Oh, you make me laugh.

[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.540]
Because if I could go back in the dumpster, I got the original one that's real.

[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.860]
I got the one that I, a little baby, when I bought a cameart.

[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:22.040]
I got the one from Walmart.

[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:22.700]
That's three.

[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.500]
When I get my new one, I'll have four.

[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:28.040]
If you're not too many other people in America, you have four toilet seats for the same toilet.

[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.720]
I just pictured you down there changing the seat.

[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.780]
That made me laugh.

[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.560]
You down on the other hand and knees in your bathroom changing the rim.

[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.060]
Believe me, after somebody shows some days, I go into bathroom and I'm on my hands and knees all right.

[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.220]
Listen, have a great new year pal.

[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.000]
You too.

[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:42.460]
See you.

[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:42.820]
Bye.

[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.180]
Okay, we have an open line and day one in Broward.

[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:45.320]
Bye.

[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:45.720]
Like today.

[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.420]
It's our one year anniversary on this station.

[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.580]
I don't know any words all our friends today.

[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.840]
Happy anniversary, Neil.

[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.840]
We love it by that's it.

[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:52.700]
That's all it takes.

[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.440]
They don't care enough to send their very best to send their very worth to take one moment

[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.700]
out of their busy busy day.

[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.700]
They're not busy doing anything in this town.

[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.740]
See, that's the excuse.

[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.520]
Oh, well, I'm so busy.

[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.240]
I don't have time.

[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.120]
Doing what?

[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:07.600]
Doing what?

[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.700]
Going to the saw-granting.

[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.720]
How many illegal aliens just came in on a bus?

[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.960]
Don't tell me you're busy doing something in this town.

[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.160]
There's nothing to do here.

[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.180]
You play golf.

[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:18.940]
You play tennis.

[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:19.700]
You play tennis.

[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:20.480]
You play golf.

[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.060]
You go to the saw-grants.

[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.380]
You go to a ball game.

[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:24.380]
Not that you have any interest.

[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.720]
But at least it's getting out of the house.

[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:26.740]
That's it.

[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.520]
You go to South Beach and get stone.

[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.240]
You watch the drug addicts posing down there.

[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:31.180]
That's it.

[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.380]
Oh, well, we're hanging out at Cocoa Walk.

[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:34.980]
Great.

[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:35.960]
That's pretty exciting.

[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.020]
Oh, man.

[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.320]
And what's that plastic place up there in Bokorak and everything of the name of?

[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.680]
What is that damn place up there where there always, uh, whatever that place is?

[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:45.380]
It's another restaurant.

[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.640]
It's another one of these joints.

[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.060]
What is it?

[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:48.760]
In Bokorak?

[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:49.340]
You don't know either.

[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:49.880]
You never know.

[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.180]
I always ask you this and you never know.

[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.180]
Don't go to the Bokorak.

[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.300]
Well, I don't either, but there's a place up there.

[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:55.820]
Don't you remember David Day of Paramedic?

[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:57.320]
Remember him?

[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.500]
I remember him.

[00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.660]
I haven't heard from him in a long time.

[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.860]
Is he going to call wish me a happy anniversary?

[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:02.500]
No.

[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.200]
Of course not.

[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.120]
How about a Roberto who disappeared?

[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:05.900]
We're going to hear from him?

[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:06.040]
No.

[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:06.860]
Did I say any lady?

[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:07.100]
No.

[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:07.480]
Is he?

[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:07.940]
No.

[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.520]
Abandoned like a goddamn stepchild.

[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.560]
That's Neil Rogers, man.

[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.540]
And we still keep fighting the good fight and plug it along and pressing on.

[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:19.820]
And it's vital the fact that they abandon you like you got the kudis or something.

[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:22.980]
Maybe there's kudis on my toilet seat.

[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:23.680]
That could be it.

[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:27.580]
I got an almond bowl and a white toilet seat.

[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.620]
In fact, wasn't that a song by Marty Robbins, a white something like that?

[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.300]
Here's a mobile and sunrise.

[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:33.700]
Hello?

[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:34.700]
Hello?

[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:35.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.180]
Hey, hi.

[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:36.560]
Good morning.

[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:37.120]
Happy New Year.

[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.380]
And happy birthday to me.

[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.940]
And happy birthday to your birthday today?

[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:42.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:43.800]
Well, how do you like that?

[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.680]
And I got your tapes and they were great.

[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.000]
Great.

[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:54.300]
And the answer to your question is, your city hall and plantation does passports now.

[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:55.380]
It's not on paper.

[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.180]
Yeah, there was not on paper about two or three weeks ago back about it.

[00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:58.880]
Are you serious?

[00:44:59.580 --> 00:44:59.940]
Serial.

[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:04.100]
Now, how does that do you have any idea how that works if I get my past, if I take my present passport

[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:07.480]
and I got my new passport photos, can I go in there and get it like in one day?

[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.160]
I think I have no idea.

[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.660]
I saw it in the paper because I knew you had mentioned the fact about four months ago that was coming up.

[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:14.000]
Right.

[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:19.080]
And I was, you know, I read the paper and I said it because I know they opened up, they got one up here and brow it somewhere.

[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.340]
Then I saw that in the paper.

[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:20.660]
Excellent.

[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.500]
Thanks for the good news.

[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:22.020]
All right.

[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:22.380]
Thank you.

[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:24.140]
Okay, there you go.

[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.920]
There's the guy that's got some information that I want.

[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.080]
I can go and get my new passport.

[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:28.940]
That cares you for another 10 years.

[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.460]
Oh, boy, I'll tell you any of you walking around out there without a passport.

[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.360]
Well, you must be crazy.

[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.520]
You must be out of your mind.

[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.960]
Your life must be on delay as in Tom delay from Texas.

[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:44.780]
Okay, you must be on slow delay because the Nazis are coming.

[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.780]
Maybe you can hear them marching in the goose stepping.

[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.620]
Maybe that's just the food on the way.

[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.360]
Speaking of food, it's our one year anniversary.

[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.600]
Anybody offer any food yet?

[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:51.740]
No.

[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:52.160]
Huh?

[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.520]
I mean, Joe Rosoli came by.

[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:57.320]
Thank God somebody still loves us now.

[00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.280]
You know, South Falcon was here a couple of days ago.

[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.640]
He brought us a lot more solely water and all that extra virgin olive oil and all good stuff.

[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:04.860]
South still loves us.

[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.820]
Joe Falcone still loves us over there.

[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.540]
And we're off office supply.

[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.220]
We brought us all our new plan or calendars for the coming year.

[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.260]
How many do you bring by the way?

[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:13.540]
Excellent.

[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.000]
Boy, what a great guy he is.

[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:16.940]
Also brought me a couple of new pens.

[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.820]
Keeps trying to spedily that I, you know, they are the I thing, the operation.

[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.260]
What do they call it?

[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:24.840]
Radio carototomy.

[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:25.740]
I don't know.

[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:26.880]
Laser surgery.

[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:27.560]
Laser surgery.

[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:27.940]
Yeah.

[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:30.260]
Oh, yeah, you can throw away those glasses.

[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.700]
You can get yourself, you know.

[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:35.120]
And the meantime, I've got this, this flu virus that's been going around.

[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.040]
I take my temperature.

[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.740]
It's normal, but it feels like you've ever had that where your skin feels warm.

[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.700]
And you go like got achy, achy, breaky joints.

[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.460]
Little flu virus.

[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.820]
It's just, it's just enough to be annoying.

[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.080]
Not enough to go to the doctor.

[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.300]
Not enough to take anything.

[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.660]
But just enough to be annoying.

[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.300]
It's kind of a good way to say goodbye to this goddamn year of 1998.

[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:57.700]
What a year this was, huh?

[00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:58.780]
What, huh?

[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.540]
Well, it had, it was, it had its ups and downs.

[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:07.440]
Had a bunch of Nazis running around talking about blow jobs and stains on blue dresses and all this bull crap.

[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.580]
And that come to find out the Nazis were busy screwing their brains out too.

[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.620]
As if that was some big surprise.

[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.660]
1057 at 560 WQM.

[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.780]
Bill's them for Frank Goldberg today from 2 to 6.

[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.160]
I knew you would know who that is.

[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:20.460]
No.

[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:27.400]
The Neil Roger show now on 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale.

[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.120]
This is the Neil Roger show.

[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.900]
This is your brain.

[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:35.860]
Any questions?

[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.400]
You get up every autumn when the leaves danger.

[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:50.360]
Forget yourself 5,000 in any green.

[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:54.800]
When the flow and leaves the fallin' out of jobs to the US call.

[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.900]
And so that you can get your love that book is free.

[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:02.600]
Then it takes so much time and it's over till it's defined.

[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.280]
You steal it so you're back to my brain.

[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:05.640]
My brain?

[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:05.920]
My brain?

[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.240]
It's a job you can't avoid.

[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.360]
The cleaning got never right.

[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:12.980]
You got to spend your weekends just raking.

[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:16.500]
Because you'll be breaking up the backyard.

[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.800]
All the ain't breaking up your backyard.

[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:24.200]
With the pain you should break in up the backyard.

[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:25.620]
Then it's fine.

[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.960]
Breaking up your backyard.

[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:29.700]
Thank you, Dejan White.

[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:38.100]
How do I always people I mentioned before were sure they're all out of town for the holidays.

[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.640]
I think that must be the reason that they're not.

[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.420]
No, they're not.

[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.780]
By the way, guess what I got to buy the audience to the rest of the day today.

[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.200]
Now we aren't given stuff away on the show ordinarily.

[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.740]
And it's worked very well the last few months we stopped doing it.

[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:51.180]
And again, I think that's one of the best things that happened in the new year.

[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.900]
They're one caller who told me in very emphatic terms.

[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.140]
Stop giving crap away.

[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.760]
Because these freeloaders kill a guy they'm showing.

[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.720]
You know something, sir?

[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:00.140]
Absolutely correct.

[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.980]
And since we stopped, I feel much better about myself as a human being.

[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.540]
Even buddy Niven likes me now.

[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:05.500]
Do you believe that?

[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:05.760]
No.

[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:06.940]
So at any rate, we do.

[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:07.860]
But today is a holiday.

[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:09.460]
It's like almost a new year's eve.

[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.480]
And I don't want these stupid things.

[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.140]
I'm not going to go.

[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.060]
And of course, a lot of you don't want to pay for them, obviously.

[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:16.160]
Because there are 13,000 unsolved tickets.

[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:17.900]
So let's do it by drawing.

[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:19.580]
Okay, about 130 will do a drawing.

[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.500]
And everybody who calls it wants to be on the list.

[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:27.600]
I got my personal pair section 217, row one seats the 9 and 10.

[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:35.020]
And the purple preferred parking pass for the dolphins bills playoff game this Saturday at PPP Park.

[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:35.880]
I feel like that.

[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:38.320]
Wow.

[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.440]
Ray Perry just came in.

[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:41.600]
They're just like hot off the press.

[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.500]
The ink is still practically running on you.

[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.560]
That's how first these are.

[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.780]
And I'll give them away because I'm such a hell of a guy.

[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.180]
Because I wouldn't go there if they if they paid me 500 bucks.

[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.940]
If they picked me up in the limousine, paid me 500 bucks, I wouldn't go there.

[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:53.860]
Because I really don't care.

[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:54.580]
I have no interest.

[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.200]
If they win, they win.

[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:57.280]
Super Bowl, maybe.

[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:57.540]
Who knows?

[00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.200]
And if they lose, what do I care?

[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:05.420]
I'm not going to I'm not going to feign interest and be a late late near bandwagon jumper.

[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.300]
Even if they should want to go to the Super Bowl.

[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:08.640]
I'm not going to be one of those people.

[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:10.760]
It's like the thing with the Marlins two years ago.

[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.080]
Which I putting on a phony act.

[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:17.120]
I had stopped going to Marlins games like the season before that.

[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:21.080]
Am I going to become like a one of those front running phones at the end and jump on the bandwagon?

[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:21.540]
No.

[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:22.340]
No, that's not my style.

[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:23.360]
I'm not interested in that.

[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.120]
It's like a fake orgasm.

[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:27.920]
I mean, you know, maybe some of you are very good at that.

[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:28.920]
Probably had a lot of experience.

[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:30.320]
To me, it's a waste of time.

[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.640]
So we'll put names on the list and we'll do drawing around 130.

[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:35.600]
Okay.

[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:41.020]
And assuming of course that there might be some people in the audience who might want to go to that game for free and a purple parking pass.

[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.640]
How much of that does it have a price on those tickets by the way?

[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.260]
59 bucks.

[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:50.240]
59. Well, I got news for it for a lower bowl hockey game.

[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:52.000]
You got those tickets right here.

[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:52.720]
57.

[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.800]
Is that what you're at ticket say on there, by the way?

[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:56.800]
Look at the price.

[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:57.380]
Zero.

[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.020]
Oh, no, those are comps.

[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.640]
But I'm telling you, lower bowl 57 bucks per ticket.

[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:02.900]
So this isn't too bad.

[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:03.420]
59.

[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.420]
And I have no idea where these are because I never have gone to any of my, uh,

[00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:08.440]
Well, these must be club seats, aren't they?

[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.540]
Yeah, these are club seats, by the way.

[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:10.860]
Woo!

[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:11.740]
Heavy dude.

[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:12.220]
That's right.

[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:12.860]
There it is.

[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:16.360]
Club seats, 217, row one seats, nine and ten.

[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.660]
Heavy duty, baby.

[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.560]
Somebody's going to be going in serious style on Saturday.

[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.200]
And we still have an open line in date.

[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:22.840]
How do you like that?

[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.240]
56705, 60 pound.

[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:26.380]
It's my anniversary.

[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:30.520]
We got a pair of bills, dolphins, playoff, club seats, to give away.

[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:31.880]
Not nosebleed.

[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.500]
Not way up there in the corner that they can't sell for a lover money.

[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:36.680]
And we still got an open line in Dade County.

[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:42.460]
Or somebody wanted us to keep doing all our appearances in Dade County, by the way,

[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:45.600]
even though our biggest and best one, and it turned out to be implantation and our biggest,

[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.900]
uh, borders turned out to be on the last weekend at anybody, up in Palm Beach,

[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.720]
Boynton Beach, in Boca, which shocks the crap out of me, by the way.

[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.420]
If you had any idea how many people up there in Palm Beach are listening to the show,

[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.160]
even what's your name?

[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:56.900]
Wow, wow, wow.

[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.080]
Even Cheap Peer pantalones.

[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:00.020]
I think she's got a pretty good idea.

[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:01.260]
Here's Miami.

[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:01.600]
Hello.

[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:02.340]
Hello?

[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:02.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:04.700]
Hey, happy anniversary, Dade.

[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:05.040]
Thanks.

[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:05.700]
Thank you, sir.

[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:06.760]
I'm happy new year.

[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.060]
And happy new year to you, too.

[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.020]
With lots of help.

[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:10.060]
At least on your enable.

[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:11.540]
With lots of help.

[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:12.500]
And the same.

[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:18.300]
Listen, uh, about the, uh, toilet, uh, seat, why didn't you, uh, go to a promise-apply place?

[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:18.880]
Oh, why?

[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:19.900]
A promise-apply.

[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.900]
Because there ain't no promise-apply place anywhere nearby, then I know of.

[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:25.100]
I just, you know, you look at the, uh, in the book?

[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:25.760]
Oh, man.

[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:26.320]
I see.

[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:29.940]
And I figure for getting a toilet seat, you probably shouldn't have to go to the yellow pages

[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:31.880]
and look in the book and run around town.

[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.860]
It's not, it's, you know, it's a toilet seat.

[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:38.040]
Because some of this places, uh, they even measure you on, uh, the measure you're right.

[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.000]
They measure you, uh, most of them, because they got, uh, hundreds of thousands of them.

[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:43.180]
They measure your, yeah.

[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:43.500]
Right.

[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:44.640]
And your seat, too.

[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:45.140]
Yeah.

[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:45.680]
Uh-huh.

[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:46.020]
Okay.

[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.700]
Well, anyway, how about healthy, uh, happy new year?

[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.200]
And you, too.

[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:50.680]
Right.

[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:51.080]
So, yeah.

[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.400]
Did he say, you, too?

[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:56.440]
We have an open line at day five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound, five, 60 on the 18th.

[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.780]
He didn't want to be on the list.

[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.560]
He just, a nice guy that was already on there.

[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:00.580]
They wanted to say happy new year.

[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:01.720]
And go get your thing, measure.

[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.020]
I got news for a CRIV, too embarrassed to get my thing measured.

[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.060]
Here's, uh, hi, Alia.

[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:06.320]
Hello.

[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:07.660]
Hello, Neil.

[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:08.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:08.820]
How you doing, sir?

[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:09.200]
Okay.

[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.920]
It's, uh, it's a 595 guy with a firm grip.

[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:13.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:13.900]
How you doing, sir?

[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.940]
The guy that nearly drove me off the road in this tow truck, yeah.

[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:16.640]
Yes, sir. Hi, you.

[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.160]
Maniac.

[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.080]
Happy anniversary.

[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:18.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:19.780]
Oh, and the wait a minute.

[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:24.080]
You know, it's funny you mentioned that because I was just telling Georgia about how my right wrist,

[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:26.080]
and I don't have a limp wrist, can spite what they think.

[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:27.560]
My wrist is killing me.

[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.840]
And you know, something I never done on me.

[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:32.980]
The day that I shook your hand is since that day, my wrist has never been the same again.

[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.540]
I think you yanked my thing out of your heart.

[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:35.100]
Come on.

[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.080]
I'm talking to you.

[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:36.820]
Hey, Neil, come on.

[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.520]
You got a grip, I mean, unbelievable.

[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.340]
A couple of things, they ought to be running for governor.

[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:44.680]
Um, uh, well, first thing, uh, happy anniversary and happy new year.

[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:45.740]
And the same to you, sir.

[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:49.360]
Uh, my wife's mad at me because I told Georgia happy, uh, one anniversary.

[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.540]
And she's mad because I never told her Mary Christmas yet.

[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.000]
Yeah.

[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:52.540]
Okay.

[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:53.320]
Okay.

[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:54.840]
Shameless request.

[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:55.240]
Yeah.

[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.960]
Anything you play is alright with me, Neil.

[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:57.400]
Okay.

[00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.080]
Yeah, a good one, and enjoy your show.

[00:53:59.200 --> 00:53:59.940]
I'll see you on the road, pal.

[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:00.340]
Bye-bye.

[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:02.080]
Okay, and don't shake it so hard next time.

[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:02.680]
I'm not handy to.

[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:03.720]
We have an open on you.

[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:05.180]
I'm seriously, this guy's got a grip.

[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:09.020]
I mean, there's some people, you know, you make judgments about people based on their grip.

[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:13.860]
I have like, you know, an ordinary, uh, not a real limpa wimpie, a faggy, uh, thank God, handshake.

[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:14.900]
Not like a wet noodle.

[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.020]
That's bad.

[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.820]
You ever shake your hand if somebody has got like a wet clam?

[00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:18.420]
Oh, boy.

[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:19.020]
Bodleel.

[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:22.260]
Oh, yeah, Bodleel from Atlanta from Cox Broadcasting.

[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:25.380]
Little wimpie guy with little wimpie hand and little wimpie, uh, wet handshake.

[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:26.140]
Clammy.

[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.700]
Yeah, and does he get, oh, he also gives you one of those two?

[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:30.060]
Oh, man.

[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:33.200]
Yeah, I use the same finger, but I did something different with it.

[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.700]
When we left, I gave him one of these when they had that last meeting.

[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:42.440]
Oh, I have better things to do than come down here and, uh, you know, pass along information like this, like we're selling you to Paxton.

[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:46.680]
What an ungrateful little prick he was, you know, that Bob Neil up there in Atlanta.

[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:50.600]
I'm second-tiered to have him do a lot of pretend to kiss their ass over there at Cox Broadcasting.

[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.060]
I'm tired of it.

[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:57.840]
I mean, no, we got some people over there who are friends, uh, friends like, uh, you know, loosely.

[00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.000]
What?

[00:54:59.120 --> 00:54:59.840]
What are you smirking about?

[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:00.400]
It's true.

[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:02.120]
Fair weather friends.

[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.200]
And they're listening right now.

[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.760]
Bob and Chirol over there listening right now.

[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.080]
They got nothing else going on in that building.

[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.580]
And, you know, they've admitted to me.

[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:13.220]
It's his boring is dog pooping at place since, uh, IOD is out of their picture, out of their life.

[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:14.340]
Boring.

[00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:16.600]
They got the coast and hot 105.

[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.360]
In fact, the logo on both stations just shows somebody asleep.

[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:20.820]
That's how boring it is.

[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:26.640]
Even they have to go in and keep poking Johnny Darken the armpit to keep waking him up to read those liners again on the coast.

[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:28.960]
And it's 87, along with Coach Jay.

[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:30.420]
How's he doing, by the way?

[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:31.820]
Is he still an asshole, Johnny Darken?

[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:32.180]
Uh-huh.

[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:34.140]
Here's Parkland.

[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:34.440]
Hello.

[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:36.080]
Hello, Neil.

[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:36.620]
Yes?

[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:40.080]
I just want to wish you a happy anniversary.

[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:40.980]
Thank you.

[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:44.280]
And, uh, one of those listeners has been listening to you since.

[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:45.940]
And, uh, hand, W.S. News.

[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:46.640]
Wow.

[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.940]
Yeah, really back in the days of the...

[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:49.460]
Oh, ho, ho!

[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.780]
The back in the days of, like, Holy Joe and Dr. Jan Bellows.

[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:54.920]
Yeah, Holy Joe.

[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:59.320]
And then all the other guys tried to steal away Holy Joe and I think he met his maker up in the sky.

[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.260]
I think he went to that big, self-beaching sky or something.

[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:02.520]
Uh-huh.

[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.360]
Anyway, I got one shameless request.

[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:05.700]
Yeah.

[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:08.900]
The greatest song since Rick Riley stole my briefcase.

[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:10.280]
GELVY.

[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:10.980]
Okay.

[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:11.680]
Hey.

[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:12.440]
You got it.

[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:13.960]
Okay, that's good.

[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.380]
You know, nobody wants to be on a list.

[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.240]
I mean, that's why I did not sound too many dolphin tickets.

[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:19.700]
Nobody cares.

[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:21.920]
Nobody wants to go even for free.

[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:22.600]
They don't want to...

[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:23.820]
They don't want a chance to win them.

[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:24.840]
All they got to do is sit on their ass.

[00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:25.500]
They still don't care.

[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:26.500]
Which is fine with me.

[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.700]
You know what I have to do is scalp them.

[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:33.100]
Of course, how can you scalp something when, uh, you know, the game isn't going to be sold out?

[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:33.540]
That's it.

[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:34.520]
You know, scalp a lot.

[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.300]
Even if I scalp them for 30 bucks a piece.

[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:39.480]
I wear a exploding bulb.

[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.140]
Oh, GELVY.

[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:47.240]
GELVY.

[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:49.520]
Talking on a sports show.

[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.240]
Trying to be my show.

[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:58.180]
Your voice sounds just like a seven year old girl.

[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:01.000]
A little sports show.

[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.400]
What else are you there for?

[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.520]
GELVY.

[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:06.880]
GELVY.

[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.940]
Talking like a baby.

[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.820]
Who needs a little training?

[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.960]
Why can't you understand?

[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.040]
You don't sound like a fan.

[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.540]
We both so rubber fast.

[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:25.120]
That shows your throat sounds healthy.

[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:26.540]
Healthy.

[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:27.940]
Healthy.

[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.320]
GELVY.

[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:36.120]
Your lovely management sounds healthy.

[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:40.580]
You don't belong there on the air.

[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:42.440]
And healthy.

[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:46.260]
Those sports can wait till your voice cracks.

[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:51.760]
Well, since anyone who sounds like that should find another job.

[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:57.440]
And they should only take you back when both your babies drop.

[00:57:58.140 --> 00:57:58.580]
Healthy.

[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.380]
Healthy.

[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:01.020]

[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.720]
When you're gone and grow up.

[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.660]
You make us want to grow up.

[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:08.660]
You silly, squeaky, blue.

[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:11.820]
Go to your broadcasting school.

[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:14.480]
Your free, new bestest voice.

[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:15.880]
Thank you.

[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:20.960]
Now, guys, I trust your heart.

[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:22.140]
Yes.

[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:23.680]
Your heart.

[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:26.560]
Your heart.

[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.780]
One 15 and five, fifty, giving it to QM3.

[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.920]
I just did it very briefly.

[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:36.120]
The Lambo Elite, Lee Roy Butler, was the first packet to leap into the stands in 1993.

[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:40.360]
And to give against the Raiders and teammate Robert Brooks soared with it the next season.

[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:44.480]
It's not used as much anymore, but any celebration involving the fans gets high marks.

[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:45.920]
Say the assholes, it's sporting news.

[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:49.800]
Who treat all of this as though, of course, it's really entertainment and that we love it.

[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:54.020]
The Mile High Salute, Tyrell Davis and the Broncos brought some class to touchdown celebrations.

[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:55.340]
Were they a simple salute?

[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:58.480]
And now it's seen from Elliott Street to Sesame Street.

[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:02.580]
And of course, Yarr Murjagra and Pittsburgh stole that when he scores a goal for the penguins.

[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:07.760]
The Adirney Bird, here we go, the Falcons foul play has both players and fans in the stands,

[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.000]
flapping their wings.

[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:13.000]
Its popularity has flown as high as the numbers in the wind column this season.

[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:17.000]
And the Adirney Bird, this my fly, my fly right to Miami for the Super Bowl.

[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:19.820]
And it's a no wonder Redance craves his popular with this team.

[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.560]
Billy Whitechews Johnson works in the front office, which brings us to the wobble.

[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:29.580]
Johnson was truly the NFL's first showman, it says, with his touchdown celebration in the 70s and 80s.

[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:33.980]
A dance in which he's scissorsed his legs and rolled the ball up as arms and down his neck.

[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:39.480]
He had kids in school yards and playgrounds everywhere emulating his whimsical moves, how sad that is.

[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:43.820]
The fun bunch, the 82 Redskins had fun all over the Super Bowl, 17.

[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:49.220]
Formed as a sign of unity that receivers would pick up the slack and the wake of an injury to hard monk.

[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:54.220]
The fun bunch celebrated touchdowns by forming a circle, jumping in unison and high-fiving each other.

[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:57.340]
Occasionally an errand player, preferably a cowboy would be caught in the middle.

[00:59:57.340 --> 01:00:04.900]
The fun bunches routine led the league to put in the rule of 1984 that was supposed to limit end zone celebrations to spikes, but unfortunately didn't work.

[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:13.880]
The Homer heave, no they didn't have catchy nicknames back in the 60s, but Giants wide receiver, Homer Jones, is credited with being the first to spike a ball after a touchdown.

[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.000]
Let's take care of him, okay? Won't do it no more.

[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.640]
The right way, Chiefs wide receiver, Elmo Wright, is the granddaddy of the end zone celebration.

[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:30.500]
On November 18th, 1973, Wright scored on a long touchdown pass from Laney Dawson and began running in place with his knees pumping at arm's churning.

[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.080]
He finished it off with a spike and the rest is history.

[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:44.500]
The icky shuffle, the NFL put the kabosh on the dance, the Bengals icky woods performed in the end zone, a series of hops as he shifted the ball from hand to hand.

[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.540]
It didn't matter, we just performed it on the sideline and into the lore of Super Bowl 23.

[01:00:50.540 --> 01:01:04.040]
The boxer, returned man, Vi Sikahima, originated this move with the Eagles in the early 1990s, but only 49ers, a linebacker Ken Norton Jr. had the pedigree to pummel the padding around the goal post standard after an interception return.

[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:09.860]
The California Quake, in the early 1980s, the Cowboys butch Johnson shot off imaginary six guns,

[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:17.080]
a little bit of imaginary smoke and put his guns in an imaginary holster and outlawed image eventually outlawed by the NFL.

[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:27.940]
And of course the funky chicken, 49ers safety, Merton Hanks, employees, Herky Jerky, hit an upper body movement after an interception also known as the Quake and Shake, also known as real embarrassing.

[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:35.820]
So there you go, there's the history of all these very ethnically stereotypical and disgusting.

[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:38.600]
What's Johnson always like, which is what they've been cut about?

[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:41.600]
Here's the mobile in Miami, hello.

[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:42.980]
How you doing Neil?

[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:43.540]
Okay sir.

[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.360]
First time caller.

[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.040]
Swarrow, was you happy new year?

[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.120]
Thank you.

[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:51.820]
I'm in the lovely city of Miami this morning and let me tell you if people don't hear me.

[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:57.300]
Anyway, you can get me out to a Panther game.

[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.320]
I haven't been to the new arena.

[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.160]
I'll get you out to a Panther game.

[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:00.820]
What does that mean?

[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:02.520]
What do you got some tickets or something?

[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.320]
For the Panthers?

[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:04.080]
Yeah.

[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:04.540]
No.

[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.420]
Okay, we have an open line of date.

[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.520]
Five, six, seven, eight, we got a Panther game.

[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.980]
They're playing the bills and the dolphins.

[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:11.380]
That should be one hell of a contest.

[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:14.700]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60.

[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.080]
This overhead blows today.

[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:20.120]
Maybe that's why I'm gagging and choking because somebody is touching you on one of the levels again.

[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.040]
And here's that the problem.

[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.000]
Here's overhead sucks today.

[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.840]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:26.200]
Hello.

[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:27.840]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:28.380]
Okay sir.

[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.440]
I want to take it for the Panthers on the Raiders.

[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.580]
Yeah, can I hook them up with the Panthers in a Raiders' rack?

[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:37.940]
Hey, here I finally got my watch to listen to you because of the Buffalo Bill guy.

[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:38.720]
That's fantastic.

[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:41.480]
And you must go see the Carolina Panthers, maybe that's it.

[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.940]
You know, in a guy guy's...

[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.380]
You're not in a ration in the basket.

[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:46.900]
Yeah.

[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:51.480]
I just want one request to get an listen to all you can eat Negro guys.

[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.680]
Okay, have a great day pal.

[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.040]
No way.

[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:59.360]
We're not going to keep playing the same stuff over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.060]
Yeah, good day after day after day after day after day even though there's the holidays the answers to your evening.

[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.940]
I hope you have a great new year the answer is no.

[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.680]
Okay, let's do Miami.

[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.040]
Hello.

[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:08.960]
Miami.

[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.700]
Hey, it's Neil. How you doing?

[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.220]
Okay sir.

[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.340]
I am a number one Dominican Listerer.

[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:13.600]
See?

[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:14.680]
I'm the own vacation.

[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:15.220]
Right.

[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.400]
And I heard you are listening all day and every day.

[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.140]
And I have a little of my friends listening to you and sending them a go.

[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:23.160]
So I would like to suck up a little stick it if I may.

[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:23.400]

[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:24.440]
Okay, I'm going to look.

[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:27.000]
I can't guarantee the tickets but I'll be putting you on the list.

[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.360]
On a seminar request to you, Neil.

[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.060]
Yeah if you could place into the whiskey into the once key.

[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.460]
Happy new year and couple of eyes.

[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.260]
Okay, I'll jump on.

[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:36.940]
Okay, there's our first guy on the list into the once key.

[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:37.720]
Is actually on here.

[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.720]
Oh

[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:11.320]
Well, now, don't you tell me to lie?

[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.660]
I looked at Monica big fat died.

[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:15.820]
The star-public use I can't deny.

[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.740]
I hate her big inherit by you.

[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:20.380]
Yahoo, who knew?

[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.640]
My president's a juice wasn't squirted on you.

[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:23.640]
Love a Monica.

[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.040]
I'm an old-schooled child.

[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:27.200]
I rolled that boy sick wheeled-ass dial.

[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:28.480]
Nicking out with Monica.

[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.680]
In my limbo, I couldn't have pissed a fat of Ben Bo.

[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.100]
Feeling patriotic, I'm a black hole slug.

[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.340]
I'm a whole door skinnily choked.

[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:38.780]
When she sucked down my bitch fat wheeled,

[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.980]
I started to scream like a old-year family.

[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.140]
Hillary's mad, I'm down on my knees.

[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.400]
It's to the worst kid, Dr. Reese.

[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:46.740]
It's to the worst kid, Dr. Reese.

[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:47.840]
It's to the worst kid, Dr. Reese.

[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:52.280]
It's to the worst kid, Dr. Reese.

[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:56.700]
To be star-report, I really can't cope.

[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.940]
I'm a president, not the friggin' post.

[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.140]
The time is now, and I'm coming, please.

[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.400]
I like my boys with cherished and creep.

[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.760]
The boys on the hill see they made you in peace.

[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:08.080]
All I'm getting sus by that two-time elite

[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.300]
trying to hire a cop freak at these legit.

[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:12.600]
If she didn't spit, they must have quit.

[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:14.840]
When my cronies over in time to blow,

[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:16.660]
I'm trying to kill a reed like an officer.

[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.460]
No, never stop a reed. That's all I know.

[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.320]
She's all get busy with January.

[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:21.760]
No.

[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.040]
It's better than the ones who are near bump.

[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.700]
I might have got struck by that shit.

[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:26.300]
Not a cop.

[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:27.680]
Scared to death, Monica.

[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:28.580]
Take it to the stands.

[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:30.360]
Excuse me, General Bum, Afghanistan.

[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:02.980]
I got a little speaker that I'm ready to azip.

[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.060]
Stalk in its dog, you and Linda Skitt.

[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:05.740]
Checking out the door.

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:05.740]

[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:07.280]
I'm ready to pop.

[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:11.620]
Or everybody, I'm letting my pants be dropped.

[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.960]
1122 at 560 WQM, so the guy that I put on hold

[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.020]
just now, I wanted to hear that.

[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.720]
Happy New Year, sir, but I put him on hold.

[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:20.580]
So we still have anybody on the list, which is good.

[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.460]
Because next couple of hours, how many names can we get on

[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:24.580]
there?

[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:27.220]
So maybe if anybody, maybe just nobody wants these guys

[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:28.100]
to play off tickets.

[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.460]
Maybe that's why you asked, oh, we've got 13,000 sold seats.

[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.800]
Because maybe the interest is minimal to nonexistent.

[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.540]
Is there a possibility that's true?

[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:35.300]
Who's here to be?

[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:37.880]
Here's Hollywood.

[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:38.300]
Hello.

[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:39.720]
Uncle Vio.

[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:40.260]
Yes, sir.

[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.560]
This is an old chronic call, and you wish you

[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.440]
need happy anniversary.

[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:45.080]
Yeah.

[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.560]
I don't know if you recognize the voice.

[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.580]
I'll give you a few minutes.

[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:50.760]
I'm listening.

[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:51.380]
I'm listening.

[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:51.460]
OK.

[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.620]
Now, I don't want to go on the list for the tickets,

[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:57.360]
as far as the job.

[01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:58.060]
Who is this?

[01:06:58.380 --> 01:06:59.060]
This is Stubby.

[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:00.460]
Oh my gosh.

[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:02.660]
He must have had a larynx transplant.

[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:03.780]
It sound like he's stubborn.

[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:04.420]
Oh, really?

[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.420]
I think he's talking about an Argyll soccer something.

[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.680]
That's probably the crappy phone that I'm a happy.

[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:09.360]
Well, that must be it.

[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.180]
That's always a good way to disguise your voice,

[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:12.220]
get a real crappy phone.

[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:13.140]
There you go.

[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.520]
I just got one little special request.

[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.120]
Yes, Stubby.

[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.060]
For our jive and juke and players,

[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.200]
play the complete OJ blah, blah, blah, blah thing.

[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:23.620]
I don't know what you call it.

[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.660]
Have you noticed, by the way, that the not-slanting lady

[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:28.320]
she's a bad-ass and Roberto, that used to make all those tapes

[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.020]
he's a bad-ass?

[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:30.020]
Yeah, well.

[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:30.400]
Yeah.

[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:33.380]
You know, I was sitting around here with nothing to do.

[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.780]
I'm not that busy, so I figured I'd give you a call.

[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:38.420]
I hear you trying about nobody's calling.

[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.920]
Yeah, I don't forget you, my buddy.

[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.040]
OK, I'm always listening.

[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:41.880]
OK, all right.

[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:42.720]
Say hi to Kay.

[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:43.900]
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:44.140]

[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.200]
Remember Stubby Kay's name?

[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:45.680]
Remember him?

[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:46.300]
Oh, man.

[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:47.860]
That's the best thing I've ever said.

[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.760]
Because, you know, I'm saying about four, you know,

[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.440]
and then I was like, well, I get a little food.

[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.520]
And then I tell him, man, I'll do a crazy.

[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.020]
We're saying Rob, we're doing it wrong.

[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.800]
I didn't do nothing with a knife with a knife.

[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.700]
I was like, we're doing it wrong.

[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.100]
And he said it with a ball.

[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:02.300]
You know, they were going to call it with a trying to move.

[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:03.580]
You know, Bob and his head made a little,

[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.220]
Bob said, please, I didn't do nothing.

[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.780]
You know, what I love to do with that,

[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:08.440]
but you know, they made, oh, they should've

[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:09.140]
been doing something to do with the community.

[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:10.180]
So what's up with that, man?

[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:10.980]
I didn't do nothing.

[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:11.740]
I was riding the back of the van.

[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:13.200]
I didn't do nothing with my wife, four,

[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.420]
and I was like, you know, something that I was going to ask

[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:17.280]
to go to my head, you know, but I didn't know what I was going to make.

[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.980]
Because they know that I'm probably going to make it.

[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:19.900]
I'm going to go to my head.

[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:21.320]
You know, I'm saying, baby,

[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.800]
I just don't know what I'm doing.

[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:48.560]

feeling that you were in a bad as i am you in the shower you're staying down you can't tell if

[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.580]

like where you like goes like they were so fat they cracked the seat and i didn't realize it's a

[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:43.160]
life sat down on it and it pinched me and it actually drew blood believe it or not and the reason

[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:47.160]
the reason why i'm sucking around today is at my work you know we have direct deposit you know

[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:51.400]
and uh so you can't on the money to be in there Thursday so you don't have to pick up the you know

[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:55.460]
the check on friday like everybody else well the girl that does direct deposit decided she's

[01:26:55.460 --> 01:27:00.100]
gonna take off extra day for christmas so no one's getting paid to new years and everyone is broke

[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:04.220]

[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:08.900]
of England and some big mansion and uh let's say let's go get him yeah exactly he's raking it

message man of course if it's the fan if you would be it's out there you know no matter where it is

[01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:15.740]
in America they crank that thing and hey you know they they just here they're like automaton's as

[01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:20.400]
soon as that thing goes on hey they're like they react like Pavlov's dog with a little build you know

[01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:25.760]
and it's part of that same syndrome i've been telling you about as long as they keep playing that

[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.460]
and uh you know make a lot of noise and you think you're having a great time even if for what's

[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:35.960]
going on out there is garbage if it is the worst if it's pathetic like most of the a panther home

[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:39.520]
games although it's getting a little bit better now i wouldn't get too excited though i

[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.720]
shouldn't mention in passing you know we beat the islanders in that game five one two minutes ago

[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:48.420]
they were in Tampa bay last night i got shut out freed and nothing i built randford who looked like

[01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:54.900]
who looked like a combination of martin brodour dominant hashik and patrick frog in his best days

[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:59.860]
all put together it looked like jok plant and johnny bowler in their heyday put together that's how

[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:04.400]
good he looked against the pathetic the united islanders if i were mike milver i'd be getting my resume

[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:09.000]
out right now i'll tell you that they stuck so just try to keep it in perspective that's all i'm

[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:15.020]
saying i don't want to pee on our parade but keep it in perspective who were beating here's deer field

[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:20.660]
beach hello i knew how you doing great i just want to let you know that uh everyone my family now

[01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:27.180]
and now has the best of nil cd uh so we contributed two hundred forty dollars to the center one

[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:34.360]
all right so that's good and um reason why i'm calling is i'm a twenty-year-old guy and i've

[01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:42.900]
got a little problem i'm visually impaired yeah and i will i've never done this before um but

[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:50.900]
nevertheless um my me and my dad are big big time dolphin fans right it would be an excellent

[01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:55.180]
surprise to him if i could just be on the list of habits and okay let's give you a shot hang on

[01:32:55.360 --> 01:33:02.740]
hang on thank you you bet okay put him on the list okay in big letters okay we're checking our

[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:06.560]
list in the check it out twice to see all that other bull crap okay and give those tickets away so

[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:09.660]
somebody can actually have a good time because nobody's going to go out there and buy those tickets

[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:13.500]
are they no i mean they just don't want to spring loose with all that money for christay especially

[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:18.960]
and you know a woman called the award team this morning she made a good point of course she didn't

[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:22.240]
want to admit that this is another sports time to begin with the way that she wishes not and the fact

[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:26.980]
that the tv station had a bite of honey games this year at least two that i can recall or the tv

[01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:30.760]
station that was going to be televised and had a bite the last two three four thousand seats so they

[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:36.160]
could televised and not have a blackout however it's also right on the heels of Hanukkah and

[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:41.140]
Christmas and New Year's Eve party getting in the way here in the middle of all of this and uh you

[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:44.640]
know a lot of people are tapped out a lot of people going out there spending a lot of money on

[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:49.500]
expensive toilet seats people are tapped out now so maybe not everybody in the world's got two three

[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:53.260]
four hundred bucks to cough up for the tremendous experience of going out there and watching the

[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:56.720]

seat it's just there it's a part of life it's like the knob on a door it's not something I really

[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:28.280]

[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:32.080]

[01:40:56.100 --> 01:41:00.700]
office to get the tickets until I realized I had 26 dollars in my account but it's pathetic I come

[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:05.080]
from New York and with the dolphins fans all my life yeah I saw them keep the crap as a Jetson 82

[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:12.340]
when I was like five and the Jetson the giant or is that that big AJ do a game yeah in the

[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:18.800]
way the game in the mud yeah yeah they always sell out and I can't believe that there are 14,000

[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:24.180]
some our tickets left for this game I forget the game will go blacked out I don't want to I don't

[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:27.720]
want to pee on anybody's parade but I just I can't see any way seeing the history of the way

[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:32.960]
this town goes how are they going to sell between now and 12 30 tomorrow 13 or 14,000 or even 10,000

[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.960]
assuming that channel 10 would pick up the others they'd have to sell nine or 10,000 anyway

[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:42.100]
it's not going to happen no this is the most pathetic sports and I've ever seen it in my entire life

[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:57.240]
incident that happened to me last week at the macarena I was going to be a Washington game

[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:02.640]
and I'm a seasoned cricket holder I have to you call that a game well you got a point yet but I

[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:08.280]
didn't know that beforehand but anyway I don't always have someone to go with me so I sometimes

[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:14.300]
saw my extra ticket outside the arena for like 15 ten bucks whatever I can get for straight

[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:18.460]
in jail pal I know so I'm very too jail I'm standing there and I'm not really being real

[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:23.360]
obvious and some guy comes up and ask me have a ticket and I say yeah and I say he says I'm I say

[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:29.160]
15 bucks okay so we're just getting ready to he didn't give me a 15 bucks in this this

[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:35.880]
high-vhinga knot he runs up yelling at me you can't sell tickets on this property because it's

[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:40.680]
against the law it's a gas law and so I didn't argue with you guys so I say okay well you know this

[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:44.740]
is actually my friend and I'm just gonna give him the ticket I'm not gonna sell it to him and he goes

[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:52.760]
you can't give away tickets on this property if it goes the law and I you know if I had the

[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:56.540]
guy so I said look I'm gonna stand right here and I'm gonna give this guy the ticket now you call

[01:43:56.540 --> 01:44:01.060]
the cops and have me arrested for giving this guy my ticket that I paid for but anyway we just

[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:05.580]
walked in together he followed me in and I held both the tickets we walked through and he paid me

[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:10.040]
after we got inside I mean it was ridiculous unbelievable sounds like some kind of a Nazi operation

[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:14.700]

[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:35.000]
football is the only sport that this throw you know is carried on and you never see can you imagine

[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.780]
like the mongolans down seven nothing in the eighth inning and Ed Durent the rea gets a blue

[01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:42.400]
single he reaches first he starts shucking and jive no no I cannot imagine that no

[01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:47.020]
why is it just you know you know exclusively football players that act like this

[01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:51.400]
that's a very good question and probably because the national football league is so busy being

[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:54.580]
about your hypocrites that no other sport would put up with it they wouldn't tolerate it

[01:52:54.580 --> 01:52:58.200]
although I wouldn't say this I would say this though the NBA I was thinking about this the other

[01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:03.880]
Dennis Rodman can you imagine a baseball player or a football player dressing and conducting

[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:09.400]
himself like Dennis Rodman no no way no way and there you know there are a lot of people especially

[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:14.660]
white people again who think that he's very entertaining that he's amusing he makes me want to throw up

[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:20.580]
I look at him and he makes me want to vomit with his drag we've seen and his Madonna bull crap and at

[01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:24.420]
the who was he married to for five minutes and then uh-permanently yeah Carmen the electric

[01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:29.240]
electric this you know I can't see what the chick like her was she would a guy like that she didn't

[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:34.340]

the last five years and they went to the Super Bowl four times which is what I can say for this

renewal myth you will not get it back the same day so don't plan on that yeah but how long does it

[02:15:11.260 --> 02:15:17.080]
take there's three way you can renew your passport okay the the first way and the cheapest way is

[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:23.860]
forty bucks why i don't care about okay okay i'm loaded the first way is to fill out the renewal

[02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:31.540]
application and mail it away you'll get it back in 14 days second way is you you take your

[02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:35.900]
money mail it away you got to send the old passport right correct along with new photos and your

[02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:41.340]
money and then and the the application for you have to do that yeah the second way is you can

[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:46.820]
take all that stuff down yourself to the passport agency go through the line and all that

[02:15:46.820 --> 02:15:52.200]
bs and pay an extra thirty five bucks for the expedited fee and you'll get it in the mail in like

[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:57.420]
three or four days oh that's not bad the third way is you can pay someone anywhere between a hundred

[02:15:57.420 --> 02:16:02.360]
and a hundred and fifty bucks plus the seventy five dollars that the government charges for a

[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:06.940]
pass renewal yeah and let them do the whole thing for you i don't want to do that i'm not

[02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:11.520]
trusting anybody else in my passport i got a clutch that thing very tightly well then then option

[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:16.240]
two is your best route i don't know you know in in uh... i mean in plantation city hall is doing

[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:21.700]
a how could there be any long lines for passport and plantation um i don't know how i will do it

[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:31.300]
send it somewhere but they will not they don't they don't think that this is next but i didn't

[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:39.820]
anyway no if you pay them an extra thirty five dollars yeah okay bill then send it to the

[02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:45.680]
now for the table if you still not there for the past for the agency will process it within three to

[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:51.200]
four days and then they'll send it back to you in regular mail which is almost the same thing as

[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:57.640]
if you were to go down to the passport agency and do it yourself but if i send it into the mail

[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:03.720]
i get in fourteen days right that's right even faster if you send them like a bus you have

[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:08.420]

traffic in in documents old documents to prove their face yeah and that's what the Mormon

[02:18:46.860 --> 02:18:51.840]

[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:56.360]
to remember Joseph Smith anyway yeah right right it's that easy name i mean you'll ask your

[02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:59.800]
mahamid all his other names a little bit tougher but Joseph Smith even i can remember that

[02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:04.380]
what was he and one other thing what is the real story with reconciled i missed it every every

[02:19:04.380 --> 02:19:08.200]
time the story is they got fired they were told by peter bouldier they would not be renewed in

[02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:12.320]
feb or when the contract ends they would not be coming back and go look for new job and then

[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:17.720]
Rick came back and asked for another meeting and in a cheerful plea told the people who that they

[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:21.620]
killed a station and they didn't have any mourning show and that they were so great in mornings and

[02:19:21.620 --> 02:19:26.080]
iod and on waxy and yadi yadi and they be willing to go to the mornings and people who said

[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:29.920]
oh yeah you're right we don't have any morning show and he said if you're going to take a big cut

[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:34.540]
and pay uh we'll put you on the morning and they said okay why don't they have good ratings in the

[02:19:34.540 --> 02:19:39.300]
afternoon they're well not good but the best on that station five they were in fact in the last

[02:19:39.300 --> 02:19:43.260]
trend they were the only ones that went up every other day part and that station went down they

[02:19:43.260 --> 02:19:48.220]

[02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:06.060]
voice that does not belong on a radio okay and that laughs and and every time she laughs it's the same

[02:20:06.060 --> 02:20:11.520]

i don't want to get anybody fired in any of these retail establishments but i do want to say this

[02:24:37.700 --> 02:24:43.960]
to you okay my shopping around for a toilet seat has opened up new avenues of this may

[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:49.400]
came art was depressing i mean the woman air behind the counter she was taken her sweet

[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:54.800]
time she was in no particular hurry there was a long line of obnoxious people and maybe that's why

[02:24:54.800 --> 02:25:00.700]
but i mean she couldn't have given a crap less but the people at walmart yesterday i'm gonna tell

[02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:05.920]
you something i have never had an experience in my life and i don't want to get back into a racial

[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:12.000]
thing again i'm not saying because the woman at the came art she was as white as i am and her

[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:17.340]
a service was pretty uh... piss poor and it's even it's even affected my

[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:23.060]
sawgrass publics and it seems that there are certain racial minority people i don't want to talk

[02:25:23.060 --> 02:25:27.260]
about it what it is you know i don't want to be uh saying what it'd be but people that kind of

[02:25:27.260 --> 02:25:32.200]
like hang out and they got the young the young sixteen year old kid he's bagging and the uh and she

[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:37.000]
he's here and she's there to cash here and they be talking and it's like you're not even there

[02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:41.940]
and the scene at the check out at walmart which luckily it was a no long line it was

[02:25:41.940 --> 02:25:45.400]
for the first one online with my toilet seat

[02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:52.220]
and they had a they had a little fun festival and on there at the end of that register

[02:25:52.220 --> 02:25:57.340]
i'm gonna tell you people are managers of these stores who put up with this crap you're the ones

[02:25:57.340 --> 02:26:02.780]
that ought to have your ass fired you know i mean one of the times and i love my sawgrass

[02:26:02.780 --> 02:26:06.700]
publics and every nice to me in there and most of them are really great people but i was at one

[02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:10.280]
point in the express check out because they usually have less than time that day i wanted to

[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:15.960]
find some fish food and take a dog food whatever and uh and and this conversation is going on

[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:20.380]
and uh they're talking about you know he don't want to go out with her and she got a date and the

[02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:26.940]
usual crap that you listen and and she i thought i'm not even there and i give her my twenty dollar

[02:26:26.940 --> 02:26:31.220]
bill or whatever it was and then she puts she puts the money on the counter to change and she

[02:26:31.220 --> 02:26:34.780]
kind of like pushes it me instead of like handing a leak and what's that i don't really care

[02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:38.820]
but she like pushes it in me like here get out of here we're having a conversation like i'm an

[02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:43.420]
afterthought not like i'm a customer not like i'm paying my real god damn money but like i'm uh

[02:26:43.420 --> 02:26:46.140]
and like you're bothering us you're interfering with our conversation here

[02:26:47.940 --> 02:26:52.780]
and then wind dicks you over there on uh the one over when you're i post office on bar at boulevard

[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:57.000]
the one in the uh whatever whatever whatever it was that pleasure called the uh plantation

[02:26:57.540 --> 02:27:00.820]
the town is at the town center some one of those uh two places there

[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:06.540]
i'm going to tell you something they you check out there it is absolutely unbelievable

[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:11.320]
they don't even want to be bothered they like push the here here's the change get out of here already

[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:17.820]
i just go away and you assholes out there that could be your new years resolution the your management

[02:27:17.820 --> 02:27:21.600]
people that if uh you tolerate this kind of crap then you ought to resign you ought to go and uh

[02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:26.480]
flip hamburger somewhere if that's the way you think you will help out a treat the god damn public

[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:30.260]
that's uh you know paying all these over and played at prices for the garbage that you're selling

[02:27:31.940 --> 02:27:36.040]
man so let me say it came art may suck but Walmart really sucks

[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:41.300]
really sucks the kind of people you got working at your checkouts man i wouldn't wish on god damn

[02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:45.600]
a till of a hunt i wouldn't wish on peak boulders or the assassin the kind of people you got working at

[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:51.380]
your checkouts talk about service in this country talking about a bunch of slackards that couldn't

[02:27:51.380 --> 02:27:55.160]
even deflip in hamburgers at burger king because they wouldn't know which side to stick it on

[02:27:55.840 --> 02:28:00.660]
that's how stupid some of these people are you know you just just pay a little bit of attention

[02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:04.380]
okay so we get the transaction right so we know what's going on here so we get the right

[02:28:04.380 --> 02:28:08.320]
amount of change which now of course they have to have the registers that show how much change

[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:12.240]
to give back because most of these people are too stupid to figure it out themselves and count

[02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:20.680]
it change god forbid they'd have to do that but uh let me say it for the eight minute time you

[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:25.080]
store management people that don't watch this crap there's something wrong with you there's something

[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:28.580]
really really wrong with you and maybe that's why some of these stores i don't want to mention

[02:28:28.580 --> 02:28:32.040]
that particular wind dixie maybe that's why some of these stores are like uh you can go in there

[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:36.120]
and it's like a command performance you could shoot cannonballs up and down the aisles

[02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:42.360]
maybe that's why we're interrupting their party is that that could be it think so and that's why we're

[02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:47.900]
interrupting their party oh jee we got a painting-ass customer here jee oh god here here you go here

[02:28:47.900 --> 02:28:54.160]

[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:42.120]
i are going to Venice Florence and Rome and we've got Venice and Florence pretty well worked out for

[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:47.900]
accommodations wondering where you stay or can recommend to stay in Rome and people when they call

[02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:52.140]
with these questions for you but yeah they're really boring yeah uh well it depends on how much

[02:29:52.140 --> 02:29:56.600]
money you want to spend you want to stay in a real good hotel in a very expensive hotel we're staying

[02:29:56.600 --> 02:30:01.920]
in very nice hotels in the other two where you staying in Florence in Florence uh we're staying at

[02:30:01.920 --> 02:30:09.140]
the Rivoli which is four star right down in the uh historical district and then in uh that's more

[02:30:09.140 --> 02:30:17.160]
a location thing and then in Venice at uh denielle yeah yeah i never stayed in Venice you never

[02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:20.960]
stayed in Venice okay i mean never went to Venice but in Florence we stayed at the uh i can't

[02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:24.980]
think of the name of it the very very overpricing the Excelsior i mean the price is a big one

[02:30:24.980 --> 02:30:29.900]
and this is similar to the Excelsior actually it is yeah no it's not the five now the

[02:30:29.900 --> 02:30:34.140]
Excelsior is a five-star hotel is it a five yeah okay well this is a four well they enroll

[02:30:34.140 --> 02:30:39.460]
any damage that's the problem if you want to stay at uh a four-star hotel i stayed in the star

[02:30:39.460 --> 02:30:45.060]
the star hotel metrapool which is uh it's okay i mean it's clean it's not really super modern and

[02:30:45.060 --> 02:30:48.940]
the rooms are small and sterile but it's okay and they got uh they're right next to a couple of

[02:30:48.940 --> 02:30:52.600]
really great restaurants one of our favorite trot the rias downstairs right on the corner there

[02:30:52.600 --> 02:30:57.560]
and it's it's in a pretty decent part of time as far as being centralized right by the train station

[02:30:57.560 --> 02:31:04.700]
okay never been to Venice huh i've never been there that's interesting yeah okay well thank you

[02:31:04.700 --> 02:31:08.700]

March so it's our 10th anniversary so the what the weather should be okay yeah it'll be a little

[02:31:13.900 --> 02:31:17.840]
chilly but yeah i'm really gonna find we're very excited and i want to get your opinion could

[02:31:17.840 --> 02:31:21.400]
have been here i've been here and you talk about it forever so okay have a great time

[02:31:21.400 --> 02:31:26.800]

[02:31:26.800 --> 02:31:31.740]
oh five fifty five sixty by the way don't eat in McDonald's enroll okay please i'm begging you if

[02:31:31.740 --> 02:31:35.900]
you go to Amsterdam you're permitted to eat in McDonald's Burger King Kentucky fry because the food

[02:31:35.900 --> 02:31:40.860]
there blows but don't go to Italy and eat in no McDonald's okay because you definitely will

[02:31:40.860 --> 02:31:46.320]
send somebody after you okay do not eat in McDonald's in a place like Rome and the fact that they

[02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:52.660]
allow them to build McDonald's in Rome somebody ought to be good at okay poisoning the Italians with

[02:31:52.660 --> 02:31:57.680]
the American garbage okay that we continue spreading all over the world all over the world go

[02:31:57.680 --> 02:32:01.960]
to every airport and now we got Burger King and McDonald's in the airport all I'll be honest with

[02:32:01.960 --> 02:32:06.940]
you it beats most of the food they feed you in the plane love my friends in air Canada but

[02:32:06.940 --> 02:32:14.640]
boy your food oh man you want chicken or you want nahi mahi or do you want trouser trout what would you

[02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:22.520]
like just give me home give me off this plane please nine minutes after one at five sixty wq

[02:32:22.520 --> 02:32:25.760]
and hey by the way here's something everybody loves in fact even the max landing lady is a

[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:29.460]
probably she's probably porking up a little bit from the sound of it that you think just a

[02:32:29.460 --> 02:32:33.200]
little bit I don't want to say porking up I mean you know he's probably in a little trouble again

[02:32:33.200 --> 02:32:38.160]
because she's eaten Ben and Jerry's fish food there you go oh if you're gonna get fat if you're

[02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:42.480]
gonna get you know die from too much of that refined sugar this is the way to do it believe me

[02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:47.420]
go out with a big it back when they imbomb you have a big smile from ear to ear and though and

[02:32:47.420 --> 02:32:52.160]
they can put on your tombstone killed by Ben and Jerry's fish food but boy what a way to go what a

[02:32:52.160 --> 02:32:57.540]
way to go that's right in fact if you have a particular kind of digestive system like I do Ben

[02:32:57.540 --> 02:33:03.900]
and Jerry's is even better than pizza lot that's right wow you'll need an extra toilet seat if

[02:33:03.900 --> 02:33:08.640]
you have enough fish food what is fish food with the pH well it's chocolate ice cream loaded with

[02:33:08.640 --> 02:33:12.720]
gooey caramel and marshmallow just stripes and stripes of all that good stuff right through the

[02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:17.420]
middle of it and little chocolate pieces shaped like fish kind of stew all throughout that stuff it

[02:33:17.420 --> 02:33:21.420]
is just unbelievable and Ben and Jerry's continues to make the best the most unique the most

[02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:26.020]
unbelievably great flavors in the world like chocolate cherry Garcia or your regular cherry Garcia

[02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:43.760]
isn't just another ice cream it's an addiction and it certainly isn't watery like that I don't

correcting career what was that oh here it is it's in the people column in the herald this morning

[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:15.140]
in the last paragraph of course at the very ass end Mickey work this this is the crystal ball

[02:36:15.700 --> 02:36:21.040]
for the coming year it says Mickey work roses in actor when he gets breast implants to play the

[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:29.800]
part of a transsexual there you go pretty sad you know that pretty pretty sad fading fading you know

[02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:35.200]
X whatever the hell he was wannabe has been chronic when you become a chronic caulor on a radio

[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:40.480]
talk show that tells you that you're all washed up why didn't he arrest him for saying Mickey

[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:47.160]
might be a few mother I say come over here you suck around not you out that's what I said here's

[02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:52.600]
Davie hello and you know how's it going okay sir and that is pretty sad Mickey Rock calling

[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:57.040]
these shows be him and at the bister chronic son is it like a mother father team yeah I've heard

[02:36:57.040 --> 02:37:02.380]
them before a lot of her bumper team I have a comment a question and then suck around obviously

[02:37:02.380 --> 02:37:07.260]
my comment is my friend worked at pro player a couple years ago and he told me that

[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:14.500]
sometimes they wouldn't flake the number of tickets available yeah to put like fear in the fan oh

[02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:20.340]
that doesn't work here I just know it doesn't work here it's never had any impact okay yeah that's

[02:37:20.340 --> 02:37:23.720]
true that's true we've had I think the last couple years they've had pretty good

[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:27.760]
well no you remember the Rams game and they had ten thousand on soul seats and then never

[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:31.780]
moved I mean nothing happened yeah it is kind of an event driven that's what Hank always says

[02:37:31.780 --> 02:37:35.980]
also there's a joint event driven but which is a nice way of staying a front running for

[02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:42.660]
me yeah in other words if the other team has enough fans down here like a doing the giants come

[02:37:42.660 --> 02:37:47.480]
here or the jets if the other team can put about 20,000 people in the seats then we can maybe sell

[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:51.360]
it out that's true and it's nice to know we're consistent because that goes for the hurricanes

[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:57.240]
and I'm gonna say again here they got this this micron PC a weed lacquer bowl their last night

[02:37:57.240 --> 02:38:02.560]
and they claim 44,000 people in there and I turned it on just for a couple of minutes to see how

[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:06.980]
many people were in the stands and if there were 44,000 people there it's a miracle you ever

[02:38:06.980 --> 02:38:11.420]
know that's what you have planned in it you ever notice how the overhead shot when you got a nice

[02:38:11.420 --> 02:38:16.520]
full stating it's like directly overhead the boom shot was like at an angle where you can see

[02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:21.060]
like one side of the stadium right even then it was like pathetic you know it was a whole upper

[02:38:21.060 --> 02:38:25.980]
deck last night was empty yeah it was it was it looked like a marlin's game as a matter of fact my

[02:38:25.980 --> 02:38:32.260]
question is this whole buddy nevin's thing does he hate your guts because you keep you know

[02:38:32.260 --> 02:38:37.260]
bringing up the fact that it was like one of these bogus stories you had on the radio panel he

[02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:42.280]
just hates my guts period I don't know what the reason being for but he just he despises me and he's

[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:46.680]
one of these phonies in the print media who like to put on an act and pretend that they like you and

[02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:50.460]
they're your buddy and they'll call you and suck around for information and then I'll stab you in

[02:38:50.460 --> 02:38:54.200]
the back like that thing about I wasn't registered to vote which I never said I was registered to vote

[02:38:54.200 --> 02:38:58.220]
right and you know he puts it in like it's a big expose I guess in hopes that it would somehow

[02:38:58.220 --> 02:39:02.580]
discredit me and the audience would all go a diving away because I don't didn't vote or whatever

[02:39:02.580 --> 02:39:07.740]
right this is a stick but that business about the radio pedophile ring you know see and again

[02:39:07.740 --> 02:39:11.980]
that must be a part of it because there was no such ring there was no such story there wasn't

[02:39:11.980 --> 02:39:16.440]
ever any follow up and this guy you know sucked his editors into putting it on the very front page

[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:20.200]
and it just blew up and smoked there were most other people who had gotten canned for that

[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:24.180]
right that kind of irresponsible journalism and now this guy pretends to be some kind of like a

[02:39:24.180 --> 02:39:28.380]
political maven writer that writes basically if it's no more than a god damn political gossip

[02:39:28.380 --> 02:39:32.840]
columno once a week in a sunset no he ought to be lucky works for the hell they tolerate stuff like

[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:39.680]
that let's come send oh come sorry come sendo correct um one other thing do you do you play ACN bits

[02:39:40.620 --> 02:39:46.780]
yeah um I don't know if this was ACN but do you remember uh a bit called indictments and it was

[02:39:46.780 --> 02:39:52.440]
I think a Marian Barry oh yeah a bit that was pretty good if you can find that one and play it uh

[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:58.580]
well the problem is I got the I got oh jeez I just not oh now my toilet say Jesus Christ I have it in

Evan's here like when we were at Ben and Jerry's here a couple of months ago and you drive out of

[02:41:23.320 --> 02:41:27.380]
there and you tried desperately to get to 95 so you can get out of that part of town as fast as

[02:41:27.380 --> 02:41:33.980]
possible I mean Evan'sura is just the meaning age there's 140 I was ready to kill myself

[02:41:33.980 --> 02:41:40.660]
yeah five miles an hour in the big old cattle I can't even see the single variable and in closing

[02:41:40.660 --> 02:41:46.020]
yes everybody over a hundred should drop dead okay okay a lot more room on a highway I'll

[02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:19.700]
there's a lot of a wide open spaces over there or maybe one of those islands they have over there

[02:42:19.700 --> 02:42:24.520]

Neil how you doing great happy new year happy anniversary and happy hot thank you so much

[02:44:11.060 --> 02:44:15.640]
yeah tissue both I have just you know I have to agree with you with this whole uh service in the

[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:20.120]
retail industry Miami it has been absolutely atrocious I mean it's yeah it was never good but it is

[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:24.580]
getting worse and worse and you go you go at any kind of a store now and you finally get to the

[02:44:24.580 --> 02:44:28.260]
checkout if you ever get whatever it is you're looking for and you get to the checkout and they they

[02:44:28.260 --> 02:44:33.140]
are so indifferent and so lackadaisical I mean I mean realize those people are making a lot of money

[02:44:33.140 --> 02:44:38.020]
but uh tough crap I mean if they decided to take the job that's uh that's their decision they have

[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:42.700]
responsibility to pay attention at least hey I worked in the retail industry when I was in high school

[02:44:42.700 --> 02:44:47.520]
and I didn't treat anybody with the time this right I've done the same thing and in this and see and

[02:44:47.520 --> 02:44:53.440]
I mean I was in a in a major office apply store uh you know just recently getting some stuff and I

[02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:58.340]
I saw this man who was bewildered with the printers and he asked this young lady who obviously

[02:44:58.340 --> 02:45:02.840]
worked their walk by and he goes by the way can you help me with these things he goes oh no no you

[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:07.680]
have to ask somebody else I'm just a cashier I just walks away yeah he doesn't even say oh no

[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:12.140]
oh not my mom you know I'll find somebody for you yeah I mean it's just it's been ridiculous

[02:45:12.140 --> 02:45:17.260]
anyway uh another thing I want to tell you about if there was 44 thousand people I know

[02:45:17.260 --> 02:45:21.620]
minority unemployment high high minority unemployment is also a cultural thing so maybe one needs to

[02:45:21.620 --> 02:45:25.040]
the other yes by the way I think the managers are just in fear that they're not going to be able

[02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:28.400]
to fill those positions because nobody want nobody nobody wants to work with the low-end stuff yeah

[02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:31.580]
well I think they're under a lot of pressure you know forgetting a certain amount of minorities

[02:45:31.580 --> 02:45:36.400]
in there in these stores they have to do that EOE thing and the EEO or whatever they call these days

[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:40.680]
and as a result they just look the other way in pretend they don't see it but I'm going to tell you

[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:45.960]
when a place as good and prestigious as my sawgrass public has a bunch of slackers doing that at the

[02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:50.900]
express lane I take great the exception to that that there's no excuse for that you know have a great

[02:45:50.900 --> 02:45:56.400]
one and you two a back full crap of acting like hey and and you know you're standing there and you're

[02:45:56.400 --> 02:46:00.120]
watching it I mean it's not like not like you're doing it behind your back you're standing there

[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:04.120]
and they're talking back and forth and and maybe whoever's doing the back and the groceries

[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:08.260]
it just slap it in there you know I mean they're not even looking at them or paying any attention

[02:46:08.260 --> 02:46:11.900]

[02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:21.360]
maybe it was Mrs. Buffalo Bill here's son rise hello hey Neil yes sir hey um I've

[02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:26.920]
roomed before I got mad my roommate was a manager of public and he would come home every night so

[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:32.700]
pissed off to all those little n words that he had to fire and he'd have to go do stacks and stacks

[02:50:32.700 --> 02:50:39.800]
applications of retarded 15 year olds that wanted a job what a sack of crap yeah I know I mean he

[02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:45.060]
was mad mad mad mad I figured all the colors would drop off as he gave away them yeah but everybody

[02:50:45.060 --> 02:50:49.400]
out they're all replaced everybody's on there all the real colors are back yeah I'm sorry that they

[02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:53.980]
had to put up with like two and a half hours of free loaning all right Neil you're great have a great

[02:50:53.980 --> 02:50:58.740]
new year I've been new here bye yeah it's too bad you know what's the excuse that it be for this okay is

[02:50:58.740 --> 02:51:02.700]
this another cultural thing is that what we're going to be hearing about and I'll say I'm not saying

[02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:08.000]
it's only members of ethnic minorities that do this but I certainly do notice a much greater lack

[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:13.800]
of sensitivity to the needs of the customers you know I'm talking about you get the message that's

[02:51:13.800 --> 02:51:20.780]
right have a bunch of punk kids then they're talking trash back and forth and they're like like you're

[02:51:20.780 --> 02:51:25.600]
not even there like you're the invisible man like I'm remalander something oh there'd be a customer

[02:51:25.600 --> 02:51:30.460]
here but hey so anybody night 730 you know Rufus got to be I mean I'm not interested in hearing

[02:51:30.460 --> 02:51:35.780]
that crap talk about it during the interviews when there's nobody online and especially when you

[02:51:35.780 --> 02:51:39.700]
are the only person online like I happen to be at that express check out a public several days ago

[02:51:39.700 --> 02:51:44.020]
there's nobody behind me so you know bag the stuff giving my change and then finish your conversation

[02:51:44.020 --> 02:51:48.500]
when I get down out of the way here already you got plenty of time to talk BS to talk all

[02:51:48.500 --> 02:51:54.580]
after that's right unacceptable you know and this is the problem living in a country where we have

[02:51:54.580 --> 02:51:59.380]
to pamper everybody if you want to do the job fine if you want to socialize great it's just like

[02:51:59.380 --> 02:52:03.800]
the thing with a hockey game if you want to watch the game if you're there to pay attention fine if

[02:52:03.800 --> 02:52:09.660]
you want to socialize go out in the hallway it's a big gigantic beautiful luxurious place go in the

[02:52:09.660 --> 02:52:17.900]

[03:02:55.940 --> 03:02:59.560]
about how we have to put our strongest talent on in the morning and here's the guy that was going

[03:02:59.560 --> 03:03:04.720]
to blow them out yeah let me tell you what i've been listening to you right around the time of

[03:03:04.720 --> 03:03:08.300]
the film and the rickensaws i don't want to bring all that up again but i guess been about what four

[03:03:08.300 --> 03:03:15.500]
years yeah the radio industry amongst these types of shows to me is so predictable it's not even

[03:03:15.500 --> 03:03:22.560]
funny i mean this this change that he made i mean you know but i can even tell that it's going to

[03:03:22.560 --> 03:03:28.800]
fail right within the first three months i mean it's not going to go anywhere i to put them in the

[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:33.020]
morning that's why i wrote that letter you know i know being the chief as alpha today or you know

[03:03:33.020 --> 03:03:35.960]
they're not going to give them any more support in the morning the i would you give them in the

[03:03:35.960 --> 03:03:39.260]
morning and then they're not going to do anything with them and get in there just their on your

[03:03:39.280 --> 03:03:44.160]
not only that but i mean as as i stated in the letter the competition the competition

[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:48.880]
they were unmatched in the afternoon with the exception of hang right okay the competition in

[03:03:48.880 --> 03:03:53.920]
the morning bomb each they can forget about it everybody's about bob and tom fans with i am so

[03:03:53.920 --> 03:03:59.900]
i'm kind of like torn in between the two but the one good thing is that now i don't have to cut

[03:03:59.900 --> 03:04:03.980]
back to the first team during the commercials of bob and tom i mean we're in here every start in

[03:04:03.980 --> 03:04:07.720]
Monday oh that's good i'm glad to hear that but it's it's just you know it's so unpredictable

[03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:12.400]
it's so predictable and especially like you said put in brook back on in the afternoon i mean

[03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:16.940]
she she flopped the first and again the story which i tend to believe knowing Pete boulder and

[03:04:16.940 --> 03:04:21.660]
his erratic behavior the idea that they ran into each other at a tire kingdom store and while

[03:04:21.660 --> 03:04:25.440]
they're sitting there waiting for their tires to get uh for their rubber to get done no actually

[03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:30.980]
you misunderstood she was changing tires yeah i believe that okay i think he said hey do you need

[03:04:30.980 --> 03:04:35.140]
a better job yeah right i mean i just i listen i believe that if you ever met brook you

[03:04:35.140 --> 03:04:38.980]
totally have a little heart beat yeah i just i see uh

[03:04:44.520 --> 03:04:50.340]
yeah i push the security device in your car and i she happened to come in the control room with

[03:04:50.340 --> 03:04:54.720]
George on that day so i've met her and i'll tell you what all these guys that think she's got that

[03:04:54.720 --> 03:05:00.420]
sultry voice and all these guys that she's some hot-looking woman they've got another thing coming

[03:05:00.420 --> 03:05:07.000]
to them if they actually saw her but uh listen i just wanted to say um as far as these sports teams

[03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:13.180]
go okay uh with the ticket prices and everything i i my phone prediction is probably within the

[03:05:13.180 --> 03:05:18.480]
next five years all pro sports teams all of them will be pay-per-view yeah it could be i mean you're

[03:05:18.480 --> 03:05:22.720]
gonna have to pay the cable companies it's gonna be a pay channel there'll be more sports channel

[03:05:22.720 --> 03:05:27.440]
type things because there's no way they can't possibly squeeze the fans anymore than they already

[03:05:27.440 --> 03:05:32.840]
have they can't raise the parking anymore than they've already have so the only other option for them

[03:05:32.840 --> 03:05:37.880]
and and and the the the the the networks aren't gonna pay certainly anymore than they have especially

[03:05:37.880 --> 03:05:42.240]
for the mediocre crap that we're watching yeah the only other way to do this to have some sort of

[03:05:42.240 --> 03:05:49.800]
of of pay-per-view what do you think well if if they last that long i mean you know the NBA who knows

[03:05:49.800 --> 03:05:53.960]
what's gonna happen with them after this year gets canceled and baseball with these crazy salaries

[03:05:53.960 --> 03:05:58.020]
i think they're gonna see a tremendous family both this year it's gonna be ridiculous and who knows

[03:05:58.020 --> 03:06:02.240]
how long they're gonna last now i know and in a hockey there's so many franchises that are in big

[03:06:02.240 --> 03:06:06.300]
trouble Pittsburgh penguins they they say they can they're gonna play one more year after this

[03:06:06.300 --> 03:06:08.940]
season they're and then after that if they don't build them in a arena they're gonna move probably

[03:06:08.940 --> 03:06:12.840]
to Kansas City whatever happened to them they already failed before whatever happened to them you

[03:06:12.840 --> 03:06:17.780]
possibly getting a piece of the team that that that didn't pan out they still know they go in 25

[03:06:17.780 --> 03:06:21.340]
million and they're still not painted by the way no i know and i'd like to see what's gonna happen

[03:06:21.340 --> 03:06:25.520]
they're gonna have to go chapter whatever it is they already did they went chapter 11 they had a

[03:06:25.520 --> 03:06:29.680]
bar 20 million from a friend from a foreign bank just to meet payroll for the year well listen

[03:06:29.680 --> 03:06:35.600]
and closing i have never called in for free tickets but if you ever have front row for a public
