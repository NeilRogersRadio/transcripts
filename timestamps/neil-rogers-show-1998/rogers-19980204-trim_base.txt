[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780]
White where you got it.

[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.080]
Sport radio 560 QAL.

[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.980]
The Neil Roger Show, Lauderdale.

[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.160]
Here's your brand, honey.

[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.520]
And again, it tastes so crappy.

[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.380]
You know, I'd give my immortal soul for a brand that tastes good.

[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.860]
I heard that.

[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.440]
The Algebra, more than the Underworld.

[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.920]
What are you doing here?

[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.900]
I heard you're not eating your fiber, Bob.

[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.220]
Perhaps you'd like to try a new B. Algebra.

[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.020]
What's so great about the Algebra?

[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.620]
Well, one bowl of the Algebra has all the fiber you need to keep regular.

[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.100]
But the best part is it tastes great.

[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.620]
Wow.

[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.760]
Besides, if you don't eat your fiber, your borrowed will clog with running meat.

[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.740]
Your intrestable full, tensed to his dead.

[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.840]
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.300]
Oh, okay, okay.

[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.100]
I get the points.

[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.260]
So, at least my brain.

[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.240]
There's a good fellow.

[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.760]
Thanks, O Desolate One.

[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.740]
There's no problem.

[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.920]
And now, about your immortal soul, Bob.

[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.260]
The Algebra?

[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.720]
I'm just kidding.

[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.960]
The Algebra.

[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.080]
Because good health shouldn't cost you your soul.

[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.080]
There's smoking it out in the Everglades.

[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.080]
Voices.

[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.040]
Every time you turn around, there's another one coming straight for you.

[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.000]
Your mind, your girlfriend, your body's right.

[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.280]
And somehow, your voice, the one that really matters, gets buried.

[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.560]
But, man, you can't let it stay silent.

[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.020]
And that's why the Air Force could be the place for you.

[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.480]
You'll earn a good salary, learn from a hundred and forty thousand.

[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.220]
What the hell is this?

[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.560]
And, sir, your car?

[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.480]
Well, that's the right.

[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.700]
Well, it's right.

[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.900]
Foster's fault, okay?

[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.980]
What was that about?

[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.060]
He came in here and he said, he would all redden the face.

[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.760]
Well, I guess he wasn't reddened the face.

[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.660]
It's kind of hard for Roy Foster to be reddened the face.

[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.580]
Well, you know what, a black guy gets reddened the face.

[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.760]
You know what?

[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.560]
But, at any rate, he looked embarrassed and he said to me,

[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.440]
oh, you can be talking about my personal stuff,

[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.260]
I said, what personal stuff, you're,

[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.660]
he said, oh, my plumbing problem.

[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.200]
So, we take it back.

[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.380]
Roy Foster, Roy Foster, no, he didn't care about the other thing.

[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.600]
You keep thinking it's about that stuff with that sales broad.

[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.740]
No, he doesn't care about that.

[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.840]
Everybody knows that.

[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.660]
No, he's concerned that people will like,

[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.840]
somehow, this great ex-dolphin player,

[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.240]
whom we all admired when he played,

[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.260]
all of his really badly out of shape in fact now,

[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.280]
and we understand why he tried the act in bed,

[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.540]
because he's big as a house.

[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.980]
But, at any rate, he did not shed blood.

[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.280]
I just made that up.

[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.740]
Not.

[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.200]
We talked about my incident on the year before, remember?

[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.080]
Why, you shed blood?

[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.560]
Right.

[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.300]
And all these people were calling me

[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.400]
and the doctor on the beach was calling me.

[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.800]
Yeah.

[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.860]
But, you're not uptight and sensitive.

[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.380]
And when you blush, we can see.

[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.200]
So, we know when you're offended.

[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.440]
But when we're blushes, we can't see it.

[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.840]
So, that goes for sure.

[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.380]
One more good reason not to be black,

[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.940]
because if you're going to be sensitive

[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.140]
and start blushing about stuff,

[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.760]
how are we supposed to be knowing it, huh?

[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.880]
I don't be knowing it.

[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.960]
God damn it.

[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.500]
So, Roy did not craft black or agreeing.

[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.460]
Whatever it was, purple.

[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.320]
Red, whatever color it was.

[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.820]
Oh, it was purple.

[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.640]
Okay, whatever, just go upstairs

[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.300]
and do what's your name and get out of here, Roy.

[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.340]
Go sell some spots.

[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.460]
Here's your field.

[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.720]
Hello.

[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.440]
Neil.

[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.620]
How are you?

[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.940]
Great. Never been better.

[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.360]
Listen, I just stepped into the house

[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.700]
for a minute and flipped the TV on.

[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.780]
You should hear Pat Rauerson praying for Carla Faye, Tucker.

[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.160]
The well too late now.

[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.680]
Hey, the one that's going to fry.

[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.420]
You know, why should it be any different

[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.320]
for the men than the dish for the women?

[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.300]
Yeah.

[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.220]
You know, you stick an axe through someone.

[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.680]
They're going to fry you.

[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.920]
Has nothing to do with men or women

[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.620]
it has to do with that.

[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.600]
She's born again, sir.

[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.320]
Don't you understand?

[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.260]
She's a born again Christian now.

[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.360]
And how does she change?

[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.000]
So, maybe O.J. O.

[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.460]
You know, see the light.

[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.420]
Yeah, well, that's the thing.

[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.660]
Oh, she's all ready to go meet her maker.

[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.600]
Good. I wish I could pull the switches or flip it for her.

[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.060]
Remember the needle stick it to her.

[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.160]
Yeah. Have a great day, Pat.

[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.060]
See you around.

[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.960]
Every where you go, it's the same old crap.

[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.780]
Bunch of Yenthas.

[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.620]
See, I've got to show you why we have no spots

[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.060]
on most of the day on the station

[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.220]
because most of the people are supposed to be selling

[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.420]
and or coordinating those kind of activities

[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.120]
are busy.

[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.340]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap,

[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.380]
to enter Yentra routine.

[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.640]
So, George tells me during the last break

[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.820]
that he's had several calls from upstairs,

[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.020]
upstairs meaning the power structure of this joint,

[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.760]
where all the Yenthas sit around all day,

[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.460]
finger do it, diddling each other, or themselves,

[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.060]
or both as the case may be,

[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.280]
we're trying to get the stains off their clothing.

[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.320]
And people wanting to know, are you okay down there?

[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.200]
Say anything going on?

[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.440]
Because Joe Castello is sitting here today,

[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.400]
who of course is usually back at the other joint,

[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.460]
getting emphysema from what's in the building.

[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.620]
And he's just sitting here observing today

[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.340]
in case the court since he's the backup,

[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.200]
if we can say that.

[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.880]
In case George is going to be out sick,

[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.280]
which being here today, Joe means,

[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.080]
count on it in the next couple of weeks.

[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.420]
Trust me, he's already planning the days.

[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.900]
But I mean, doesn't that show you how pathetic

[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.440]
and paranoid you assholes and George says to me,

[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.520]
oh my getting fired right now, yeah,

[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.500]
cause he just bought a house.

[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.040]
That would be a good time to fire his ass.

[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.980]
I'll at least do it a circumsides.

[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.560]
I'll say that.

[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.660]
That was only an accident,

[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.880]
but I just dropped my cigar.

[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.460]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.480]
Was it lit?

[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.900]
Was it?

[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.240]
No.

[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.920]
If I'm brushing down there, it's only cause it's cigar egg.

[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.800]
Let's go to a mobile in West Palm Beach.

[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.100]
Hello.

[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.980]
Hey, what's up, Neon?

[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.620]
How you doing, sir?

[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.880]
I got a couple quick questions for you

[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.500]
in a couple of comments.

[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.940]
Okay.

[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.160]
You finally ever heard just before you came over to us,

[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.940]
UAM, and I basically,

[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.240]
look at you, a few times, an open mind.

[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.080]
I think your insight in hockey is excellent.

[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.500]
I think you know a lot about the game

[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.520]
and I appreciate some of the things I hear

[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.120]
in your comments about it.

[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.580]
Yes, sir.

[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.160]
But as far as your other comments,

[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.680]
I mean, I'd rather you stick the sports.

[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.860]
I don't understand why.

[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.920]
You'd rather I stick the sports.

[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.140]
Well, let me say this to you, sir.

[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.080]
Again, I don't do a sports show.

[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.200]
I don't do a hockey show.

[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.560]
I don't do a sports show.

[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.200]
I do the highest rated show in this market

[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.200]
for the last 20 years,

[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.540]
the Neon Roger show and will continue doing so.

[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.320]
Don't hang up on me.

[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.340]
I'm not hanging up on you,

[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.120]
but I will say this,

[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.140]
I don't take direction from listeners,

[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.700]
especially people who don't even know what my show is about.

[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.340]
Okay.

[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.460]
Well, like I said, I came on board with an open mind.

[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.820]
Okay.

[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.120]
But I mean, I've been on the year now here for like five weeks

[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.800]
and it would seem to me that if the only part

[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.780]
that you like hearing is the hockey stuff

[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.200]
which represents about five percent

[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.340]
or most of my show that you would have been long gone by now.

[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.440]
No, no, no, I know that.

[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.820]
I tune you in what's going to be a little bit

[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.720]
because I'm in my car a lot.

[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.180]
I'm in cells.

[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.180]
You know, I do when I hear a hockey I keep doing.

[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.220]
Otherwise, you know, I think you're an ignorant jackass.

[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.900]
Yeah.

[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.320]
And you know, I think your jelly views on daily life,

[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.860]
a lot of them are misconstrued and you just know.

[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.400]
Misconstrued, you know what that means, sir?

[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.720]
You know what that means, sir?

[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.140]
Yes, I do.

[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.140]
Misconstrued.

[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.580]
Misconstrued.

[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.700]
Misconstrued, it was misunderstood.

[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.740]
You know what that means?

[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.900]
You misunderstood a lot of things.

[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.540]
No, no, when you think the views would be misconstrued,

[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.920]
that means that whoever would be hearing them

[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.980]
would misunderstand them.

[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.300]
No, no, no.

[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.300]
Perhaps that's the problem.

[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.900]
No, I think you don't get it.

[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.320]
No, you don't get it.

[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.640]
You know, stick to hockey, buddy.

[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.020]
Goodbye.

[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.380]
Hey, stick it up your ass, buddy.

[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.740]
Goodbye.

[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.520]
See, there's another guy that can't handle it.

[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.700]
Another one of those real nervous now.

[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.620]
He's probably in the closet.

[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.280]
When you're looking to make your neck feel like,

[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.340]
see, to a head.

[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.200]
Something that hurt a little bit of this,

[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.180]
but you can't avoid the morning show when you're in this room

[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.200]
because it's on in the monitor.

[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.120]
But I do avoid it in the car in a way to work.

[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.140]
But anyway, I heard some banter about that abortion last night.

[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.180]
This town is so dicked.

[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.320]
I'm going to tell you right now.

[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.180]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.360]
I have never in my life ever.

[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.140]
If somebody would have said to me,

[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.740]
this is what you're going to encounter.

[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.320]
Try to go to a hockey game tonight,

[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.800]
which you pay good hard, cool cash for those tickets

[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.620]
because you want to go and support your team

[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.960]
and maybe have a good time, which it turned out okay.

[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.820]
And we get on the Hershey highway

[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.740]
and they're approaching the turnpike toll plaza.

[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.640]
Now all of a sudden,

[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.200]
now it usually takes me from my house to the door

[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.620]
if you're wearing the 30 minutes, 30 minutes.

[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.600]
Not my favorite trip in the world

[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.880]
because once you get down here, it gets a little dark.

[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.820]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.420]
A little on the dark side.

[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.640]
But nevertheless, you're parking a lot of the courtier,

[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.540]
you're running for your life,

[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.240]
you get in the door and you're safe, maybe.

[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.260]
30 minutes.

[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.820]
And our 10 minutes of hell last night,

[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.400]
why?

[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.440]
Because this town is dicked.

[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.360]
That's why.

[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.220]
You got a mayor who's on hallucinogens,

[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.780]
number one, every day there's another story

[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.440]
in the newspaper about fixed elections,

[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.420]
which is the one that got a bit in the first place

[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.220]
and they're still counting ballots and they're still,

[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.600]
ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba,

[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.580]
can't figure that out.

[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.380]
They're changing the name of the county,

[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.020]
they're trying to eliminate the city of Miami,

[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.160]
they put it on the ballot,

[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.680]
which they should have done by the way.

[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.780]
That would have been the best thing that was ever done.

[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.400]
Eliminate the city of Miami.

[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.400]
I'm not talking about like geographically,

[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.000]
I'm talking about with neutron bombs.

[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.480]
Get rid of it.

[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.900]
And guess what, mine,

[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.860]
they're having a sucker game in the orange

[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.000]
for last night, man.

[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.700]
Get to the turnpike.

[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.920]
Two of the plastic is backed up and worth it.

[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.740]
And what the hell is going on over here now,

[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.240]
all of a sudden?

[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.500]
And you look out the window.

[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.660]
Here's all these Jamaican flags out the windows.

[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.520]
Yeah, man.

[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.560]
And it dawned on me that some asshole

[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.980]
called a show yesterday morning,

[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.160]
which you may or may not recall.

[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.920]
It said, forget about hockey,

[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.280]
it is that we got a great soccer game coming up tonight.

[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.060]
It's the orange ball.

[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.500]
What other city, other than maybe,

[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.900]
maybe, Geneva, New York,

[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.820]
what other city would have like two sporting events

[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.440]
first of all, the National Hockey League

[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.640]
or if it was the HETA NBA,

[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.700]
these are professional sporting events.

[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.420]
I don't know what kind of a bogus horse craft event this is.

[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.500]
The con cat calf gold cup at the orange ball.

[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.500]
What the hell is that?

[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.360]
With 43,000 and some illegal aliens there

[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.240]
through in the Manjala Ganja

[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.640]
or whatever the hell was going on.

[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.340]
Yeah, man.

[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.380]
And waving at Jamaican flags out the window,

[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.740]
with a goddamn stupid soccer game.

[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.740]
And by the way, guess what the final score was

[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.020]
of this thrilling soccer game last night?

[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.900]
No, no gold.

[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:04.580]
No gold.

[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.680]
Get out of here with this friend.

[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.240]
The final score in a big hit between Brazil

[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.560]
and Jamaica was two, no score, nothing.

[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.840]
Get out of here with this guy.

[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.140]
Soccer blows and a soccer fan,

[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.920]
get out of banana bone, okay?

[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.620]
Go find a nice island somewhere

[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.940]
where you can keep kicking it around

[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.780]
that 600-yard field over and back and forth

[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.520]
and forth and back it up and down.

[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.380]
It blows.

[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.480]
Nobody here gives a crap about soccer, man.

[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.780]
Except of course, all the 43,000

[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.120]
some illegal aliens who were down there watching the game.

[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.400]
Just jamming up the Hershey Highway.

[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.640]
Get out of I-95 and my lifetime,

[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.280]
I have never seen such an excruciating situation.

[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.440]
Get into the Miami arena.

[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.900]
Who are playing the defending Stanley Cup champions?

[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.840]
All these front-running ponies, of course,

[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.020]
with their red wing outfits on.

[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:51.880]
You know what I mean, Esther?

[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:52.980]
All these ponies.

[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.060]
And given the arena, it's now seven o'clock.

[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.720]
Ordinarily we get there six thirty

[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.560]
when they open the door.

[00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.480]
Seven o'clock.

[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.740]
Oh, yeah, the doors are wide open.

[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:01.800]
I'll write you walk inside.

[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.160]
There's nobody there except the two hundred people

[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.660]
who come from South Bay like Mr.

[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.340]
and Mrs. Howard Kleinberg and a few other people live

[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:08.940]
in South Bay.

[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:10.780]
That's it.

[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.540]
Those are the only people there.

[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.380]
And now they're pouring into the arena by the ones.

[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.560]
The crowd was just pouring in by the ones and twos

[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.860]
because nobody can get there.

[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.260]
This is the goddamn red wings, okay?

[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.800]
These are the Stanley Cup champions.

[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.160]
Even without Stevie, why a pretty damn hot team?

[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.280]
Come seven thirty that guy comes out

[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.840]
and sings a very grotesque way.

[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.400]
I think he was a fraud or something.

[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.740]
I know he might have been a Julio

[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.300]
because he said the whole day came you see

[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.040]
or something like that.

[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.240]
A grotesque rendition of the national anthem.

[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.920]
And now we're ready for the face off.

[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:39.700]
And here we go.

[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.740]
Macriori's ready to drop the puck opening face off.

[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:42.240]
You look around.

[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.820]
There couldn't have been three thousand people

[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.220]
in the stands for the start of the game.

[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.940]
And the people are like filenade.

[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.060]
Midway in the second period.

[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.600]
Are you following this midway in the second period?

[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.600]
I think was finally the end of people getting into the arena

[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.860]
because they couldn't get there

[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.260]
because of a stupid goddamn soccer game last night.

[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.140]
This is what you call great planning.

[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.500]
Now I hate to break the news to you,

[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.680]
but the hot NNA show after this weekend,

[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.880]
we got a three week hiatus for the Panthers

[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.860]
that one more home game for three weeks

[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.020]
because of the Olympic break.

[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.540]
And the heat guess what?

[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.680]
Don't play home every night.

[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.260]
Thank God.

[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.220]
So I am sure that if there was a little bit of coordination

[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.640]
which is award not a no vocabulary in Dave County,

[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.960]
Miami did excuse me.

[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.820]
If there was just a little bit of coordination,

[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.500]
they might have found some other goddamn night

[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.140]
to play their goddamn stupid horse ball soccer game.

[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.000]
That wound up thing with a score of two.

[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.280]
Oh my God.

[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.980]
But I mean, this is, I can't begin to tell you,

[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.660]
I will be the happiest human being on the face of the earth

[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.660]
when the last home game is played

[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.100]
in the Miami arena for the Panthers.

[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.880]
When we finally get into that new arena in the fall

[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.500]
and we don't have to make the trip down to Hershey Highway,

[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.060]
down the Ho Chi Minh Trail,

[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.500]
through 75 million illegal aliens on I-95,

[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.060]
all going to some stupid goddamn soccer game

[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.500]
with the Yamagawa Gondra.

[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.800]
So they're making flags out the window.

[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.100]
You know, totally unexpected.

[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.620]
And nobody of course in advance says,

[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.040]
by the way, it's gonna be a nightmare.

[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.420]
You might wanna leave a few minutes early

[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.340]
because it's gonna be a mess, baby.

[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.000]
And needless to say, of course, the orange bull exit,

[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:12.800]
guess what?

[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.440]
The Southwest 8th Street exit is right after

[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.640]
where you get off the go to the arena.

[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.240]
Right after the 395 exit is the,

[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.700]
or in there all jammed up there.

[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.720]
I mean, you're like five miles from there

[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.280]
and you can like see it almost,

[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.740]
but you know, you're never gonna get there.

[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.000]
If you live to be 200, you will never ever get there.

[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.640]
So my sympathies to those of you who do live in South-Aid

[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.260]
like the Climbbergs and a handful of others

[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.700]
who are dumb enough to still live down there

[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.960]
because you're gonna have a long, long trip starting next year.

[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.660]
But you know something, we've had five years.

[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.280]
Now the jokes on you guys.

[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.600]
We've had five years of this real pleasant, pleasant,

[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.880]
wonderful journey down to Hershey Highway,

[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.280]
which quite frankly isn't usually that bad.

[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.080]
But last night was the coup de gras.

[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.880]
That we're doing the coup de gras

[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.840]
in the car you could smell at the aroma,

[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.920]
the stench of Coleman,

[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.420]
or was like whopping throughout the county.

[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.140]
So thank you so much, all you soccer idiots, you.

[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.480]
And you can hop your china, you can call up Mon

[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.040]
and you can give us a song and a dance

[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.920]
about how great it was and about a beep and about a boop.

[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.960]
It's cock-eyed, terminal.

[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.300]
They could start 4,000 soccer league.

[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.680]
They can have 20 million little kids running around

[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.640]
with soccer balls.

[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.100]
And it's still ain't never gonna take off in this country

[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.840]
because it is coma inducing.

[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.260]
It is brewing.

[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.740]
What they make to feel a little bit bigger,

[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.980]
I think that was solved the problem.

[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.740]
How about 600 yards would be good.

[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.480]
And then maybe once during a soccer match,

[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.780]
they could actually get down in the offensive zone

[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.520]
and get near the goal of the other team.

[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.500]
And then by the time the game is over in two hours,

[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.860]
then they'll be back up at the other end.

[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.500]
Because it would accomplish the same thing that they do now.

[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.180]
Take your soccer balls, get on a banana boat

[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.220]
and go back wherever the hell you want to go, okay?

[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.520]
But don't do it here.

[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.440]
Get rid of it.

[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.180]
Am I making myself clear so far?

[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.560]
Am I making myself clear?

[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.580]
Yeah, I'm good.

[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.180]
Here's a pepper fine.

[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:53.520]
Hello.

[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.100]
Hello.

[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:55.760]
I'm just constantly.

[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.040]
Oh, it's a lady in pepper bar.

[00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.260]
I'm proud to be a Jamaican.

[00:13:59.500 --> 00:13:59.720]
Right.

[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.520]
Okay, and soccer is a national game.

[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.500]
Soccer sucks.

[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:03.980]
Yes.

[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.500]
And this has been a long time going,

[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.300]
long before you guys started basketball and football.

[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.380]
I don't care about basketball, I don't care about football.

[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.100]
We had a hockey game last night.

[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.820]
Well, it started long as a football team was a baby.

[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.780]
You are jealous because we are all chicken together.

[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.360]
People from all over came to see that game.

[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.440]
You were sticking together.

[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.580]
Maybe a little bad every night and would help, you know?

[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.300]
But you need a bad up your ass too.

[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.320]
A bad up my ass.

[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.900]
And if you are not in the basketball,

[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:29.840]
or it's kind of boring.

[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.560]
You talk about smoking weed and guns.

[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.260]
If you were smoking weed and gun,

[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.160]
you'd be conscious of what you've been talking.

[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:35.700]
Yeah.

[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.540]
By your talking pure shit.

[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.060]
Oh, okay.

[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.600]
There's the pole over the wall.

[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.060]
Oh,

[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:46.560]
Oh,

[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.580]
and she said it was pure shot too.

[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.560]
Not just, I'm just talking plain ordinary crap.

[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.520]
I'm talking pure shot is what you say with an eye.

[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:56.860]
Oh, that was beautiful.

[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.120]
Thank you so much, sweetheart.

[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.020]
We love you.

[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.720]
Yeah, that was the best.

[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.680]
Oh, man.

[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.940]
She said, if you stick a bad up your ass in my fly right

[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.280]
into your aim is something like that.

[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.400]
It wouldn't think that that tiny,

[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.700]
Tim thing would be in here with it.

[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.780]
Oh, that one is, but I don't have time for that whole.

[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:13.340]
Oh,

[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.580]
I don't want to hear the whole thing.

[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.260]
This is a dead end.

[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.920]
Oh, it is.

[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:18.560]
What's that under?

[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.120]
Old man, of course.

[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:20.500]
Oh, it's grown.

[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.440]
Just undergrown.

[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.480]
Oh, I didn't know that.

[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.640]
Well, that's a beautiful thing.

[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:24.400]

[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:25.880]
oh,

[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:26.720]
oh,

[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.140]
oh,

[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:28.720]
lovely.

[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.360]
Well, that must have been, I have no one

[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.600]
to talk about where I foster again.

[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.280]
That must have been bubble.

[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.040]
I'll just call him bubble.

[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.060]
That must have been him when he had that bleeding oozing

[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.640]
a problem from the acting time, which we will not talk about

[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.380]
on the ear again until tomorrow, maybe.

[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.500]
Why did he get upset about that?

[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.360]
I just don't understand.

[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.880]
Even the way I was chucking about that.

[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.240]
She said it with the bloodiest stool she ever said.

[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.300]
I mean, saw.

[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:48.780]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.140]
Hello.

[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:49.780]
Hello.

[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:50.580]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.380]
Yes, hi.

[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.160]
I was talking to you about the game.

[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.800]
I'm not happy what you're saying about your makin'.

[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.680]
First of all, because...

[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.520]
What I'm saying about your makin', what have I said

[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.180]
that isn't true?

[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:02.860]
What, what you said isn't true?

[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:03.540]
I don't know.

[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.460]
It's just boring.

[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.200]
I mean, it's just like, I got like one little stripe through it there.

[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.000]
It's not really...

[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.380]
So is your flag in the United States?

[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.660]
Wow, I've got stripes and stars, but I'm being in Bataboo.

[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.560]
What star?

[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:18.700]
What star?

[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.800]
Is there a star in the air?

[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.220]
I don't have a damn thing in it.

[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.620]
Let me tell you something.

[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.980]
I always represent the grass, the green grass, the yellow sun, okay?

[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.820]
And black of all black people.

[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.960]
The green grass, which you're smoking?

[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.460]
Well, you smoke it too.

[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:33.520]

[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:33.520]

[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:33.520]

[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:33.520]

[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:33.520]

[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:33.520]

[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:33.520]

[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.960]
I do not smoke weed, man.

[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.440]
Oh, you don't smoke a lot of weed.

[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.980]
I'm smoking a cigar though right now.

[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.660]
Well, okay, but he's made from it.

[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.480]
He's made from it.

[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:41.680]
It's made from it.

[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.720]
Cuban seed tobacco.

[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.660]
A little part of that is in there.

[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.220]
Okay.

[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.220]
A little bit of pots in there.

[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.160]
Yeah, I live in a showroom.

[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.640]
Everything from Jamaica is in there.

[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.980]
That flag is in there.

[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:51.500]
Uh-huh.

[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.040]
Okay.

[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.180]
First of all, we should have blocked your ass for 95 for you.

[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.100]
You wouldn't be able to come off.

[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.500]
I couldn't come off on 95, and my windows aren't chippin'.

[00:16:59.500 --> 00:16:59.780]
Good.

[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.060]
We should have threw something in there.

[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:01.480]
Uh-huh.

[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.000]
Okay.

[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.560]
And I'm just against the Jew as you are against the makin'.

[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:07.740]
Okay?

[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:08.820]
You're against the Jews?

[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:09.360]
Yeah.

[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.240]
Now, when did I say I was against your makin'?

[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:11.860]
I never said that.

[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.440]
You put words in my mouth, but you're also coming out of the closet as being just what I said before,

[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.660]
for when you're reminded and bigoted.

[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.060]
No.

[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.720]
And I'm sure you're also against the fags.

[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.120]
No, you were just as nomad.

[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.060]
I'm sure you're just right.

[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.560]
You hate the fag, it's right?

[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:23.780]
Oh, yes.

[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.500]
Oh, yes.

[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:25.220]
Oh, yes.

[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:25.740]
Oh, yes.

[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.880]
Why would you want to think up and just ask?

[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.400]
Diggin' someone's ass if you were a proctologist, you might.

[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.380]
Well, if you're looking for seeds to make a bell, you know, find a backyard.

[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.940]
A lot of refugal won't be up in your ass pretty soon.

[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.780]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.560]
A thing of okay, thank you so much.

[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.000]
She's the same bich that's called before.

[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.740]
That said that her shot didn't stick or something like that.

[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.380]
I guess she never got with Roy Foster when he had that problem.

[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.180]
Emma's not a been too, well, we don't want to get into it too deeply.

[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.260]
So there you go.

[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.320]
She hates the Jew, she hates the fags, she hates me, of course,

[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.320]
because I cover all that territory and lots more.

[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.420]
But she's a wonderful Jamaican man.

[00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.120]
Yeah, man.

[00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.000]
There you go.

[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.840]
Like I said, one way ticket and she don't like our flag either.

[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.460]
How do you like that?

[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.280]
I think it's a communist, a communist.

[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.580]
All the Cubans out there, you better watch yourselves.

[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:07.920]
You're surrounded by communistas.

[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.580]
Or you can't get the good weed.

[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.220]
If we ever said that Jamaicans back, you'll never get some really good weed anymore.

[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:13.940]
Colombians, we don't let them in.

[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.540]
For an outstanding selection of Italians,

[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:16.420]
8L.

[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.560]
So, uh, was the baby gravy life?

[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.940]
We're trying to got into what's happened to we should've been talking about years ago.

[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.400]
Long ago, if we only would've realized we had 600,000 Jamaicans,

[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.500]
just living here in the city of Miami alone.

[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.860]
And two minutes, what is it?

[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.280]
Two and a half million Jamaicans in Dayton,

[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.160]
Vard, put together, I don't know, that includes Palm Beach.

[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:36.980]
Because in this article, it's interesting.

[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.400]
It says Brazil's fans, absent promoters hopes of breaking a soft-footed

[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.120]
A soccer attendance record fell short,

[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.980]
conspicuous by their absence in Tuesday's crowd of 4,

[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.180]
8,000, 7, and 54 were Brazilian fans who in recent years have filled the orange bowl,

[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.420]
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.840]
But perhaps only 10% of Tuesday's crowd with pounding sambat drums

[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.820]
and worrying the blue green and yellow national colors of Brazil.

[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:03.440]
So that means there were like 4,000 Brazilian and 40,000 Jamaicans in that orange bowl last night.

[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.840]
40,000 Jamaicans?

[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.440]
And where do the Jamaicans, if they really live here,

[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.800]
if they're not illegal aliens, or came down from Alabama, or wherever they're hanging out?

[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.820]
I mean, where the hell do they live? Where are these people?

[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.880]
Have they infiltrated us very quietly?

[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.620]
Are they busy selling wheat on sweet corners in Little Havana?

[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.920]
They're landing in the city of Miami.

[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.660]
In the city of Miami, so in Jerk pork and Jerk chicken, is that Haitian?

[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.540]
That's your bacon.

[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.160]
Yeah, Jerk pork.

[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.200]
Well, Haitians don't have any food at all.

[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:36.580]
Well, I know they're not doing too well, but I mean, they must have some food to reproduce like that.

[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.920]
So, but seriously, we've got the different ethnic groups.

[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.040]
We all know about the Cubans, and there's some people who love Cubans, some people hate Cubans.

[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:46.020]
I love kind of like, you know, the young Cubans, I love a lot, the ones that listen to the show, the guys.

[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.780]
And then we got, of course, our American, well, we don't know what to call them anymore.

[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.980]
Just regular plain old black folks, African American, which I hate that.

[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.480]
Just black guys, women, whatever, which they're okay as long as they stay put.

[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.680]
And in, of course, the Haitians, which, like you said, they haven't got two nickels throughout together.

[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.760]
And they're busy selling the baseballs, which is good.

[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.800]
That's something very productive.

[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.400]
We like that.

[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.680]
And they don't seem to bother anybody as long as they're in Miami, or on business, and stay out of their neighborhood.

[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:17.360]
And that leaves the Jamaicans, who seem to be the question mark ethnic group in South Florida.

[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.960]
And today, I think we're going to find a lot more out about the Jamaican.

[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.040]
Like that little right, huh?

[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.720]
They're not on welfare. They have jobs. They go to work.

[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.700]
What do you mean they're not on welfare? Is the, are you suggesting that there are others who are on welfare and don't have jobs?

[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.120]
Is that what you be suggesting?

[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.420]
Yeah, like Americans, black, white, and miscellaneous.

[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:35.340]
And Cubans.

[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.100]
Cuban American.

[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.220]
No, Cubans are not on welfare.

[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.880]
There are no Cubans on welfare.

[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.360]
Most are ineligible anyway, like myself, my God.

[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.520]
Thank God for that. Thank God.

[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.540]
So I was thinking like, Mary Lito, as they never got any food stamps or stuff when they came over here,

[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.800]
or driver license right away, they got off the banana boat.

[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.180]
That's different.

[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.540]
Mary Lito.

[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.720]
But they're probably not either.

[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.920]
What do you mean that was really cool?

[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.080]
That was not illegal. I'm not talking about the ones that came in illegally.

[00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.200]
I'm talking about the ones governor Graham Welton, with open arms standing down around the shores.

[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.920]
So Bob Barker was standing right there next to him.

[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.620]
Let me know down.

[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.960]
And be sure to get your children spayed and neutered.

[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.140]
But I guess they weren't listening.

[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:07.900]
Okay, anyway.

[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.640]
Let's do a Miramar. Hello.

[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:10.520]
Miramar.

[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:11.600]
Yes.

[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:12.980]
I had a question.

[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.400]
If that dead born again, Christian bitch.

[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.020]
Yeah.

[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:16.460]
Yeah.

[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:16.700]
Leave that.

[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.220]
Heaven was like the ultimate reward.

[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.920]
And it was so much better than life on earth.

[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:20.340]
Yeah.

[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.620]
Why'd she try to save her own life?

[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.260]
All because they could be at the excuse they were given yesterday was well, but she's got so much to contribute.

[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.260]
And she still has so much work to do here.

[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:28.820]
Haha.

[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.340]
You won't be doing no more work here, boy.

[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:31.840]
Yeah.

[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.540]
She's dead.

[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.580]
Here's a good idea.

[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:39.320]
Well, all the Christians who want to be in heaven, when I don't pick active, kill each other, the son, the ones that they're killing,

[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.560]
have to where they want to be.

[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:40.900]
Oh, right.

[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.240]
And then they get the electric chair or the needle or whatever.

[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:44.460]
Right.

[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.320]
And they'll be there too.

[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.080]
Sounds good to me.

[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.620]
And you can start with OG and Johnny Cochran.

[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.020]
Excellent.

[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:48.880]
Have a good one.

[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:49.260]
Okay.

[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:49.920]
So, what's the question?

[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:50.940]
Haha.

[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.460]
What is the question?

[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.880]
The question was about your makings.

[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.820]
But this guy's too worried about flying born again, Christian.

[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:57.860]
Not a bad idea.

[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:58.980]
He was wrong with that.

[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:06.040]
See, the arrogance, that thing in Texas was a classic example of the arrogance of most religious groups.

[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.240]
Not just born again, Christians or Catholic or Jews or Orthodox, whatever.

[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.180]
But I'll be religious groups.

[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.900]
Think that because their stuff don't stink and their God is the right one.

[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.120]
Therefore, we bend the rules for us.

[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.120]
Even though she was convicted in a court of law, she killed these two people with a pickaxe.

[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.880]
And we already know while she was on drugs, he's got this excuse.

[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.800]
But she found Jesus and she's born again.

[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.700]
And therefore, because of that, that was should make an exception.

[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.780]
The law doesn't really count, which of course proved that a lot of born again Christians think that there was a law.

[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.020]
Like the ones who are busy bombing abortion clinics in Birmingham and elsewhere, etc.

[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:37.520]
And so on.

[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.240]
And in Calahassia and Pensacola.

[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.000]
God's law.

[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:43.020]

[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.760]
And Cal Thomas knows God law.

[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.020]
Just read the Assumption Law.

[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.540]
Let us do the editor this morning.

[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.000]
Because the born again, they know what morality is and you damn love better listen to them.

[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.600]
Because their definition of morality is what everybody else is going to do.

[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.800]
Good enough for the president.

[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.540]
Good enough for me.

[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.140]
Here's the four-letter mail.

[00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:58.540]
Hello.

[00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.740]
Hey, Neil.

[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.900]
When you 20-year-old circumfised you here.

[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:03.520]
All right.

[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.680]
I want to put my vote in for the Jamaicans.

[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.140]
Okay.

[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:06.860]
I love them.

[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.980]
I love the Jamaicans.

[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.160]
We want them to understand that.

[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:09.420]
Yes.

[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.020]
They're the ones in our neighborhood here.

[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.260]
They are my, I have some neighbors there to make them.

[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:14.320]
They are wonderful people.

[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.220]
And they don't smoke on you.

[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:16.620]
Yeah.

[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.760]
We just want them to play their soccer with a more convenient time for all the rest of us.

[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.420]
Hey, now it's Florida Panther hockey.

[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.560]
And we better than Jamaican soccer right now.

[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:23.900]
Yes.

[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:24.660]
It is.

[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.480]
Yes, it is.

[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.160]
I don't know.

[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.580]
Maybe we're going to be able to talk about it.

[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.780]
Any hockey, Chini hockey would be better than any kind of soccer.

[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:31.160]
Sure.

[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.800]
Soccer is terminal and there is no case to be made for it.

[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.080]
I don't have a particular opinion.

[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.300]
We've been in people all over the world sitting right now.

[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.180]
Taring each other's hair out over their soccer jersey.

[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.180]
Soccer is terminal.

[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.860]
Make no mistake about it.

[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.920]
But not after a couple of nights you make them do these.

[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:47.440]
Yeah, right.

[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:48.680]
Well, that goes to show you.

[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:49.780]
That's all you need.

[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.820]
Maybe if they don't put up a weed contest if you're reading,

[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.120]
we'd enjoy the hockey games more.

[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:53.860]
Hey, I'd run it.

[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:54.480]
Okay.

[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.960]
I'm the first on the man for that job.

[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:56.880]
You're hired.

[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.240]
All right, everybody in the radio, back at your douchebag.

[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.660]
Okay, and put your Yamakou away.

[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:01.180]
Have a good one.

[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:01.440]
Good night.

[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.940]
And your tits is too.

[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:07.120]
So now in the middle of the show, after getting into a big style of dance with our Jamaican friends,

[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.220]
now Greg Reats says, oh, it's a great show.

[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:09.860]
But guess what?

[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.000]
We're right in the middle of Little Jamaica here, man.

[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.800]
And by the way, I'm leaving for the day, said Greg Reed.

[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.160]
No doubt.

[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.220]
He's on his way out.

[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.920]
I mean, today, here's a mobile in Pember Pine.

[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:19.240]
Hello?

[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:20.100]
Hey, I'm on.

[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:20.680]
You're on.

[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.980]
Oh, yeah, I've got no material, but I have a burning question.

[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:23.460]
Yeah.

[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:28.840]
Where in when did you get that, that, that, that's a copy or that, or, or,

[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.340]
that's a marriage thing.

[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.840]
I want to bang you in the butt.

[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.300]
You know something, um, Robert, who's one of our board ops at the,

[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.720]
you know, the station, a fine American brought it in.

[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.340]
He brought it and taped it all our stuff in it.

[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.400]
I've been wondering that myself.

[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.200]
I wondered the contents that keep asking myself what conversation was going on on the

[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.540]
year when I entered.

[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.700]
I want to bang you in the butt, honey.

[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.040]
In Georgia, but I like a room interview.

[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.620]
It was a locker room interview.

[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:54.040]
Oh, I bet it was with Danny Boyd is what I heard.

[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:54.780]
That's right.

[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:55.340]
Thank you for coming.

[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.000]
Okay, pal.

[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.080]
Thank you.

[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:57.080]

[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.680]
Thank you guys for being on when he said, oh, my God, your breasts are beautiful.

[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:01.440]
That was my,
